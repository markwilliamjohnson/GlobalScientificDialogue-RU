<span id="bookmark3">About</span> *Principles of Macroeconomics 2e*

Principles of Macroeconomics 2e <span class="p">(2nd edition) covers the
scope and sequence requirements of most introductory macroeconomics
courses. The text includes many current examples, which are handled in a
politically equitable way. The outcome is a balanced approach to both
Keynesian and classical views, and to the theory and application of
economics concepts. The second edition has been thoroughly revised to
increase clarity, update data and current event impacts, and incorporate
the feedback from many reviewers and adopters.</span>

Coverage and scope

To develop the first edition of *Principles of Macroeconomics*, we
acquired the rights to Timothy Taylor’s *Principles of Economics* and
solicited ideas from economics instructors at all levels of higher
education, from community colleges to PhD-granting universities. For the
second edition, we received even more expansive and actionable feedback
from hundreds of adopters who had used the book for several academic
terms. These knowledgeable instructors informed the pedagogical courses,
learning objective development and fulfillment, and the chapter
arrangements. Faculty who taught from the material provided critical and
detailed commentary.

  

  

The result is a book that covers the breadth of economics topics and
also provides the necessary depth to ensure the course is manageable for
instructors and students alike. We strove to balance theory and
application, as well as the amount of calculation and mathematical
examples.

The book is organized into seven main parts:

What is Economics? <span class="p">The first two chapters introduce
students to the study of economics with a focus on making choices in a
world of scarce resources.</span>

Supply and Demand<span class="p">, Chapters 3 and 4, introduces and
explains the first analytical model in economics: supply, demand, and
equilibrium, before showing applications in the markets for labor and
finance.</span>

Elasticity and Price<span class="p">, Chapter 5, introduces and explains
elasticity and price, two key concepts in economics.</span>

The Macroeconomic Perspective and Goals<span class="p">, Chapters 6
through 10, introduces a number of key concepts in macro: economic
growth, unemployment and inflation, and international trade and capital
flows.</span>

A Framework for Macroeconomic Analysis<span class="p">, Chapters 11
through 13, introduces the principal analytic model in macro, namely the
aggregate demand/aggregate supply Model. The model is then applied to
the Keynesian and Neoclassical perspectives. The expenditure-output
model is fully explained in a stand-alone appendix.</span>

Monetary and Fiscal Policy<span class="p">, Chapters 14 through 18,
explains the role of money and the banking system, as well as monetary
policy and financial regulation. Then the discussion switches to
government deficits and fiscal policy.</span>

International Economics<span class="p">, Chapters 19 through 21, the
final part of the text, introduces the international dimensions of
economics, including international trade and protectionism.</span>

Alternate Sequencing

Principles of Macroeconomics 2e <span class="p">was conceived and
written to fit a particular topical sequence, but it can be used
flexibly to accommodate other course structures. One such potential
structure, which will fit reasonably well with the textbook content, is
provided below. Please consider, however, that the chapters were not
written to be completely independent, and that the proposed alternate
sequence should be carefully considered for student preparation and
textual consistency.</span>

Changes to the second edition

OpenStax only undertakes revisions when significant modifications to a
text are necessary. In the case of *Principles of Macroeconomics*, we
received a wealth of constructive feedback. Many of the book’s users
felt that consequential movement in economic data, coupled with the
impacts of national and global events, warranted a full revision. We
also took advantage of the opportunity to improve the writing and
sequencing of the text, as well as many of the calculation examples. The
major changes are summarized below.

Augmented explanations in chapters one through four provide a more
comprehensive and informative foundation for the book.

A clearer explanation, using a numerical example, has been given for
finding the utility maximizing combination of goods and services a
consumer should choose.

The Theory of Production has been added to the chapter on costs &
industry structure.

A more complete treatment has been given to labor markets, including the
theories of competitive and monopsonistic labor markets, and bilateral
monopoly; and the labor markets chapter and the poverty and economic
inequality chapter have been resequenced.

Substantial revisions to the AD/AS model in chapters 11-13 present the
core concepts of macroeconomics in a clearer, more dynamic manner.

Case studies and examples have been revised and, in some cases, replaced
to provide more relevant and useful information for students.

Economic data, tables, and graphs, as well as discussion and analysis
around that data, have been thoroughly updated.

Wherever possible, data from the Federal Reserve Economic Database
(FRED) was included and referenced. In most of these uses, links to the
direct source of the FRED data are provided, and students are encouraged
to explore the information and the overall FRED resources more
thoroughly.

Additional updates and revisions appear throughout the book. They
reflect changes to economic realities and policies regarding
international trade, taxation, insurance, and other topics. For issues
that may change in the months or years following the textbook's
publication, the authors often provided a more open-ended explanation,
but we will update the text annually to address further changes.

The revision of *Principles of Macroeconomics* was undertaken by Steven
Greenlaw (University of Mary Washington) and David Shapiro (Pennsylvania
State University), with significant input by lead reviewer Daniel
MacDonald (California State University, San Bernardino).

Pedagogical foundation

Throughout *Principles of Macroeconomics 2e*, you will find features
that engage the students in economic inquiry and support their learning.
Our features include:

Bring It Home: <span class="p">This added feature is a brief case study,
specific to each chapter, which connects the chapter’s main topic to the
real word. It is broken up into two parts: the first at the beginning of
the chapter (in the intro module) and the second at chapter’s end, when
students have learned what’s necessary to understand the case and “bring
home” the chapter’s core concepts.</span>

Work It Out: <span class="p">This added feature asks students to work
through a generally analytical or computational problem, and guides them
step by step to find out how its solution is derived.</span>

Clear It Up: <span class="p">This boxed feature, which includes
pre-existing features from Taylor’s text, addresses common student
misconceptions about the content. Clear It Ups are usually deeper
explanations of something in the main body of the text. Each CIU starts
with a question. The rest of the feature explains the answer.</span>

Link It Up: <span class="p">This added feature is a very brief
introduction to a website that is pertinent to students’ understanding
and enjoyment of the topic at hand.</span>

Questions for each level of learning

Principles of Macroeconomics 2e <span class="p">offers four types of
end-of-module questions for students:</span>

Self-Checks <span class="p">are analytical self-assessment questions
that appear at the end of each module. They “click to</span>

  

  

reveal” an answer in the web view so students can check their
understanding before moving on to the next module. Self-Check questions
are not simple look-up questions. They push the student to think beyond
what is said in the text. Self-Check questions are designed for
formative (rather than summative) assessment. The questions and answers
are explained so that students feel like they are being walked through
the problem.

**Review Questions** have been retained from Taylor’s version, and are
simple recall questions from the chapter in open-response format
(<u>not</u> multiple choice or true/false). The answers can be looked up
in the text.

**Critical Thinking Questions** are new higher-level, conceptual
questions that ask students to *demonstrate their understanding by
applying* what they have learned in different contexts. They ask for
outside-the-box thinking, for *reasoning* about the concepts. They push
the student to places they wouldn’t have thought of going themselves.

Problems <span class="p">are exercises that give students additional
practice working with the analytic and computational concepts in the
module.</span>

Updated art

Principles of Macroeconomics 2e <span class="p">includes an updated art
program to better inform today’s student, providing the latest data on
covered topics.</span>

    Decisions ... Decisions in the Social Media Age

    To post or not to post? Every day we are faced with a myriad of
    decisions, from what to have for breakfast, to which route to take
    to class, to the more complex—“Should I double major and add
    possibly another semester of study to my education?” Our response to
    these choices depends on the information we have available at any
    given moment. Economists call this “imperfect” because we rarely
    have all the data we need to make perfect decisions. Despite the
    lack of perfect information, we still make hundreds of decisions a
    day.

    Now we have another avenue in which to gather information—social
    media. Outlets like Facebook and Twitter are altering the process by
    which we make choices, how we spend our time, which movies we see,
    which products we buy, and more. How many of you chose a university
    without checking out its Facebook page or Twitter stream first for
    information and feedback?

    As you will see in this course, what happens in economics is
    affected by how well and how fast information disseminates through a
    society, such as how quickly information travels through Facebook.
    “Economists love nothing better than when deep and liquid markets
    operate under conditions of perfect information,” says Jessica
    Irvine, National Economics Editor for News Corp Australia.

    This leads us to the topic of this chapter, an introduction to the
    world of making decisions, processing

      

    information, and understanding behavior in markets —the world of
    economics. Each chapter in this book will start with a discussion
    about current (or sometimes past) events and revisit it at chapter’s
    end—to “bring home” the concepts in play.

      

    #### Introduction

    In this chapter, you will learn about:

    -   What Is Economics, and Why Is It Important?

    -   Microeconomics and Macroeconomics

    -   How Economists Use Theories and Models to Understand Economic
        Issues

    -   How Economies Can Be Organized: An Overview of Economic Systems

      

    What is economics and why should you spend your time learning it?
    After all, there are other disciplines you could be studying, and
    other ways you could be spending your time. As the Bring it Home
    feature just mentioned, making choices is at the heart of what
    economists study, and your decision to take this course is as much
    as economic decision as anything else.

    Economics is probably not what you think. It is not primarily about
    money or finance. It is not primarily about business. It is not
    mathematics. What is it then? It is both a subject area and a way of
    viewing the world.

        style=" color: #3767B1;">What Is Economics, and Why Is It
        Important?</span><span id="bookmark15">‌</span>

        By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        -   Discuss the importance of studying economics

        -   Explain the relationship between production and division of
            labor

        -   Evaluate the significance of scarcity

              

            <span id="bookmark16">Economics</span> <span class="p">is
            the study of how humans make decisions in the face of
            scarcity. These can be individual decisions, family
            decisions, business decisions or societal decisions. If you
            look around carefully, you will see that scarcity is a fact
            of life. </span>Scarcity <span class="p">means that human
            wants for goods, services and resources exceed what is
            available. Resources, such as labor, tools, land, and raw
            materials are necessary to produce the goods and services we
            want but they exist in limited supply. Of course, the
            ultimate scarce resource is time- everyone, rich or poor,
            has just 24 expendable hours in the day to earn income to
            acquire goods and services, for leisure time, or for sleep.
            At any point in time, there is only a finite amount of
            resources available.</span><span id="bookmark17">‌</span>

            Think about it this way: In 2015 the labor force in the
            United States contained over 158 million workers, according
            to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The total land area
            was 3,794,101 square miles. While these are certainly large
            numbers, they are not infinite. Because these resources are
            limited, so are the numbers of goods and services we produce
            with them. Combine this with the fact that human wants seem
            to be virtually infinite, and you can see why scarcity is a
            problem.

            Introduction to FRED

            <a href="https://openstax.org/l/FRED/" class="s34">Data is very important in economics because it describes and measures the issues and problems that economics seek to understand. A variety of government agencies publish economic and social data. For this course, we will generally use data from the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank's FRED database. FRED is very user friendly. It allows you to display data in tables or charges, and you can easily download it into spreadsheet form if you want to use the data for other purposes. The</a>

            <span class="p">includes data on nearly 400,000 domestic and
            international variables over time, in the following broad
            categories:</span>

        -   Money, Banking & Finance

        -   Population, Employment, & Labor Markets (including Income
            Distribution)

              

              

        -   National Accounts (Gross Domestic Product & its components),
            Flow of Funds, and International Accounts

        -   Production & Business Activity (including Business Cycles)

            Producer Price Index, and the Employment Cost Index)

            <a href="#bookmark18" class="s34">If you still do not believe that scarcity is a problem, consider the following: Does everyone require food to eat? Does everyone need a decent place to live? Does everyone have access to healthcare? In every country in the world, there are people who are hungry, homeless (for example, those who call park benches their beds, as</a>
            <a href="#bookmark18" class="a">Figure 1.2</a> <span
            class="p">shows), and in need of healthcare, just to focus
            on a few critical goods and services. Why is this the case?
            It is because of scarcity. Let’s delve into the concept of
            scarcity a little deeper, because it is crucial to
            understanding economics.</span>

            The Problem of Scarcity

            <span style=" color: #000;">to read about how the United
            States is dealing with scarcity in resources.</span>

            Think about all the things you consume: food, shelter,
            clothing, transportation, healthcare, and entertainment. How
            do you acquire those items? You do not produce them
            yourself. You buy them. How do you afford the things you
            buy? You work for pay. If you do not, someone else does on
            your behalf. Yet most of us never have enough income to buy
            all the things we want. This is because of scarcity. So how
            do we solve it?

              

              

            <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_030.png" width="624" height="160" alt="image" />

              

            <span id="bookmark19">Every society, at every level, must
            make choices about how to use its resources. Families must
            decide whether to spend their money on a new car or a fancy
            vacation. Towns must choose whether to put more of the
            budget into police and fire protection or into the school
            system. Nations must decide whether to devote more funds to
            national defense or to protecting the environment. In most
            cases, there just isn’t enough money in the budget to do
            everything. How do we use our limited resources the best way
            possible, that is, to obtain the most goods and services we
            can? There are a couple of options. First, we could each
            produce everything we each consume. Alternatively, we could
            each produce some of what we want to consume, and “trade”
            for the rest of what we want. Let’s explore these options.
            Why do we not each just produce all of the things we
            consume? Think back to pioneer days, when individuals knew
            how to do so much more than we do today, from building their
            homes, to growing their crops, to hunting for food, to
            repairing their equipment. Most of us do not know how to do
            all—or any—of those things, but it is not because we could
            not learn. Rather, we do not have to. The reason why is
            something called</span> *the division and specialization of
            labor*<a href="#bookmark20" class="s34">, a production innovation first put forth by Adam Smith (</a><a href="#bookmark20" class="a">Figure</a>
            <span class="s54">1.3</span>) in his book, *The Wealth of

            The Division of and Specialization of Labor

            <span id="bookmark21">The formal study of economics began
            when Adam Smith (1723–1790) published his famous book</span>
            *The Wealth of Nations* in 1776. Many authors had written on
            economics in the centuries before Smith, but he was the
            first to address the subject in a comprehensive way. In the
            first chapter, Smith introduces the concept of **division of
            labor**, which means that the way one produces a good or
            service is divided into a number of tasks that different
            workers perform, instead of all the tasks being done by the
            same person.

            To illustrate division of labor, Smith counted how many
            tasks went into making a pin: drawing out a piece of wire,
            cutting it to the right length, straightening it, putting a
            head on one end and a point on the other, and packaging pins
            for sale, to name just a few. Smith counted 18 distinct
            tasks that different people performed—all for a pin, believe
            it or not!

            Modern businesses divide tasks as well. Even a relatively
            simple business like a restaurant divides the task of
            serving meals into a range of jobs like top chef, sous
            chefs, less-skilled kitchen help, servers to wait on the
            tables, a greeter at the door, janitors to clean up, and a
            business manager to handle paychecks and bills—not to
            mention the economic

              

              

            <a href="#bookmark22" class="s34">connections a restaurant has with suppliers of food, furniture, kitchen equipment, and the building where it is located. A complex business like a large manufacturing factory, such as the shoe factory (</a><a href="#bookmark22" class="a">Figure</a>
            1.4<span class="p">), or a hospital can have hundreds of job
            classifications.</span>

            Why the Division of Labor Increases Production

            When we divide and subdivide the tasks involved with
            producing a good or service, workers and businesses can
            produce a greater quantity of output. In his observations of
            pin factories, Smith noticed that one worker alone might
            make 20 pins in a day, but that a small business of 10
            workers (some of whom would need to complete two or three of
            the 18 tasks involved with pin-making), could make 48,000
            pins in a day. How can a group of workers, each specializing
            in certain tasks, produce so much more than the same number
            of workers who try to produce the entire good or service by
            themselves? Smith offered three reasons.

            <span id="bookmark23">First,</span> **specialization** in a
            particular small job allows workers to focus on the parts of
            the production process where they have an advantage. (In
            later chapters, we will develop this idea by discussing
            comparative advantage.) People have different skills,
            talents, and interests, so they will be better at some jobs
            than at others. The particular advantages may be based on
            educational choices, which are in turn shaped by interests
            and talents. Only those with medical degrees qualify to
            become doctors, for instance. For some goods, geography
            affects specialization. For example, it is easier to be a
            wheat farmer in North Dakota than in Florida, but easier to
            run a tourist hotel in Florida than in North Dakota. If you
            live in or near a big city, it is easier to attract enough
            customers to operate a successful dry cleaning business or
            movie theater than if you live in a sparsely populated rural
            area. Whatever the reason, if people specialize in the
            production of what they do best, they will be more effective
            than if they produce a combination of things, some of which
            they are good at and some of which they are not.<span
            id="bookmark24">‌</span>

            Second, workers who specialize in certain tasks often learn
            to produce more quickly and with higher quality. This
            pattern holds true for many workers, including assembly line
            laborers who build cars, stylists who cut hair, and doctors
            who perform heart surgery. In fact, specialized workers
            often know their jobs well enough to suggest innovative ways
            to do their work faster and better.

            <span id="bookmark25">A similar pattern often operates
            within businesses. In many cases, a business that focuses on
            one or a few products (sometimes called its “core
            competency”) is more successful than firms that try to make
            a wide range of products.</span>

            <span id="bookmark26">Third, specialization allows
            businesses to take advantage of</span> **economies of
            scale**, which means that for many goods, as the level of
            production increases, the average cost of producing each
            individual unit declines. For example, if a factory produces
            only 100 cars per year, each car will be quite expensive to
            make on average. However, if a factory produces 50,000 cars
            each year, then it can set up an assembly line with huge
            machines and workers performing specialized tasks, and the
            average cost of production per car will be lower. The
            ultimate result of workers who can focus on their
            preferences and talents, learn to do their specialized jobs
            better, and work in larger organizations is that society as
            a whole can produce and consume far more than if each person
            tried to produce all of his or her own goods and services.
            The division and specialization of labor has been a force
            against the problem of scarcity.

              

            Trade and Markets

            Specialization only makes sense, though, if workers can use
            the pay they receive for doing their jobs to purchase the
            other goods and services that they need. In short,
            specialization requires trade.

            You do not have to know anything about electronics or sound
            systems to play music—you just buy an iPod or MP3 player,
            download the music, and listen. You do not have to know
            anything about artificial fibers or the construction of
            sewing machines if you need a jacket—you just buy the jacket
            and wear it. You do not need to know anything about internal
            combustion engines to operate a car—you just get in and
            drive. Instead of trying to acquire all the knowledge and
            skills involved in producing all of the goods and services
            that you wish to consume, the market allows you to learn a
            specialized set of skills and then use the pay you receive
            to buy the goods and services you need or want. This is how
            our modern society has evolved into a strong economy.

            Why Study Economics?

            Now that you have an overview on what economics studies,
            let’s quickly discuss why you are right to study it.
            Economics is not primarily a collection of facts to
            memorize, although there are plenty of important concepts to
            learn. Instead, think of economics as a collection of
            questions to answer or puzzles to work. Most importantly,
            economics provides the tools to solve those puzzles. If the
            economics “bug” has not bitten you yet, there are other
            reasons why you should study economics.

        -   Virtually every major problem facing the world today, from
            global warming, to world poverty, to the conflicts in Syria,
            Afghanistan, and Somalia, has an economic dimension. If you
            are going to be part of solving those problems, you need to
            be able to understand them. Economics is crucial.

        -   It is hard to overstate the importance of economics to good
            citizenship. You need to be able to vote intelligently on
            budgets, regulations, and laws in general. When the U.S.
            government came close to a standstill at the end of 2012 due
            to the “fiscal cliff,” what were the issues? Did you know?

        -   A basic understanding of economics makes you a well-rounded
            thinker. When you read articles about economic issues, you
            will understand and be able to evaluate the writer’s
            argument. When you hear classmates, co-workers, or political
            candidates talking about economics, you will be able to
            distinguish between common sense and nonsense. You will find
            new ways of thinking about current events and about personal
            and business decisions, as well as current events and
            politics.

        The study of economics does not dictate the answers, but it can
        illuminate the different choices.

        Macroeconomics</span><span id="bookmark27">‌</span>

        By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        -   Describe microeconomics

        -   Describe macroeconomics

        -   Contrast monetary policy and fiscal policy

          

        Economics is concerned with the well-being of *all* people,
        including those with jobs and those without jobs, as well as
        those with high incomes and those with low incomes. Economics
        acknowledges that production of useful goods and services can
        create problems of environmental pollution. It explores the
        question of how investing in education helps to develop workers’
        skills. It probes questions like how to tell when big businesses
        or big labor unions are operating in a way that benefits society
        as a whole and when they are operating in a way that benefits
        their owners or members at the expense of others. It looks at
        how government spending, taxes, and regulations affect decisions
        about production and consumption.

        <span id="bookmark28">It should be clear by now that economics
        covers considerable ground. We can divide that ground into two
        parts:</span> **Microeconomics** focuses on the actions of
        individual agents within the economy, like households, workers,
        and businesses. **Macroeconomics** looks at the economy as a
        whole. It focuses on broad issues such as growth of production,
        the number of unemployed people, the inflationary increase in
        prices, government deficits, and levels of exports and imports.
        Microeconomics and macroeconomics are not separate subjects, but
        rather complementary perspectives on the overall subject of the
        economy.<span id="bookmark29">‌</span>

          

          

        To understand why both microeconomic and macroeconomic
        perspectives are useful, consider the problem of studying a
        biological ecosystem like a lake. One person who sets out to
        study the lake might focus on specific topics: certain kinds of
        algae or plant life; the characteristics of particular fish or
        snails; or the trees surrounding the lake. Another person might
        take an overall view and instead consider the lake's ecosystem
        from top to bottom; what eats what, how the system stays in a
        rough balance, and what environmental stresses affect this
        balance. Both approaches are useful, and both examine the same
        lake, but the viewpoints are different. In a similar way, both
        microeconomics and macroeconomics study the same economy, but
        each has a different viewpoint.

        Whether you are scrutinizing lakes or economics, the micro and
        the macro insights should blend with each other. In studying a
        lake, the micro insights about particular plants and animals
        help to understand the overall food chain, while the macro
        insights about the overall food chain help to explain the
        environment in which individual plants and animals live.

        In economics, the micro decisions of individual businesses are
        influenced by whether the macroeconomy is healthy. For example,
        firms will be more likely to hire workers if the overall economy
        is growing. In turn, macroeconomy's performance ultimately
        depends on the microeconomic decisions that individual
        households and businesses make.

        Microeconomics

        What determines how households and individuals spend their
        budgets? What combination of goods and services will best fit
        their needs and wants, given the budget they have to spend? How
        do people decide whether to work, and if so, whether to work
        full time or part time? How do people decide how much to save
        for the future, or whether they should borrow to spend beyond
        their current means?

        What determines the products, and how many of each, a firm will
        produce and sell? What determines the prices a firm will charge?
        What determines how a firm will produce its products? What
        determines how many workers it will hire? How will a firm
        finance its business? When will a firm decide to expand,
        downsize, or even close? In the microeconomics part of this
        book, we will learn about the theory of consumer behavior, the
        theory of the firm, how markets for labor and other resources
        work, and how markets sometimes fail to work properly.

        Macroeconomics

        What determines the level of economic activity in a society? In
        other words, what determines how many goods and services a
        nation actually produces? What determines how many jobs are
        available in an economy? What determines a nation’s standard of
        living? What causes the economy to speed up or slow down? What
        causes firms to hire more workers or to lay them off? Finally,
        what causes the economy to grow over the long term?

        <span id="bookmark30">We can determine an economy's
        macroeconomic health by examining a number of goals: growth in
        the standard of living, low unemployment, and low inflation, to
        name the most important. How can we use government macroeconomic
        policy to pursue these goals? A nation's central bank
        conducts</span> **monetary policy**, which involves policies
        that affect bank lending, interest rates, and financial capital
        markets. For the United States, this is the Federal Reserve. A
        nation's legislative body determines **fiscal policy**, which
        involves government spending and taxes. For the United States,
        this is the Congress and the executive branch, which originates
        the federal budget. These are the government's main tools.
        Americans tend to expect that government can fix whatever
        economic problems we encounter, but to what extent is that
        expectation realistic? These are just some of the issues that we
        will explore in the macroeconomic chapters of this book.<span

        <span style=" color: #000;">about John Maynard Keynes and his
        influence on economics.</span>

        <a href="#bookmark33" id="bookmark34" class="s34">John Maynard Keynes (1883–1946), one of the greatest economists of the twentieth century, pointed out that economics is not just a subject area but also a way of thinking. Keynes (</a><a href="#bookmark33" class="a">Figure</a>
        1.5<span class="p">) famously wrote in the introduction to a
        fellow economist’s book: “\[Economics\] is a method rather than
        a doctrine, an apparatus of the mind, a technique of thinking,
        which helps its possessor to draw correct conclusions.” In other
        words, economics teaches you how to think, not what to
        think.</span>

          

          

        <span id="bookmark35">Economists see the world through a
        different lens than anthropologists, biologists, classicists, or
        practitioners of any other discipline. They analyze issues and
        problems using economic theories that are based on particular
        assumptions about human behavior. These assumptions tend to be
        different than the assumptions an anthropologist or psychologist
        might use. A</span> **theory** is a simplified representation of
        how two or more variables interact with each other. The purpose
        of a theory is to take a complex, real-world issue and simplify
        it down to its essentials. If done well, this enables the
        analyst to understand the issue and any problems around it. A
        good theory is simple enough to understand, while complex enough
        to capture the key features of the object or situation you are
        studying.

        <span id="bookmark36">Sometimes economists use the term</span>
        **model** instead of theory. Strictly speaking, a theory is a
        more abstract representation, while a model is a more applied or
        empirical representation. We use models to test theories, but
        for this course we will use the terms interchangeably.

        For example, an architect who is planning a major office
        building will often build a physical model that sits on a
        tabletop to show how the entire city block will look after the
        new building is constructed. Companies often build models of
        their new products, which are more rough and unfinished than the
        final product, but can still demonstrate how the new product
        will work.

        <span id="bookmark37">A good model to start with in economics is
        the</span> **circular flow diagram**
        <a href="#bookmark40" class="s34">(</a><a href="#bookmark40" class="a">Figure</a>
        <span class="s54">1.6</span>). It pictures the economy as
        consisting of two groups—households and firms—that interact in
        two markets: the **goods and services market** in which firms
        sell and households buy and the **labor market** in which
        households sell labor to business firms or other employees.<span
        id="bookmark38">‌</span><span id="bookmark39">‌</span>

          

        <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_035.jpg" width="288" height="270" alt="image" />

        <span id="bookmark40">Figure 1.6 The Circular Flow
        Diagram</span> <span class="s37">The circular flow diagram shows
        how households and firms interact in the goods and services
        market, and in the labor market. The direction of the arrows
        shows that in the goods and services market, households receive
        goods and services and pay firms for them. In the labor market,
        households provide labor and receive payment from firms through
        wages, salaries, and benefits.</span>

          

        Firms produce and sell goods and services to households in the
        market for goods and services (or product market). Arrow “A”
        indicates this. Households pay for goods and services, which
        becomes the revenues to firms. Arrow “B” indicates this. Arrows
        A and B represent the two sides of the product market. Where do
        households obtain the income to buy goods and services? They
        provide the labor and other resources (e.g. land, capital, raw
        materials) firms need to produce goods and services in the
        market for inputs (or factors of production). Arrow “C”
        indicates this. In return, firms pay for the inputs (or
        resources) they use in the form of wages and other factor
        payments. Arrow “D” indicates this. Arrows “C” and “D” represent
        the two sides of the factor market.

        Of course, in the real world, there are many different markets
        for goods and services and markets for many different types of
        labor. The circular flow diagram simplifies this to make the
        picture easier to grasp. In the diagram, firms produce goods and
        services, which they sell to households in return for revenues.
        The outer circle shows this, and represents the two sides of the
        product market (for example, the market for goods and services)
        in which households demand and firms supply. Households sell
        their labor as workers to firms in return for wages, salaries,
        and benefits. The inner circle shows this and represents the two
        sides of the labor market in which households supply and firms
        demand.

        This version of the circular flow model is stripped down to the
        essentials, but it has enough features to explain how the
        product and labor markets work in the economy. We could easily
        add details to this basic model if we wanted to introduce more
        real-world elements, like financial markets, governments, and
        interactions with the rest of the globe (imports and exports).

        Economists carry a set of theories in their heads like a
        carpenter carries around a toolkit. When they see an economic
        issue or problem, they go through the theories they know to see
        if they can find one that fits. Then they use the theory to
        derive insights about the issue or problem. Economists express
        theories as diagrams, graphs, or even as mathematical equations.
        (Do not worry. In this course, we will mostly use graphs.)
        Economists do not figure out the answer to the problem first and
        then draw the graph to illustrate. Rather, they use the graph of
        the theory to help them figure out the answer. Although at the
        introductory level, you can sometimes figure out the right
        answer without applying a model, if you keep studying economics,
        before too long you will run into issues and problems that you
        will need to graph to solve. We explain both micro and
        macroeconomics in terms of theories and models. The most
        well-known theories are probably those of supply and demand, but
        you will learn a number of others.

        style=" color: #3767B1;">How To Organize Economies: An Overview
        of Economic Systems</span><span id="bookmark41">‌</span>

        By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        -   Contrast traditional economies, command economies, and
            market economies

        -   Explain gross domestic product (GDP)

        -   Assess the importance and effects of globalization

          

        Think about what a complex system a modern economy is. It
        includes all production of goods and services, all buying and
        selling, all employment. The economic life of every individual
        is interrelated, at least to a small extent, with the economic
        lives of thousands or even millions of other individuals. Who
        organizes and coordinates this system? Who insures that, for
        example, the number of televisions a society provides is the
        same as the amount it needs and wants? Who insures that the
        right number of employees work in the electronics industry? Who
        insures that televisions are produced in the best way possible?
        How does it all get done?

        <span id="bookmark42">There are at least three ways that
        societies organize an economy. The first is the</span>
        **traditional economy**, which is the oldest economic system and
        is used in parts of Asia, Africa, and South America. Traditional
        economies organize their economic affairs the way they have
        always done (i.e., tradition). Occupations stay in the family.
        Most families are farmers who grow the crops using traditional
        methods. What you produce is what you consume. Because tradition
        drives the way of life, there is little economic progress or
        development.

        <span id="bookmark44">Command economies are very different. In
        a</span> **command
        economy**<a href="#bookmark43" class="s34">, economic effort is devoted to goals passed down from a ruler or ruling class. Ancient Egypt was a good example: a large part of economic life was devoted to building pyramids, like those in</a>
        <a href="#bookmark43" class="a">Figure</a> <span
        class="s54">1.7</span>, for the pharaohs. Medieval manor life is
        another example: the lord provided the land for growing crops
        and protection in the event of war. In return, vassals provided
        labor and soldiers to do the lord’s bidding. In the last
        century, communism emphasized command economies.

        In a command economy, the government decides what goods and
        services will be produced and what prices it will charge for
        them. The government decides what methods of production to use
        and sets wages for workers. The government provides many
        necessities like healthcare and education for free. Currently,
        Cuba and North Korea have command economies.

        class="s37">Nothing says “market” more than The New York Stock
        Exchange. (Credit: Erik Drost/ Flickr Creative Commons)</span>

          

        <span id="bookmark46">Although command economies have a very
        centralized structure for economic decisions, market economies
        have a very decentralized structure. A</span> **market**
        <a href="#bookmark45" class="s34">is an institution that brings together buyers and sellers of goods or services, who may be either individuals or businesses. The New York Stock Exchange (</a><a href="#bookmark45" class="a">Figure</a>
        <span class="s54">1.8</span>) is a prime example of a market
        which brings buyers and sellers together. In a **market
        economy**, decision-making is decentralized. Market economies
        are based on **private enterprise**: the private individuals or
        groups of private individuals own and operate the means of
        production (resources and businesses). Businesses supply goods
        and services based on demand. (In a command economy, by
        contrast, the government owns resources and businesses.) Supply
        of goods and services depends on what the demands. A person’s
        income is based on his or her ability to convert resources
        (especially labor) into something that society values. The more
        society values the person’s output, the higher the income (think
        Lady Gaga or LeBron James). In this scenario, market forces, not
        governments, determine economic decisions.<span

        What countries are considered economically free?

        Who is in control of economic decisions? Are people free to do
        what they want and to work where they want? Are businesses free
        to produce when they want and what they choose, and to hire and
        fire as they wish? Are banks free to choose who will receive
        loans, or does the government control these kinds of choices?
        Each year, researchers at the Heritage Foundation and the *Wall
        Street Journal* look at 50 different categories of economic
        freedom for countries around the world. They give each nation a
        score based on the extent of economic freedom in each category.

        <a href="#bookmark49" class="s84">The 2016 Heritage Foundation’s Index of Economic Freedom report ranked 178 countries around the world:</a>
        <a href="#bookmark49" class="s43">Table 1.1</a> <span
        class="s37">lists some examples of the most free and the least
        free countries. Several additional countries were not ranked
        because of extreme instability that made judgments about
        economic freedom impossible. These countries include
        Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Somalia, and Yemen.</span>

        The assigned rankings are inevitably based on estimates, yet
        even these rough measures can be useful for discerning trends.
        In 2015, 101 of the 178 included countries shifted toward
        greater economic freedom, although 77 of the countries shifted
        toward less economic freedom. In recent decades, the overall
        trend has been a *higher level of economic freedom around the
        world*.

        <a href="https://openstax.org/l/cato" class="s34">Most economies in the real world are mixed. They combine elements of command and market (and even traditional) systems. The U.S. economy is positioned toward the market-oriented end of the spectrum. Many countries in Europe and Latin America, while primarily market-oriented, have a greater degree of government involvement in economic decisions than the U.S. economy. China and Russia, while over the past several decades have moved more in the direction of having a market-oriented system, remain closer to the command economy end of the spectrum. The Heritage Foundation provides information about how free and thus market-oriented different countries' are, as the following Clear It Up feature discusses. For a similar ranking, but one that defines freedom more broadly, see the Cato Foundation's Human Freedom</a>

        Regulations: The Rules of the Game

        <span id="bookmark50">Markets and government regulations are
        always entangled. There is no such thing as an absolutely free
        market. Regulations always define the “rules of the game” in the
        economy. Economies that are primarily market-oriented have fewer
        regulations—ideally just enough to maintain an even playing
        field for participants. At a minimum, these laws govern matters
        like safeguarding private property against theft, protecting
        people from violence, enforcing legal contracts, preventing
        fraud, and collecting taxes. Conversely, even the most
        command-oriented economies operate using markets. How else would
        buying and selling occur? The government heavily regulates
        decisions of what to produce and prices to charge. Heavily
        regulated economies often have</span> **underground economies**
        (or black markets), which are markets where the buyers and
        sellers make transactions without the government’s approval.

        The question of how to organize economic institutions is
        typically not a black-or-white choice between all market or all
        government, but instead involves a balancing act over the
        appropriate combination of market freedom and government rules.

        The Rise of Globalization

        <span id="bookmark52">Recent decades have seen a trend
        toward</span> **globalization**, which is the expanding
        cultural, political, and economic connections between people
        around the world. One measure of this is the increased buying
        and selling of goods, services, and assets across national
        borders—in other words, international trade and financial
        capital flows.

        <a href="#bookmark51" class="s34">Globalization has occurred for a number of reasons. Improvements in shipping, as illustrated by the container ship in</a>
        <a href="#bookmark51" class="a">Figure</a> 1.9<span class="p">,
        and air cargo have driven down transportation costs. Innovations
        in computing and telecommunications have made it easier and
        cheaper to manage long-distance economic connections of
        production and sales. Many valuable products and services in the
        modern economy can take the form of information—for example:
        computer software; financial advice; travel planning; music,
        books and movies; and blueprints for designing a building. These
        products and many others can be transported over telephones and
        computer networks at ever-lower costs. Finally, international
        agreements and treaties between countries have encouraged
        greater trade.</span>

        <a href="#bookmark56" id="bookmark53" class="a">Table 1.2</a><span
        class="s54"> </span>presents one measure of globalization. It
        shows the percentage of domestic economic production that was
        exported for a selection of countries from 2010 to 2015,
        according to an entity known as The World Bank. **Exports** are
        the goods and services that one produces domestically and sells
        abroad. **Imports** are the goods and services that one produces
        abroad and then sells domestically. **Gross domestic product
        (GDP)** measures the size of total production in an economy.
        Thus, the ratio of exports divided by GDP measures what share of
        a country’s total economic production is sold in other
        countries.<span id="bookmark54">‌</span><span

        Table 1.2 The Extent of Globalization (exports/GDP)
        <a href="http://databank.worldbank.org/data/)" class="s48">(Source: http://databank.worldbank.org/data/)</a>

          

        In recent decades, the export/GDP ratio has generally risen,
        both worldwide and for the U.S. economy. Interestingly, the
        share of U.S. exports in proportion to the U.S. economy is well
        below the global average, in part because large economies like
        the United States can contain more of the division of labor
        inside their national borders. However, smaller economies like
        Belgium, Korea, and Canada need to trade across their borders
        with other countries to take full advantage of division of
        labor, specialization, and economies of scale. In this sense,
        the enormous U.S. economy is less affected by globalization than
        most other countries.

        <a href="#bookmark56" class="a">Table 1.2</a> <span
        class="p">indicates that many medium and low income countries
        around the world, like Mexico and China, have also experienced a
        surge of globalization in recent decades. If an astronaut in
        orbit could put on special glasses that make all economic
        transactions visible as brightly colored lines and look down at
        Earth, the astronaut would see the planet covered with
        connections.</span>

        Despite the rise in globalization over the last few decades, in
        recent years we've seen significant pushback against
        globalization from people across the world concerned about loss
        of jobs, loss of political sovereignty, and increased economic
        inequality. Prominent examples of this pushback include the 2016
        vote in Great Britain to exit the European Union (i.e. Brexit),
        and the election of Donald J. Trump for President of the United
        States.

        Decisions ... Decisions in the Social Media Age

        The world we live in today provides nearly instant access to a
        wealth of information. Consider that as recently as the late
        1970s, the *Farmer’s Almanac*, along with the Weather Bureau of
        the U.S. Department of Agriculture, were the primary sources
        American farmers used to determine when to plant and harvest
        their crops. Today, farmers are more likely to access, online,
        weather forecasts from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
        Administration or watch the Weather Channel. After all, knowing
        the upcoming forecast could drive when to harvest crops.
        Consequently, knowing the upcoming weather could change the
        amount of crop harvested.

        Some relatively new information forums, such as Facebook, are
        rapidly changing how information is distributed; hence,
        influencing decision making. In 2014, the Pew Research Center
        reported that 71% of online adults use Facebook. This social
        media forum posts topics ranging from the National Basketball
        Association, to celebrity singers and performers, to farmers.

        Information helps us make decisions as simple as what to wear
        today to how many reporters the media should send to cover a
        crash. Each of these decisions is an economic decision. After
        all, resources are scarce. If the media send ten reporters to
        cover an accident, they are not available to cover other stories
        or complete other tasks. Information provides the necessary
        knowledge to make the best possible decisions on how to utilize
        scarce resources. Welcome to the world of economics!

        KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY

          

        1.  <a href="#bookmark15" class="a">What Is Economics, and Why Is It</a>
            [Important?](#bookmark15)

            Economics seeks to solve the problem of scarcity, which is
            when human wants for goods and services exceed the available
            supply. A modern economy displays a division of labor, in
            which people earn income by specializing in what they
            produce and then use that income to purchase the products
            they need or want. The division of labor allows individuals
            and firms to specialize and to produce more for several
            reasons: a) It allows the agents to focus on areas of
            advantage due to natural factors and skill levels; b) It
            encourages the agents to learn and invent; c) It allows
            agents to take advantage of economies of scale. Division and
            specialization of labor only work when individuals can
            purchase what they do not produce in markets. Learning about
            economics helps you understand the major problems facing the
            world today, prepares you to be a good citizen, and helps
            you become a well-rounded thinker.

              

        2.  <a href="#bookmark27" class="a">Microeconomics and</a>
            [Macroeconomics](#bookmark27)

            Microeconomics and macroeconomics are two different
            perspectives on the economy. The microeconomic perspective
            focuses on parts of the economy: individuals, firms, and
            industries. The macroeconomic perspective looks at the
            economy as a whole, focusing on goals like growth in the
            standard of living, unemployment, and inflation.
            Macroeconomics has two types of policies for pursuing these
            goals: monetary policy and fiscal policy.

              

        3.  <a href="#bookmark32" class="a">How Economists Use Theories and Models to Understand Economic</a>
            [Issues](#bookmark32)

            Economists analyze problems differently than do other
            disciplinary experts. The main tools economists use are
            economic theories or models. A theory is not an illustration
            of the answer to a problem. Rather, a theory is a tool for
            determining the answer.

              

        4.  <a href="#bookmark41" class="a">How To Organize Economies: An Overview of Economic</a>
            [Systems](#bookmark41)

    We can organize societies as traditional, command, or
    market-oriented economies. Most societies are a mix. The last few
    decades have seen globalization evolve as a result of growth in
    commercial and financial networks that cross national borders,
    making businesses and workers from different economies increasingly
    interdependent.

        CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS

          

        1.  Suppose you have a team of two workers: one is a baker and
            one is a chef. Explain why the kitchen can produce more
            meals in a given period of time if each worker specializes
            in what they do best than if each worker tries to do
            everything from appetizer to dessert.

        2.  Why would division of labor without trade not work?

        3.  Can you think of any examples of *free* goods, that is,
            goods or services that are not scarce?

        4.  A balanced federal budget and a balance of trade are
            secondary goals of macroeconomics, while growth in the

        the economy over the past decade?

      

    1.  Macroeconomics is an aggregate of what happens at the
        microeconomic level. Would it be possible for what happens at
        the macro level to differ from how economic agents would react
        to some stimulus at the micro level? *Hint:* Think about the
        behavior of crowds.

    2.  Why is it unfair or meaningless to criticize a theory as
        “unrealistic?”

    3.  Suppose, as an economist, you are asked to analyze an issue
        unlike anything you have ever done before. Also, suppose you do
        not have a specific model for analyzing that issue. What should
        you do? *Hint:* What would a carpenter do in a similar
        situation?

    4.  Why do you think that most modern countries’ economies are a mix
        of command and market types?

    5.  Can you think of ways that globalization has helped you
        economically? Can you think of ways that it has not?

Choices ... To What Degree?

In 2015, the median income for workers who hold master's degrees varies
from males to females. The average of the two is $2,951 weekly. Multiply
this average by 52 weeks, and you get an average salary of

$153,452. Compare that to the median weekly earnings for a full-time
worker over 25 with no higher than a bachelor’s degree: $1,224 weekly
and $63,648 a year. What about those with no higher than a high school
diploma in 2015? They earn just $664 weekly and $34,528 over 12 months.
In other words, says the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), earning a
bachelor’s degree boosted salaries 54% over what you would have earned
if you had stopped your education after high school. A master’s degree
yields a salary almost double that of a high school diploma.

Given these statistics, we might expect many people to choose to go to
college and at least earn a bachelor’s degree. Assuming that people want
to improve their material well-being, it seems like they would make
those choices that provide them with the greatest opportunity to consume
goods and services. As it turns out, the analysis is not nearly as
simple as this. In fact, in 2014, the BLS reported that while almost 88%
of the population in the United States had a high school diploma, only
33.6% of 25–65 year olds had bachelor’s degrees, and only 7.4% of 25–65
year olds in 2014 had earned a master’s.

This brings us to the subject of this chapter: why people make the
choices they make and how economists explain those choices.

#### Introduction to Choice in a World of Scarcity

In this chapter, you will learn about:

-   How Individuals Make Choices Based on Their Budget Constraint

-   The Production Possibilities Frontier and Social Choices

-   Confronting Objections to the Economic Approach

  

You will learn quickly when you examine the relationship between
economics and scarcity that choices involve tradeoffs. Every choice has
a cost.

In 1968, the Rolling Stones recorded “You Can’t Always Get What You
Want.” Economists chuckled, because they had been singing a similar tune
for decades. English economist Lionel Robbins (1898–1984), in his *Essay
on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science* in 1932, described
not always getting what you want in this way:

The time at our disposal is limited. There are only twenty-four hours in
the day. We have to choose between the different uses to which they may
be put. Everywhere we turn, if we choose one thing we

must relinquish others which, in different circumstances, we would wish
not to have relinquished. Scarcity of means to satisfy given ends is an
almost ubiquitous condition of human nature.

Because people live in a world of scarcity, they cannot have all the
time, money, possessions, and experiences they wish. Neither can
society.

This chapter will continue our discussion of scarcity and the economic
way of thinking by first introducing three critical concepts:
opportunity cost, marginal decision making, and diminishing returns.
Later, it will consider whether the economic way of thinking accurately
describes either how we *make* choices and how we *should* make them.

1.  <span id="bookmark91">|</span> <span style=" color: #3767B1;">How
    Individuals Make Choices Based on Their Budget
    Constraint</span><span id="bookmark97">‌</span>

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Calculate and graph budget constraints

    -   Explain opportunity sets and opportunity costs

    -   Evaluate the law of diminishing marginal utility

    -   Explain how marginal analysis and utility influence choices

      

    <a href="#bookmark98" class="s34">Consider the typical consumer’s budget problem. Consumers have a limited amount of income to spend on the things they need and want. Suppose Alphonso has $10 in spending money each week that he can allocate between bus tickets for getting to work and the burgers that he eats for lunch. Burgers cost $2 each, and bus tickets are 50 cents each. We can see Alphonso's budget problem in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark98" class="a">Figure</a> 2.2<span
    class="p">.</span>

      

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_046.jpg" width="262" height="133" alt="image" />

    <span id="bookmark98">Figure 2.2 The Budget Constraint: Alphonso’s
    Consumption Choice Opportunity Frontier</span> <span
    class="s37">Each point on the budget constraint represents a
    combination of burgers and bus tickets whose total cost adds up to
    Alphonso’s budget of $10. The relative price of burgers and bus
    tickets determines the slope of the budget constraint. All along the
    budget set, giving up one burger means gaining four bus
    tickets.</span>

      

    The vertical axis in the figure shows burger purchases and the
    horizontal axis shows bus ticket purchases. If Alphonso spends all
    his money on burgers, he can afford five per week. ($10 per week/$2
    per burger = 5 burgers per week.) However, if he does this, he will
    not be able to afford any bus tickets. Point A in the figure shows
    the choice (zero bus tickets and five burgers). Alternatively, if
    Alphonso spends all his money on bus tickets, he can afford 20 per
    week. ($10 per week/$0.50 per bus ticket = 20 bus tickets per week.)
    Then, however, he will not be able to afford any burgers. Point F
    shows this alternative choice (20 bus tickets and zero burgers).

    <span id="bookmark99">If we connect all the points between A and F,
    we get Alphonso's</span> **budget constraint**. This indicates all
    the combination of burgers and bus tickets Alphonso can afford,
    given the price of the two goods and his budget amount.

    If Alphonso is like most people, he will choose some combination
    that includes both bus tickets and burgers. That is, he will choose
    some combination on the budget constraint that is between points A
    and F. Every point on (or inside) the constraint shows a combination
    of burgers and bus tickets that Alphonso can afford. Any point
    outside the constraint is not affordable, because it would cost more
    money than Alphonso has in his budget.

    The budget constraint clearly shows the tradeoff Alphonso faces in
    choosing between burgers and bus tickets. Suppose he is currently at
    point D, where he can afford 12 bus tickets and two burgers. What
    would it cost Alphonso for one more burger? It would be natural to
    answer $2, but that’s not the way economists think. Instead they
    ask, how many bus tickets would Alphonso have to give up to get one
    more burger, while staying within his budget? Since bus tickets cost
    50 cents, Alphonso would have to give up four to afford one more
    burger. That is the true cost to Alphonso.

    desires. The idea behind opportunity cost is that the cost of one
    item is the lost opportunity to do or consume something else. In
    short, opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative.
    For Alphonso, the opportunity cost of a burger is the four bus
    tickets he would have to give up. He would decide whether or not to
    choose the burger depending on whether the value of the burger
    exceeds the value of the forgone alternative—in this case, bus
    tickets. Since people must choose, they inevitably face tradeoffs in
    which they have to give up things they desire to obtain other things
    they desire more.

      

      

    A fundamental principle of economics is that every choice has an
    opportunity cost. If you sleep through your economics class, the
    opportunity cost is the learning you miss from not attending class.
    If you spend your income on video games, you cannot spend it on
    movies. If you choose to marry one person, you give up the
    opportunity to marry anyone else. In short, opportunity cost is all
    around us and part of human existence.

    Economics<span class="p">.</span>

      

    Understanding Budget Constraints

    <a href="#bookmark1750" class="s84">Budget constraints are easy to understand if you apply a little math. The appendix</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1750" class="s43">The Use of Mathematics in Principles of</a>
    Economics <span class="s37">explains all the math you are likely to
    need in this book. Therefore, if math is not your strength, you
    might want to take a look at the appendix.</span>

    Step 1: The equation for any budget constraint is:

    Budget = P<span class="s55">1</span><span class="s56"> </span>×
    Q<span class="s55">1</span><span class="s56"> </span>+ P<span
    class="s55">2</span><span class="s56"> </span>× Q<span
    class="s55">2</span>

    where P and Q are the price and quantity of items purchased (which
    we assume here to be two items) and Budget is the amount of income
    one has to spend.

    Step 2. Apply the budget constraint equation to the scenario. In
    Alphonso’s case, this works out to be:

    Budget = P<span class="s55">1</span><span class="s56"> </span>×
    Q<span class="s55">1</span><span class="s56"> </span>+ P<span
    class="s55">2</span><span class="s56"> </span>× Q<span
    class="s55">2</span>

    $10 budget = $2 per burger × quantity of burgers + $0.50 per bus
    ticket × quantity of bus tickets

    $10 = $2 × Q<span class="s58">burgers</span><span class="s59">
    </span>+ $0.50 × Q<span class="s58">bus</span><span class="s59">
    tickets</span>

    Step 3. Using a little algebra, we can turn this into the familiar
    equation of a line:

    y = b + mx

      

    For Alphonso, this is:

      

    $10 = $2 × Q<span class="s58">burgers</span><span class="s59">
    </span>+ $0.50 × Q<span class="s58">bus</span><span class="s59">
    tickets</span>

      

    Step 4. Simplify the equation. Begin by multiplying both sides of
    the equation by 2:

    2 × 10 = 2 × 2 × Q<span class="s55">burgers</span><span class="s56">
    </span>+ 2 × 0.5 × Q<span class="s55">bus</span><span class="s56">
    tickets</span>

    20 = 4 × Q<span class="s58">burgers</span><span class="s59">
    </span>+ 1 × Q<span class="s58">bus</span><span class="s59">
    tickets</span>

    Step 5. Subtract one bus ticket from both sides:

    20 – Q<span class="s58">bus</span><span class="s59"> tickets
    </span>= 4 × Q<span class="s58">burgers</span>

    Divide each side by 4 to yield the answer:

    5 – 0.25 × Q<span class="s58">bus</span><span class="s59"> tickets
    </span>= Q<span class="s58">burgers</span>

    or

    Q<span class="s58">burgers</span><span class="s59"> </span>= 5 –
    0.25 × Q<span class="s58">bus</span><span class="s59">
    tickets</span>

    <a href="#bookmark98" class="s84">Step 6. Notice that this equation fits the budget constraint in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark98" class="s43">Figure</a>
    2.2<a href="#bookmark101" class="s84">. The vertical intercept is 5 and the slope is –0.25, just as the equation says. If you plug 20 bus tickets into the equation, you get 0 burgers. If you plug other numbers of bus tickets into the equation, you get the results (see</a>
    <a href="#bookmark101" class="s43">Table</a> 2.1<span class="s37">),
    which are the points on Alphonso’s budget constraint.</span>

    Table 2.1

    Step 7. Notice that the slope of a budget constraint always shows
    the opportunity cost of the good which is on the horizontal axis.
    For Alphonso, the slope is −0.25, indicating that for every bus
    ticket he buys, he must give up 1/4 burger. To phrase it
    differently, for every four tickets he buys, Alphonso must give up 1
    burger.

    There are two important observations here. First, the algebraic sign
    of the slope is negative, which means that the only way to get more
    of one good is to give up some of the other. Second, we define the
    slope as the price of bus tickets (whatever is on the horizontal
    axis in the graph) divided by the price of burgers (whatever is on
    the vertical axis), in this case $0.50/$2 = 0.25. If you want to
    determine the opportunity cost quickly, just divide the two prices.

    Identifying Opportunity Cost

    <span id="bookmark102">In many cases, it is reasonable to refer to
    the opportunity cost as the price. If your cousin buys a new bicycle
    for $300, then $300 measures the amount of “other consumption” that
    he has forsaken. For practical purposes, there may be no special
    need to identify the specific alternative product or products that
    he could have bought with that $300, but sometimes the price as
    measured in dollars may not accurately capture the true opportunity
    cost. This problem can loom especially large when costs of time are
    involved.</span>

    For example, consider a boss who decides that all employees will
    attend a two-day retreat to “build team spirit.” The out-of-pocket
    monetary cost of the event may involve hiring an outside consulting
    firm to run the retreat, as well as room and board for all
    participants. However, an opportunity cost exists as well: during
    the two days of the retreat, none of the employees are doing any
    other work.

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_050.png" width="624" height="51" alt="image" />

    What is the opportunity cost associated with increased airport
    security measures?

    After the terrorist plane hijackings on September 11, 2001, many
    steps were proposed to improve air travel safety. For example, the
    federal government could provide armed “sky marshals” who would
    travel inconspicuously with the rest of the passengers. The cost of
    having a sky marshal on every flight would be roughly $3 billion per
    year. Retrofitting all U.S. planes with reinforced cockpit doors to
    make it harder for terrorists to take over the plane would have a
    price tag of $450 million. Buying more sophisticated security
    equipment for airports, like three-dimensional baggage scanners and
    cameras linked to face recognition software, could cost another $2
    billion.

    However, the single biggest cost of greater airline security does
    not involve spending money. It is the opportunity cost of additional
    waiting time at the airport. According to the United States
    Department of Transportation (DOT), there were 895.5 million
    systemwide (domestic and international) scheduled service passengers
    in 2015. Since the 9/11 hijackings, security screening has become
    more intensive, and consequently, the procedure takes longer than in
    the past. Say that, on average, each air passenger spends

    Attending college is another case where the opportunity cost exceeds
    the monetary cost. The out-of-pocket costs of attending college
    include tuition, books, room and board, and other expenses. However,
    in addition, during the hours that you are attending class and
    studying, it is impossible to work at a paying job. Thus, college
    imposes both an out-of-pocket cost and an opportunity cost of lost
    earnings.

      

      

    an extra 30 minutes in the airport per trip. Economists commonly
    place a value on time to convert an opportunity cost in time into a
    monetary figure. Because many air travelers are relatively high-paid
    business people, conservative estimates set the average price of
    time for air travelers at $20 per hour. By these back-
    of-the-envelope calculations, the opportunity cost of delays in
    airports could be as much as 800 million × 0.5 hours × $20/hour, or
    $8 billion per year. Clearly, the opportunity costs of waiting time
    can be just as important as costs that involve direct spending.

      

    In some cases, realizing the opportunity cost can alter behavior.
    Imagine, for example, that you spend $8 on lunch every day at work.
    You may know perfectly well that bringing a lunch from home would
    cost only $3 a day, so the opportunity cost of buying lunch at the
    restaurant is $5 each day (that is, the $8 buying lunch costs minus
    the $3 your lunch from home would cost). Five dollars each day does
    not seem to be that much. However, if you project what that adds up
    to in a year—250 days a year × $5 per day equals $1,250, the cost,
    perhaps, of a decent vacation. If you describe the opportunity cost
    as “a nice vacation” instead of “$5 a day,” you might make different
    choices.

    Marginal Decision-Making and Diminishing Marginal Utility

    <span id="bookmark103">The budget constraint framework helps to
    emphasize that most choices in the real world are not about getting
    all of one thing or all of another; that is, they are not about
    choosing either the point at one end of the budget constraint or
    else the point all the way at the other end. Instead, most choices
    involve</span> **marginal analysis**, which means examining the
    benefits and costs of choosing a little more or a little less of a
    good. People naturally compare costs and benefits, but often we look
    at total costs and total benefits, when the optimal choice
    necessitates comparing how costs and benefits change from one option
    to another. You might think of marginal analysis as “change
    analysis.” Marginal analysis is used throughout economics.

    <span id="bookmark104">We now turn to the notion of</span>
    **utility**<a href="http://cnx.org/content/m63895/latest/" class="s34">. People desire goods and services for the satisfaction or utility those goods and services provide. Utility, as we will see in the chapter on</a>
    <a href="http://cnx.org/content/m63895/latest/" class="a">Consumer Choices (http://cnx.org/content/m63895/ latest/)</a><span
    class="s54"> </span>, is subjective but that does not make it less
    real. Economists typically assume that the more of some good one
    consumes (for example, slices of pizza), the more utility one
    obtains. At the same time, the utility a person receives from
    consuming the first unit of a good is typically more than the
    utility received from consuming the fifth or the tenth unit of that
    same good. When Alphonso chooses between burgers and bus tickets,
    for example, the first few bus rides that he chooses might provide
    him with a great deal of utility—perhaps they help him get to a job
    interview or a doctor’s appointment. However, later bus rides might
    provide much less utility—they may only serve to kill time on a
    rainy day. Similarly, the first burger that Alphonso chooses to buy
    may be on a day when he missed breakfast and is ravenously hungry.
    However, if Alphonso has a burger every single day, the last few
    burgers may taste pretty boring. The general pattern that
    consumption of the first few units of any good tends to bring a
    higher level of utility to a person than consumption of later units
    is a common pattern. Economists refer to this pattern as the **law
    of diminishing marginal utility**, which means that as a person
    receives more of a good, the additional (or marginal) utility from
    each additional unit of the good declines. In other words, the first
    slice of pizza brings more satisfaction than the sixth.<span
    id="bookmark105">‌</span>

    The law of diminishing marginal utility explains why people and
    societies rarely make all-or-nothing choices. You would not say, “My
    favorite food is ice cream, so I will eat nothing but ice cream from
    now on.” Instead, even if you get a very high level of utility from
    your favorite food, if you ate it exclusively, the additional or
    marginal utility from those last few servings would not be very
    high. Similarly, most workers do not say: “I enjoy leisure, so I’ll
    never work.” Instead, workers recognize that even though some
    leisure is very nice, a combination of all leisure and no income is
    not so attractive. The budget constraint framework suggests that
    when people make choices in a world of scarcity, they will use
    marginal analysis and think about whether they would prefer a little
    more or a little less.

    A rational consumer would only purchase additional units of some
    product as long as the marginal utility exceeds the opportunity
    cost. Suppose Alphonso moves down his budget constraint from Point A
    to Point B to Point C and further. As he consumes more bus tickets,
    the marginal utility of bus tickets will diminish, while the
    opportunity cost, that is, the marginal utility of foregone burgers,
    will increase. Eventually, the opportunity cost will exceed the
    marginal utility of an additional bus ticket. If Alphonso is
    rational, he won’t purchase more bus tickets once the marginal
    utility just equals the opportunity cost. While we can’t (yet) say
    exactly how many bus tickets Alphonso will buy, that number is
    unlikely to be the most he can afford, 20.

    Sunk Costs

    In the budget constraint framework, all decisions involve what will
    happen next: that is, what quantities of goods will

      

      

    <span id="bookmark106">you consume, how many hours will you work, or
    how much will you save. These decisions do not look back to past
    choices. Thus, the budget constraint framework assumes that</span>
    **sunk costs**, which are costs that were incurred in the past and
    cannot be recovered, should not affect the current decision.

    Consider the case of Selena, who pays $8 to see a movie, but after
    watching the film for 30 minutes, she knows that it is truly
    terrible. Should she stay and watch the rest of the movie because
    she paid for the ticket, or should she leave? The money she spent is
    a sunk cost, and unless the theater manager is sympathetic, Selena
    will not get a refund. However, staying in the movie still means
    paying an opportunity cost in time. Her choice is whether to spend
    the next 90 minutes suffering through a cinematic disaster or to do
    something—anything—else. The lesson of sunk costs is to forget about
    the money and time that is irretrievably gone and instead to focus
    on the marginal costs and benefits of current and future options.

    For people and firms alike, dealing with sunk costs can be
    frustrating. It often means admitting an earlier error in judgment.
    Many firms, for example, find it hard to give up on a new product
    that is doing poorly because they spent so much money in creating
    and launching the product. However, the lesson of sunk costs is to
    ignore them and make decisions based on what will happen in the
    future.

    From a Model with Two Goods to One of Many Goods

    The budget constraint diagram containing just two goods, like most
    models used in this book, is not realistic. After all, in a modern
    economy people choose from thousands of goods. However, thinking
    about a model with many goods is a straightforward extension of what
    we discussed here. Instead of drawing just one budget constraint,
    showing the tradeoff between two goods, you can draw multiple budget
    constraints, showing the possible tradeoffs between many different
    pairs of goods. In more advanced classes in economics, you would use
    mathematical equations that include many possible goods and services
    that can be purchased, together with their quantities and prices,
    and show how the total spending on all goods and services is limited
    to the overall budget available. The graph with two goods that we
    presented here clearly illustrates that every choice has an
    opportunity cost, which is the point that does carry over to the
    real world.

    <span id="bookmark108">Just as individuals cannot have everything
    they want and must instead make choices, society as a whole cannot
    have everything it might want, either. This section of the chapter

    more similarities than differences between individual choice and
    social choice. As you read this section, focus on the similarities.

    resources to produce outside the PPF.</span>

    What’s the difference between a budget constraint and a PPF?

    There are two major differences between a budget constraint and a
    production possibilities frontier. The first is the fact that the
    budget constraint is a straight line. This is because its slope is
    given by the relative prices of the two goods, which from the point
    of view of an individual consumer, are fixed, so the slope doesn't
    change. In contrast, the PPF has a curved shape because of the law
    of the diminishing returns. Thus, the slope is different at various
    points on the PPF. The second major difference is the absence of
    specific numbers on the axes of the PPF. There are no specific
    numbers because we do not know the exact amount of resources this
    imaginary economy has, nor do we know how many resources it takes to
    produce healthcare and how many resources it takes to produce
    education. If this were a real world example, that data would be
    available.

    Whether or not we have specific numbers, conceptually we can measure
    the opportunity cost of additional education as society moves from
    point B to point C on the PPF. We measure the additional education
    by the horizontal distance between B and C. The foregone healthcare
    is given by the vertical distance between B and C. The slope of the
    PPF between B and C is (approximately) the vertical distance (the
    “rise”) over the horizontal distance (the “run”). This is the
    opportunity cost of the additional education.

    <span id="bookmark110">Most importantly, the production
    possibilities frontier clearly shows the tradeoff between healthcare
    and education. Suppose society has chosen to operate at point B, and
    it is considering producing more education. Because the PPF is
    downward sloping from left to right, the only way society can obtain
    more education is by giving up some healthcare. That is the tradeoff
    society faces. Suppose it considers moving from point B to point C.
    What would the opportunity cost be for the additional education? The
    opportunity cost would be the healthcare society has to forgo. Just
    as with Alphonso’s budget constraint, the</span> **slope** of the
    production possibilities frontier shows the opportunity cost. By now
    you might be saying, “Hey, this PPF is sounding like the budget
    constraint.” If so, read the following Clear It Up feature.

      

      

    The Shape of the PPF and the Law of Diminishing Returns

    <span id="bookmark111">The budget constraints that we presented
    earlier in this chapter, showing individual choices about what
    quantities of goods to consume, were all straight lines. The reason
    for these straight lines was that the relative prices of the two
    goods in the</span> **consumption budget constraint** determined the
    slope of the budget constraint. However, we drew the production
    possibilities frontier for healthcare and education as a curved
    line. Why does the PPF have a different shape?

    To understand why the PPF is curved, start by considering point A at
    the top left-hand side of the PPF. At point A, all available
    resources are devoted to healthcare and none are left for education.
    This situation would be extreme and even ridiculous. For example,
    children are seeing a doctor every day, whether they are sick or
    not, but not attending school. People are having cosmetic surgery on
    every part of their bodies, but no high school or college education
    exists. Now imagine that some of these resources are diverted from
    healthcare to education, so that the economy is at point B instead
    of point A. Diverting some resources away from A to B causes
    relatively little reduction in health because the last few marginal
    dollars going into healthcare services are not producing much
    additional gain in health. However, putting those marginal dollars
    into education, which is completely without resources at point A,
    can produce relatively large gains. For this reason, the shape of
    the PPF from A to B is relatively flat, representing a relatively
    small drop-off in health and a relatively large gain in education.

    Now consider the other end, at the lower right, of the production
    possibilities frontier. Imagine that society starts at choice D,
    which is devoting nearly all resources to education and very few to
    healthcare, and moves to point F, which is devoting *all* spending
    to education and none to healthcare. For the sake of concreteness,
    you can imagine that in the movement from D to F, the last few
    doctors must become high school science teachers, the last few
    nurses must become school librarians rather than dispensers of
    vaccinations, and the last few emergency rooms are turned into
    kindergartens. The gains to education from adding these last few
    resources to education are very small. However, the opportunity cost
    lost to health will be fairly large, and thus the slope of the PPF
    between D and F is steep, showing a large drop in health for only a
    small gain in education.

    The lesson is not that society is likely to make an extreme choice
    like devoting no resources to education at point A or no resources
    to health at point F. Instead, the lesson is that the gains from
    committing additional marginal resources to education depend on how
    much is already being spent. If on the one hand, very few resources
    are currently committed to education, then an increase in resources
    used can bring relatively large gains. On the other hand, if a large
    number of resources are already committed to education, then
    committing additional resources will bring relatively smaller gains.

    <span id="bookmark112">This pattern is common enough that economists
    have given it a name: the</span> **law of diminishing returns**,
    which holds that as additional increments of resources are added to
    a certain purpose, the marginal benefit from those additional
    increments will decline. (The law of diminishing marginal utility
    that we introduced in the last section is a more specific case of
    the law of diminishing returns.) When government spends a certain
    amount more on reducing crime, for example, the original gains in
    reducing crime could be relatively large. However, additional
    increases typically cause relatively smaller reductions in crime,
    and paying for enough police and security to reduce crime to nothing
    at all would be tremendously expensive.

    The curvature of the production possibilities frontier shows that as
    we add more resources to education, moving from left to right along
    the horizontal axis, the original gains are fairly large, but
    gradually diminish. Thus, the slope of the PPF is relatively flat.
    By contrast, as we add more resources to healthcare, moving from
    bottom to top on the vertical axis, the original gains are fairly
    large, but again gradually diminish. Thus, the slope of the PPF is
    relatively steep. In this way, the law of diminishing returns
    produces the outward-bending shape of the production possibilities
    frontier.

    Productive Efficiency and Allocative Efficiency

    <span id="bookmark113">The study of economics does not presume to
    tell a society what choice it should make along its production
    possibilities frontier. In a market-oriented economy with a
    democratic government, the choice will involve a mixture of
    decisions by individuals, firms, and government. However, economics
    can point out that some choices are unambiguously better than
    others. This observation is based on the concept of efficiency. In
    everyday usage, efficiency refers to lack of waste. An inefficient
    machine operates at high cost, while an efficient machine operates
    at lower cost, because it is not wasting energy or materials. An
    inefficient organization operates with long delays and high costs,
    while an efficient organization meets schedules, is focused, and
    performs within budget.</span>

    <a href="#bookmark114" class="s34">The production possibilities frontier can illustrate two kinds of efficiency: productive efficiency and allocative efficiency.</a>
    <a href="#bookmark114" class="a">Figure</a> 2.4 <span
    class="p">illustrates these ideas using a production possibilities
    frontier between healthcare and</span>

      

      

    education.

      

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_053.jpg" width="224" height="224" alt="image" />

      

    <span id="bookmark114">Figure 2.4 Productive and Allocative
    Efficiency</span> <span class="s37">Productive efficiency means it
    is impossible to produce more of one good without decreasing the
    quantity that is produced of another good. Thus, all choices along a
    given PPF like B, C, and D display productive efficiency, but R does
    not. Allocative efficiency means that the particular mix of goods
    being produced—that is, the specific choice along the production
    possibilities frontier—represents the allocation that society most
    desires.</span>

      

    <span id="bookmark115">Productive efficiency</span>
    <a href="#bookmark114" class="s34">means that, given the available inputs and technology, it is impossible to produce more of one good without decreasing the quantity that is produced of another good. All choices on the PPF in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark114" class="a">Figure</a> <span
    class="s54">2.4</span><span class="p">, including A, B, C, D, and F,
    display productive efficiency. As a firm moves from any one of these
    choices to any other, either healthcare increases and education
    decreases or vice versa. However, any choice inside the production
    possibilities frontier is productively inefficient and wasteful
    because it is possible to produce more of one good, the other good,
    or some combination of both goods.</span>

    For example, point R is productively inefficient because it is
    possible at choice C to have more of both goods: education on the
    horizontal axis is higher at point C than point R (E<span
    class="s60">2</span> is greater than E<span class="s60">1</span>),
    and healthcare on the vertical axis is also higher at point C than
    point R (H<span class="s60">2</span> is great than H<span
    class="s60">1</span>).

    We can show the particular mix of goods and services produced—that
    is, the specific combination of selected healthcare and education
    along the production possibilities frontier—as a ray (line) from the
    origin to a specific point on the PPF. Output mixes that had more
    healthcare (and less education) would have a steeper ray, while
    those with more education (and less healthcare) would have a flatter
    ray.

    <span id="bookmark116">Allocative efficiency</span> <span
    class="p">means that the particular combination of goods and
    services on the production possibility curve that a society produces
    represents the combination that society most desires. How to
    determine what a society desires can be a controversial question,
    and is usually a discussion in political science, sociology, and
    philosophy classes as well as in economics. At its most basic,
    allocative efficiency means producers supply the quantity of each
    product that consumers demand. Only one of the productively
    efficient choices will be the allocatively efficient choice for
    society as a whole.</span>

    Why Society Must Choose

    <a href="#bookmark14" class="s34">In</a>
    <a href="#bookmark14" class="a">Welcome to Economics!</a> <span
    class="p">we learned that every society faces the problem of
    scarcity, where limited resources conflict with unlimited needs and
    wants. The production possibilities curve illustrates the choices
    involved in this dilemma.</span>

    Every economy faces two situations in which it may be able to expand
    consumption of all goods. In the first case, a society may discover
    that it has been using its resources inefficiently, in which case by
    improving efficiency and producing on the production possibilities
    frontier, it can have more of all goods (or at least more of some
    and less of none). In the second case, as resources grow over a
    period of years (e.g., more labor and more capital), the economy
    grows. As it does, the production possibilities frontier for a
    society will tend to shift outward and society will be able to
    afford more of all goods.

      

      

    <span id="bookmark117">However, improvements in productive
    efficiency take time to discover and implement, and economic growth
    happens only gradually. Thus, a society must choose between
    tradeoffs in the present. For government, this process often
    involves trying to identify where additional spending could do the
    most good and where reductions in spending would do the least harm.
    At the individual and firm level, the market economy coordinates a
    process in which firms seek to produce goods and services in the
    quantity, quality, and price that people want. However, for both the
    government and the market economy in the short term, increases in
    production of one good typically mean offsetting decreases somewhere
    else in the economy.</span>

    The PPF and Comparative Advantage

    While every society must choose how much of each good or service it
    should produce, it does not need to produce every single good it
    consumes. Often how much of a good a country decides to produce
    depends on how expensive it is to produce it versus buying it from a
    different country. As we saw earlier, the curvature of a country’s
    PPF gives us information about the tradeoff between devoting
    resources to producing one good versus another. In particular, its
    slope gives the opportunity cost of producing one more unit of the
    good in the x-axis in terms of the other good (in the y-axis).
    Countries tend to have different opportunity costs of producing a
    specific good, either because of different climates, geography,
    technology, or skills.

    <a href="#bookmark118" class="s34">Suppose two countries, the US and Brazil, need to decide how much they will produce of two crops: sugar cane and wheat. Due to its climatic conditions, Brazil can produce quite a bit of sugar cane per acre but not much wheat. Conversely, the U.S. can produce large amounts of wheat per acre, but not much sugar cane. Clearly, Brazil has a lower opportunity cost of producing sugar cane (in terms of wheat) than the U.S. The reverse is also true: the U.S. has a lower opportunity cost of producing wheat than Brazil. We illustrate this by the PPFs of the two countries in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark118" class="a">Figure</a> 2.5<span
    class="p">.</span>

      

      

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_054.jpg" width="608" height="307" alt="image" />

    <span id="bookmark118">Figure 2.5 Production Possibility Frontier
    for the U.S. and Brazil</span> <span class="s37">The U.S. PPF is
    flatter than the Brazil PPF implying that the opportunity cost of
    wheat in terms of sugar cane is lower in the U.S. than in Brazil.
    Conversely, the opportunity cost of sugar cane is lower in Brazil.
    The U.S. has comparative advantage in wheat and Brazil has
    comparative advantage in sugar cane.</span>

      

    <span id="bookmark119">When a country can produce a good at a lower
    opportunity cost than another country, we say that this country has
    a</span> **comparative advantage** in that good. Comparative
    advantage is not the same as absolute advantage, which is when a
    country can produce more of a good. Comparative advantage is not the
    same as absolute advantage, which is when a country can produce more
    of a good. In our example, Brazil has an absolute advantage in sugar
    cane and the U.S. has an absolute advantage in wheat. One can easily
    see this with a simple observation of the extreme production points
    in the PPFs of the two countries. If Brazil devoted all of its
    resources to producing wheat, it would be producing at point

    A. If however it had devoted all of its resources to producing sugar
    cane instead, it would be producing a much larger

      

    amount than the U.S., at point B.

    <a href="#bookmark1593" class="s34">The slope of the PPF gives the opportunity cost of producing an additional unit of wheat. While the slope is not constant throughout the PPFs, it is quite apparent that the PPF in Brazil is much steeper than in the U.S., and therefore the opportunity cost of wheat generally higher in Brazil. In the chapter on</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1593" class="a">International Trade</a> <span
    class="p">you will learn that countries’ differences in comparative
    advantage determine which goods they will choose to produce and
    trade. When countries engage in trade, they specialize in the
    production of the goods in which they have comparative advantage,
    and trade part of that production for goods in which they do not
    have comparative advantage. With trade, manufacturers produce goods
    where the opportunity cost is lowest, so total production increases,
    benefiting both trading parties.</span>

      

3.  <span id="bookmark93">|</span> <span
    style=" color: #3767B1;">Confronting Objections to the Economic
    Approach</span><span id="bookmark120">‌</span>

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Analyze arguments against economic approaches to decision-making

    -   Interpret a tradeoff diagram

    -   Contrast normative statements and positive statements

      

    It is one thing to understand the economic approach to
    decision-making and another thing to feel comfortable applying it.
    The sources of discomfort typically fall into two categories: that
    people do not act in the way that fits the economic way of thinking,
    and that even if people did act that way, they should try not to.
    Let’s consider these arguments in turn.

    First Objection: People, Firms, and Society Do Not Act Like This

    The economic approach to decision-making seems to require more
    information than most individuals possess and more careful
    decision-making than most individuals actually display. After all,
    do you or any of your friends draw a budget constraint and mutter to
    yourself about maximizing utility before you head to the shopping
    mall? Do members of the U.S. Congress contemplate production
    possibilities frontiers before they vote on the annual budget? The
    messy ways in which people and societies operate somehow doesn’t
    look much like neat budget constraints or smoothly curving
    production possibilities frontiers.

    However, the economics approach can be a useful way to analyze and
    understand the tradeoffs of economic decisions. To appreciate this
    point, imagine for a moment that you are playing basketball,
    dribbling to the right, and throwing a bounce-pass to the left to a
    teammate who is running toward the basket. A physicist or engineer
    could work out the correct speed and trajectory for the pass, given
    the different movements involved and the weight and bounciness of
    the ball. However, when you are playing basketball, you do not
    perform any of these calculations. You just pass the ball, and if
    you are a good player, you will do so with high accuracy.

    Someone might argue: “The scientist’s formula of the bounce-pass
    requires a far greater knowledge of physics and far more specific
    information about speeds of movement and weights than the basketball
    player actually has, so it must be an unrealistic description of how
    basketball passes actually occur.” This reaction would be
    wrongheaded. The fact that a good player can throw the ball
    accurately because of practice and skill, without making a physics
    calculation, does not mean that the physics calculation is wrong.

    <a href="http://cnx.org/content/m63895/latest/" class="s34">Similarly, from an economic point of view, someone who shops for groceries every week has a great deal of practice with how to purchase the combination of goods that will provide that person with utility, even if the shopper does not phrase decisions in terms of a budget constraint. Government institutions may work imperfectly and slowly, but in general, a democratic form of government feels pressure from voters and social institutions to make the choices that are most widely preferred by people in that society. Thus, when thinking about the economic actions of groups of people, firms, and society, it is reasonable, as a first approximation, to analyze them with the tools of economic analysis. For more on this, read about behavioral economics in the chapter on</a>
    <a href="http://cnx.org/content/m63895/latest/" class="a">Consumer Choices</a>
    (http://cnx.org/content/m63895/latest/) <span class="p">.</span>

    Second Objection: People, Firms, and Society Should Not Act This Way

    The economics approach portrays people as self-interested. For some
    critics of this approach, even if self-interest is an accurate
    description of how people behave, these behaviors are not moral.
    Instead, the critics argue that people

      

      

    should be taught to care more deeply about others. Economists offer
    several answers to these concerns.

    <span id="bookmark121">First, economics is not a form of moral
    instruction. Rather, it seeks to describe economic behavior as it
    actually exists. Philosophers draw a distinction between</span>
    **positive statements**, which describe the world as it is, and
    **normative statements**, which describe how the world should be.
    Positive statements are factual. They may be true or false, but we
    can test them, at least in principle. Normative statements are
    subjective questions of opinion. We cannot test them since we cannot
    prove opinions to be true or false. They just are opinions based on
    one's values. For example, an economist could analyze a proposed
    subway system in a certain city. If the expected benefits exceed the
    costs, he concludes that the project is worthy—an example of
    positive analysis. Another economist argues for extended
    unemployment compensation during the Great Depression because a rich
    country like the United States should take care of its less
    fortunate citizens—an example of normative analysis.

    <span id="bookmark122">Even if the line between positive and
    normative statements is not always crystal clear, economic analysis
    does try to remain rooted in the study of the actual people who
    inhabit the actual economy. Fortunately however, the assumption that
    individuals are purely self-interested is a simplification about
    human nature. In fact, we need to look no further than to Adam
    Smith, the very father of modern economics to find evidence of this.
    The opening sentence of his book,</span> *The Theory of Moral
    Sentiments*, puts it very clearly: “How selfish soever man may be
    supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which
    interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness
    necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it except the
    pleasure of seeing it.” Clearly, individuals are both
    self-interested and altruistic.

    Is a diagram by any other name the same?

    When you study economics, you may feel buried under an avalanche of
    diagrams. Your goal should be to recognize the common underlying
    logic and pattern of the diagrams, not to memorize each one.

    <a href="#bookmark126" class="s84">This chapter uses only one basic diagram, although we present it with different sets of labels. The consumption budget constraint and the production possibilities frontier for society, as a whole, are the same basic diagram.</a>
    Figure 2.6 <span class="s37">shows an individual budget constraint
    and a production possibilities frontier for two goods, Good 1 and
    Good 2. The tradeoff diagram always illustrates three basic themes:
    scarcity, tradeoffs, and economic efficiency.</span>

    <span id="bookmark123">The first theme is scarcity. It is not
    feasible to have unlimited amounts of both goods. Even if the budget
    constraint or a PPF shifts, scarcity remains—just at a different
    level. The second theme is tradeoffs. As depicted in the budget
    constraint or the production possibilities frontier, it is necessary
    to forgo some of one good to gain more of the other good. The
    details of this tradeoff vary. In a budget constraint we determine,
    the tradeoff is determined by the relative prices of the goods: that
    is, the relative price of two goods in the consumption choice budget
    constraint. These tradeoffs appear as a straight line. However, a
    curved line represents the tradeoffs in many production
    possibilities frontiers because the law of diminishing returns holds
    that as we add resources to an area, the marginal gains tend to
    diminish. Regardless of the specific shape, tradeoffs
    remain.</span><span id="bookmark124">‌</span>

    <span id="bookmark125">The third theme is economic efficiency, or
    getting the most benefit from scarce resources. All choices on the
    production possibilities frontier show productive efficiency because
    in such cases, there is no way to increase the quantity of one good
    without decreasing the quantity of the other. Similarly, when an
    individual makes a</span>

    Second, we can label self-interested behavior and profit-seeking
    with other names, such as personal choice and freedom. The ability
    to make personal choices about buying, working, and saving is an
    important personal freedom. Some people may choose high-pressure,
    high-paying jobs so that they can earn and spend considerable
    amounts of money on themselves. Others may allocate large portions
    of their earnings to charity or spend it on their friends and
    family. Others may devote themselves to a career that can require
    much time, energy, and expertise but does not offer high financial
    rewards, like being an elementary school teacher or a social worker.
    Still others may choose a job that does consume much of their time
    or provide a high level of income, but still leaves time for family,
    friends, and contemplation. Some people may prefer to work for a
    large company; others might want to start their own business.
    People’s freedom to make their own economic choices has a moral
    value worth respecting.

    choice along a budget constraint, there is no way to increase the
    quantity of one good without decreasing the quantity of the other.
    The choice on a production possibilities set that is socially
    preferred, or the choice on an individual’s budget constraint that
    is personally preferred, will display allocative efficiency.

    The basic budget constraint/production possibilities frontier
    diagram will recur throughout this book. Some examples include using
    these tradeoff diagrams to analyze trade, environmental protection
    and economic output, equality of incomes and economic output, and
    the macroeconomic tradeoff between consumption and investment. Do
    not allow the different labels to confuse you. The budget
    constraint/production possibilities frontier diagram is always just
    a tool for thinking carefully about scarcity, tradeoffs, and
    efficiency in a particular situation.

      

    Figure 2.6 The Tradeoff Diagram <span class="s37">Both the
    individual opportunity set (or budget constraint) and the social
    production possibilities frontier show the constraints under which
    individual consumers and society as a whole operate. Both diagrams
    show the tradeoff in choosing more of one good at the cost of less
    of the other.</span>

    <span id="bookmark126">Third, self-interested behavior can lead to
    positive social results. For example, when people work hard to make
    a living, they create economic output. Consumers who are looking for
    the best deals will encourage businesses to offer goods and services
    that meet their needs. Adam Smith, writing in</span> *The Wealth of
    Nations*, named this property the **invisible hand**. In describing
    how consumers and producers interact in a market economy, Smith
    wrote:<span id="bookmark127">‌</span>

    Every individual…generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the
    public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By
    preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he
    intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in
    such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he
    intends only his own gain. And he is in this, as in many other
    cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part
    of his intention…By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes
    that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to
    promote it.

    The metaphor of the invisible hand suggests the remarkable
    possibility that broader social good can emerge from selfish
    individual actions.

    Fourth, even people who focus on their own self-interest in the
    economic part of their life often set aside their own narrow
    self-interest in other parts of life. For example, you might focus
    on your own self-interest when asking your employer for a raise or
    negotiating to buy a car. Then you might turn around and focus on
    other people when you volunteer to read stories at the local
    library, help a friend move to a new apartment, or donate money to a
    charity. Self- interest is a reasonable starting point for analyzing
    many economic decisions, without needing to imply that people never
    do anything that is not in their own immediate self-interest.

    Choices ... To What Degree?

    What have we learned? We know that scarcity impacts all the choices
    we make. An economist might argue that people do not obtain a
    bachelor’s or master’s degree because they do not have the resources
    to make those choices or because their incomes are too low and/or
    the price of these degrees is too high. A bachelor’s or a master’s
    degree may not be available in their opportunity set.

    The price of these degrees may be too high not only because the
    actual price, college tuition (and perhaps room and board), is too
    high. An economist might also say that for many people, the full
    opportunity cost of a bachelor’s or a master’s degree is too high.
    For these people, they are unwilling or unable to make the tradeoff
    of forfeiting years of working, and earning an income, to earn a
    degree.

    <span id="bookmark128">Finally, the statistics we introduced at the
    start of the chapter reveal information about intertemporal choices.
    An economist might say that people choose not to obtain a college
    degree because they may have to borrow money to attend college, and
    the interest they have to pay on that loan in the future will affect
    their decisions today. Also, it could be that some people have a
    preference for current consumption over future consumption, so they
    choose to work now at a lower salary and consume now, rather than
    postponing that consumption until after they graduate
    college.</span>

    KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY

      

    1.  <a href="#bookmark97" class="a">How Individuals Make Choices Based on Their Budget</a>
        [Constraint](#bookmark97)

        Economists see the real world as one of scarcity: that is, a
        world in which people’s desires exceed what is possible. As a
        result, economic behavior involves tradeoffs in which
        individuals, firms, and society must forgo something that they
        desire to obtain things that they desire more. Individuals face
        the tradeoff of what quantities of goods and services to
        consume. The budget constraint, which is the frontier of the
        opportunity set, illustrates the range of available choices. The
        relative price of the choices determines the slope of the budget
        constraint. Choices beyond the budget constraint are not
        affordable.

        Opportunity cost measures cost by what we forgo in exchange.
        Sometimes we can measure opportunity cost in money, but it is
        often useful to consider time as well, or to measure it in terms
        of the actual resources that we must forfeit.

        Most economic decisions and tradeoffs are not all-or-nothing.
        Instead, they involve marginal analysis, which means they are
        about decisions on the margin, involving a little more or a
        little less. The law of diminishing marginal utility points out
        that as a person receives more of something—whether it is a
        specific good or another resource—the

          

          

        additional marginal gains tend to become smaller. Because sunk
        costs occurred in the past and cannot be recovered, they should
        be disregarded in making current decisions.

          

    2.  <a href="#bookmark107" class="a">The Production Possibilities Frontier and Social</a>
        [Choices](#bookmark107)

        A production possibilities frontier defines the set of choices
        society faces for the combinations of goods and services it can
        produce given the resources available. The shape of the PPF is
        typically curved outward, rather than straight. Choices outside
        the PPF are unattainable and choices inside the PPF are
        wasteful. Over time, a growing economy will tend to shift the
        PPF outwards.

        The law of diminishing returns holds that as increments of
        additional resources are devoted to producing something, the
        marginal increase in output will become increasingly smaller.
        All choices along a production possibilities frontier display
        productive efficiency; that is, it is impossible to use
        society’s resources to produce more of one good without
        decreasing production of the other good. The specific choice
        along a production possibilities frontier that reflects the mix
        of goods society prefers is the choice with allocative
        efficiency. The curvature of the PPF is likely to differ by
        country, which results in different countries having comparative
        advantage in different goods. Total production can increase if
        countries specialize in the goods in which they have comparative
        advantage and trade some of their production for the remaining
        goods.

          

    3.  <a href="#bookmark120" class="a">Confronting Objections to the Economic</a>
        [Approach](#bookmark120)

The economic way of thinking provides a useful approach to understanding
human behavior. Economists make the careful distinction between positive
statements, which describe the world as it is, and normative statements,
which describe how the world should be. Even when economics analyzes the
gains and losses from various events or policies, and thus draws
normative conclusions about how the world should be, the analysis of
economics is rooted in a positive analysis of how people, firms, and
governments actually behave, not how they should behave.

    REVIEW QUESTIONS

      

8.  Explain why scarcity leads to tradeoffs.

9.  Explain why individuals make choices that are directly on the budget
    constraint, rather than inside the budget constraint or outside it.

10. What is comparative advantage?

11. What does a production possibilities frontier illustrate?

      

12. Why is a production possibilities frontier typically drawn as a
    curve, rather than a straight line?

13. Explain why societies cannot make a choice above their production
    possibilities frontier and should not make a choice below it.

14. What are diminishing marginal returns?

15. What is productive efficiency? Allocative efficiency?

      

    CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS

      

    1.  Suppose Alphonso’s town raises the price of bus tickets from
        $0.50 to $1 and the price of burgers rises from $2 to $4. Why is
        the opportunity cost of bus tickets unchanged? Suppose
        Alphonso’s weekly spending money increases from $10 to $20. How
        is his budget constraint affected from all three changes?
        Explain.

    2.  During the Second World War, Germany’s factories were decimated.
        It also suffered many human casualties, both soldiers and
        civilians. How did the war affect Germany’s production
        possibilities curve?

16. What is the difference between a positive and a normative statement?

17. Is the economic model of decision-making intended as a literal
    description of how individuals, firms, and the governments actually
    make decisions?

18. What are four responses to the claim that people should not behave
    in the way described in this chapter?

  

1.  It is clear that productive inefficiency is a waste since resources
    are used in a way that produces less goods and services than a
    nation is capable of. Why is allocative inefficiency also wasteful?

2.  What assumptions about the economy must be true for the invisible
    hand to work? To what extent are those assumptions valid in the real
    world?

3.  Do economists have any particular expertise at making normative
    arguments? In other words, they have expertise at making positive
    statements (i.e., what *will* happen) about some economic policy,
    for example, but do they have special expertise to judge whether or
    not the policy *should* be undertaken?

    magazines she could buy in a week?

5.  If the price of a pie is $12, what is the maximum number of pies she
    could buy in a week?

      

6.  Draw Marie’s budget constraint with pies on the horizontal axis and

Why Can We Not Get Enough of Organic?

Organic food is increasingly popular, not just in the United States, but
worldwide. At one time, consumers had to go to specialty stores or
farmers' markets to find organic produce. Now it is available in most
grocery stores. In short, organic is part of the mainstream.

Ever wonder why organic food costs more than conventional food? Why,
say, does an organic Fuji apple cost

$1.99 a pound, while its conventional counterpart costs $1.49 a pound?
The same price relationship is true for just about every organic product
on the market. If many organic foods are locally grown, would they not
take less time to get to market and therefore be cheaper? What are the
forces that keep those prices from coming down? Turns out those forces
have quite a bit to do with this chapter’s topic: demand and supply.

purchased for their ties to celebrities. These examples represent an
interesting facet of demand and supply.</span>

An auction bidder pays thousands of dollars for a dress Whitney Houston
wore. A collector spends a small fortune for a few drawings by John
Lennon. People usually react to purchases like these in two ways: their
jaw drops because they think these are high prices to pay for such goods
or they think these are rare, desirable items and the amount paid seems
right.

  

  

When economists talk about prices, they are less interested in making
judgments than in gaining a practical understanding of what determines
prices and why prices change. Consider a price most of us contend with
weekly: that of a gallon of gas. Why was the average price of gasoline
in the United States $3.71 per gallon in June 2014? Why did the price
for gasoline fall sharply to $1.96 per gallon by January 2016? To
explain these price movements, economists focus on the determinants of
what gasoline buyers are willing to pay and what gasoline sellers are
willing to accept.

As it turns out, the price of gasoline in June of any given year is
nearly always higher than the price in January of that same year. Over
recent decades, gasoline prices in midsummer have averaged about 10
cents per gallon more than their midwinter low. The likely reason is
that people drive more in the summer, and are also willing to pay more
for gas, but that does not explain how steeply gas prices fell. Other
factors were at work during those 18 months, such as increases in supply
and decreases in the demand for crude oil.

This chapter introduces the economic model of demand and supply—one of
the most powerful models in all of economics. The discussion here begins
by examining how demand and supply determine the price and the quantity
sold in markets for goods and services, and how changes in demand and
supply lead to changes in prices and quantities.

    style=" color: #3767B1;">Demand, Supply, and Equilibrium in Markets
    for Goods and Services</span><span id="bookmark160">‌</span>

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Explain demand, quantity demanded, and the law of demand

    -   Identify a demand curve and a supply curve

    -   Explain supply, quantity supplied, and the law of supply

    -   Explain equilibrium, equilibrium price, and equilibrium quantity

      

    First let’s first focus on what economists mean by demand, what they
    mean by supply, and then how demand and supply interact in a market.

      

    Demand for Goods and Services

    <span id="bookmark161">Economists use the term</span> **demand** to
    refer to the amount of some good or service consumers are willing
    and able to purchase at each price. Demand is fundamentally based on
    needs and wants—if you have no need or want for something, you won't
    buy it. While a consumer may be able to differentiate between a need
    and a want, but from an economist’s perspective they are the same
    thing. Demand is also based on ability to pay. If you cannot pay for
    it, you have no effective demand. By this definition, a homeless
    person probably has no effective demand for shelter.

    <span id="bookmark162">What a buyer pays for a unit of the specific
    good or service is called</span> **price**. The total number of
    units that consumers would purchase at that price is called the
    **quantity demanded**. A rise in price of a good or service almost
    always decreases the quantity demanded of that good or service.
    Conversely, a fall in price will increase the quantity demanded.
    When the price of a gallon of gasoline increases, for example,
    people look for ways to reduce their consumption by combining
    several errands, commuting by carpool or mass transit, or taking
    weekend or vacation trips closer to home. Economists call this
    inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded the **law
    of demand**. The law of demand assumes that all other variables that
    affect demand (which we explain in the next module) are held
    constant.<span id="bookmark163">‌</span><span
    id="bookmark164">‌</span>

    <a href="#bookmark167" id="bookmark165" class="s34">We can show an example from the market for gasoline in a table or a graph. Economist call a table that shows the quantity demanded at each price, such as</a>
    <a href="#bookmark167" class="a">Table</a> <span
    class="s54">3.1</span>, a **demand schedule**. In this case we
    measure price in dollars per gallon of gasoline. We measure the
    quantity demanded in millions of gallons over some time period (for
    example, per day or per year) and over some geographic area (like a
    state or a country). A **demand curve**
    <a href="#bookmark168" class="s34">shows the relationship between price and quantity demanded on a graph like</a>
    <a href="#bookmark168" class="a">Figure</a> <span
    class="s54">3.2</span>, with quantity on the horizontal axis and the
    price per gallon on the vertical axis. (Note that this is an
    exception to the normal rule in mathematics that the independent
    variable (x) goes on the horizontal axis and the dependent
    variable (y) goes on the vertical. Economics is not math.)<span

    <span class="s37">The demand schedule shows that as price rises,
    quantity demanded decreases, and vice versa. We graph these points,
    and the line connecting them is the demand curve (D). The downward
    slope of the demand curve again illustrates the law of demand—the
    inverse relationship between prices and quantity demanded.</span>

      

    Demand curves will appear somewhat different for each product. They
    may appear relatively steep or flat, or they may be straight or
    curved. Nearly all demand curves share the fundamental similarity
    that they slope down from left to right. Demand curves embody the
    law of demand: As the price increases, the quantity demanded
    decreases, and conversely, as the price decreases, the quantity
    demanded increases.

    Is demand the same as quantity demanded?

    In economic terminology, demand is not the same as quantity
    demanded. When economists talk about demand, they mean the
    relationship between a range of prices and the quantities demanded
    at those prices, as illustrated by a demand curve or a demand
    schedule. When economists talk about quantity demanded, they mean
    only a certain point on the demand curve, or one quantity on the
    demand schedule. In short, demand refers to the curve and quantity
    demanded refers to the (specific) point on the curve.

    Supply of Goods and Services

    <span id="bookmark169">When economists talk about</span> **supply**,
    they mean the amount of some good or service a producer is willing
    to supply at each price. Price is what the producer receives for
    selling one unit of a good or service. A rise in price almost always
    leads to an increase in the **quantity supplied** of that good or
    service, while a fall in price will decrease the quantity supplied.
    When the price of gasoline rises, for example, it encourages
    profit-seeking firms to take several actions: expand exploration for
    oil reserves; drill for more oil; invest in more pipelines and oil
    tankers to bring the oil to plants for refining into gasoline; build
    new oil refineries; purchase additional pipelines and trucks to ship
    the gasoline to gas stations; and open more gas stations or keep
    existing gas stations open longer hours. Economists call this
    positive relationship between price and quantity supplied—that a
    higher price leads to a higher quantity supplied and a lower price
    leads to a lower quantity supplied—the **law of supply**. The law of
    supply assumes that all other variables that affect supply (to be
    explained in the next module) are held constant.<span

    In economic terminology, supply is not the same as quantity
    supplied. When economists refer to supply, they mean the
    relationship between a range of prices and the quantities supplied
    at those prices, a relationship that we can illustrate with a supply
    curve or a supply schedule. When economists refer to quantity
    supplied, they mean only a certain point on the supply curve, or one
    quantity on the supply schedule. In short, supply refers to the
    curve and quantity supplied refers to the (specific) point on the
    curve.

    <a href="#bookmark175" id="bookmark173" class="a">Figure 3.3</a><span
    class="s54"> </span>illustrates the law of supply, again using the
    market for gasoline as an example. Like demand, we can illustrate
    supply using a table or a graph. A **supply schedule**
    <a href="#bookmark176" class="s34">is a table, like</a>
    <a href="#bookmark176" class="a">Table</a> <span
    class="s54">3.2</span>, that shows the quantity supplied at a range
    of different prices. Again, we measure price in dollars per gallon
    of gasoline and we measure quantity supplied in millions of gallons.
    A **supply curve** is a graphic illustration of the relationship
    between price, shown on the vertical axis, and quantity, shown on
    the horizontal axis. The supply schedule and the supply curve are
    just two different ways of showing the same information. Notice that
    the horizontal and vertical axes on the graph for the supply curve
    are the same as for the demand curve.<span id="bookmark174">‌</span>

    <span class="s37">The supply schedule is the table that shows
    quantity supplied of gasoline at each price. As price rises,
    quantity supplied also increases, and vice versa. The supply
    curve (S) is created by graphing the points from the supply schedule
    and then connecting them. The upward slope of the supply curve
    illustrates the law of supply—that a higher price leads to a higher
    quantity supplied, and vice versa.</span>

    Table 3.2 Price and Supply of Gasoline

      

    The shape of supply curves will vary somewhat according to the
    product: steeper, flatter, straighter, or curved. Nearly all supply
    curves, however, share a basic similarity: they slope up from left
    to right and illustrate the law of supply: as the price rises, say,
    from $1.00 per gallon to $2.20 per gallon, the quantity supplied
    increases from 500 gallons to 720 gallons. Conversely, as the price
    falls, the quantity supplied decreases.

    Equilibrium—Where Demand and Supply Intersect

    Because the graphs for demand and supply curves both have price on
    the vertical axis and quantity on the horizontal axis, the demand
    curve and supply curve for a particular good or service can appear
    on the same graph. Together, demand and supply determine the price
    and the quantity that will be bought and sold in a market.

    <a href="#bookmark177" id="bookmark179" class="s34">Remember this: When two lines on a diagram cross, this intersection usually means something. The point where the supply curve (S) and the demand curve (D) cross, designated by point E in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark177" class="a">Figure</a> <span
    class="s54">3.4</span>, is called the **equilibrium**. The
    **equilibrium price** is the only price where the plans of consumers
    and the plans of producers agree—that is, where the amount of the
    product consumers want to buy (quantity demanded) is equal to the
    amount producers want to sell (quantity supplied). Economists call
    this common quantity the **equilibrium quantity**. At any other
    price, the quantity demanded does not equal the quantity supplied,
    so the market is not in equilibrium at that price.<span
    id="bookmark180">‌</span><span id="bookmark181">‌</span>

    <a href="#bookmark177" class="s34">In</a>
    <a href="#bookmark177" class="a">Figure</a> 3.4<span class="p">, the
    equilibrium price is $1.40 per gallon of gasoline and the
    equilibrium quantity is 600 million gallons. If you had only the
    demand and supply schedules, and not the graph, you could find the
    equilibrium by looking for the price level on the tables where the
    quantity demanded and the quantity supplied are equal.</span>

    The word “equilibrium” means “balance.” If a market is at its
    equilibrium price and quantity, then it has no reason to move away
    from that point. However, if a market is not at equilibrium, then
    economic pressures arise to move the market toward the equilibrium
    price and the equilibrium quantity.

    <a href="#bookmark177" class="s34">Imagine, for example, that the price of a gallon of gasoline was above the equilibrium price—that is, instead of $1.40 per gallon, the price is $1.80 per gallon. The dashed horizontal line at the price of $1.80 in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark177" class="a">Figure 3.4</a> <span
    class="p">illustrates this above equilibrium price. At this higher
    price, the quantity demanded drops from 600 to 500. This decline in
    quantity reflects how consumers react to the higher price by finding
    ways to use less gasoline.</span>

    <span id="bookmark182">Moreover, at this higher price of $1.80, the
    quantity of gasoline supplied rises from the 600 to 680, as the
    higher price makes it more profitable for gasoline producers to
    expand their output. Now, consider how quantity demanded and
    quantity supplied are related at this above-equilibrium price.
    Quantity demanded has fallen to 500 gallons, while quantity supplied
    has risen to 680 gallons. In fact, at any above-equilibrium price,
    the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded. We call this
    an</span> **excess supply** or a **surplus**.

    With a surplus, gasoline accumulates at gas stations, in tanker
    trucks, in pipelines, and at oil refineries. This accumulation puts
    pressure on gasoline sellers. If a surplus remains unsold, those
    firms involved in making and selling gasoline are not receiving
    enough cash to pay their workers and to cover their expenses. In
    this situation, some producers and sellers will want to cut prices,
    because it is better to sell at a lower price than not to sell at
    all. Once some sellers start cutting prices, others will follow to
    avoid losing sales. These price reductions in turn will stimulate a
    higher quantity demanded. Therefore, if the price is above the
    equilibrium level, incentives built into the structure of demand and
    supply will create pressures for the price to fall toward the
    equilibrium.

    <a href="#bookmark177" class="s34">Now suppose that the price is below its equilibrium level at $1.20 per gallon, as the dashed horizontal line at this price in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark177" class="a">Figure 3.4</a> <span
    class="p">shows. At this lower price, the quantity demanded
    increases from 600 to 700 as drivers take longer trips, spend more
    minutes warming up the car in the driveway in wintertime, stop
    sharing rides to work, and buy larger cars that get fewer miles to
    the gallon. However, the below-equilibrium price reduces gasoline
    producers’ incentives to produce and sell gasoline, and the quantity
    supplied falls from 600 to 550.</span>

    <span id="bookmark183">When the price is below equilibrium, there
    is</span> **excess demand**, or a
    **shortage**<a href="#bookmark226" class="s34">—that is, at the given price the quantity demanded, which has been stimulated by the lower price, now exceeds the quantity supplied, which had been depressed by the lower price. In this situation, eager gasoline buyers mob the gas stations, only to find many stations running short of fuel. Oil companies and gas stations recognize that they have an opportunity to make higher profits by selling what gasoline they have at a higher price. As a result, the price rises toward the equilibrium level. Read</a>

    <span style=" color: #000;">to read a brief note on how marketing
    strategies can influence supply and demand of products.</span>

    <span id="bookmark185">The previous module explored how price
    affects the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied. The result
    was the demand curve and the supply curve. Price, however, is not
    the only factor that influences demand, nor is it the only thing
    that influences supply. For example, how is demand for vegetarian
    food affected if, say, health concerns cause more consumers to avoid
    eating meat? How is the supply of diamonds affected if diamond
    producers discover several new diamond mines? What are the major
    factors, in addition to the price, that influence demand or
    supply?</span>

      

      

    What Factors Affect Demand?

    We defined demand as the amount of some product a consumer is
    willing and able to purchase at each price. That suggests at least
    two factors in addition to price that affect demand. Willingness to
    purchase suggests a desire, based on what economists call tastes and
    preferences. If you neither need nor want something, you will not
    buy it. Ability to purchase suggests that income is important.
    Professors are usually able to afford better housing and
    transportation than students, because they have more income. Prices
    of related goods can affect demand also. If you need a new car, the
    price of a Honda may affect your demand for a Ford. Finally, the
    size or composition of the population can affect demand. The more
    children a family has, the greater their demand for clothing. The
    more driving-age children a family has, the greater their demand for
    car insurance, and the less for diapers and baby formula.

    These factors matter for both individual and market demand as a
    whole. Exactly how do these various factors affect demand, and how
    do we show the effects graphically? To answer those questions, we
    need the *ceteris paribus* assumption.

    The *Ceteris Paribus* Assumption

    <span id="bookmark186">A demand curve or a supply curve is a
    relationship between two, and only two, variables: quantity on the
    horizontal axis and price on the vertical axis. The assumption
    behind a demand curve or a supply curve is that no relevant economic
    factors, other than the product’s price, are changing. Economists
    call this assumption</span> **ceteris paribus**, a Latin phrase
    meaning “other things being equal.” Any given demand or supply curve
    is based on the *ceteris paribus* assumption that all else is held
    equal. A demand curve or a supply curve is a relationship between
    two, and only two, variables when all other variables are kept
    constant. If all else is not held equal, then the laws of supply and
    demand will not necessarily hold, as the following Clear It Up
    feature shows.<span id="bookmark187">‌</span>

      

    When does *ceteris paribus* apply?

    We typically apply *ceteris paribus* when we observe how changes in
    price affect demand or supply, but we can apply *ceteris paribus*
    more generally. In the real world, demand and supply depend on more
    factors than just price. For example, a consumer’s demand depends on
    income and a producer’s supply depends on the cost of producing the
    product. How can we analyze the effect on demand or supply if
    multiple factors are changing at the same time—say price rises and
    income falls? The answer is that we examine the changes one at a
    time, assuming the other factors are held constant.

    For example, we can say that an increase in the price reduces the
    amount consumers will buy (assuming income, and anything else that
    affects demand, is unchanged). Additionally, a decrease in income
    reduces the amount consumers can afford to buy (assuming price, and
    anything else that affects demand, is unchanged). This is what the
    *ceteris paribus* assumption really means. In this particular case,
    after we analyze each factor separately, we can combine the results.
    The amount consumers buy falls for two reasons: first because of the
    higher price and second because of the lower income.

    How Does Income Affect Demand?

    <a href="#bookmark188" class="s34">Let’s use income as an example of how factors other than price affect demand.</a>
    <a href="#bookmark188" class="a">Figure 3.5</a><span class="s54">
    </span>shows the initial demand for automobiles as D<span
    class="s60">0</span>. At point Q, for example, if the price is
    $20,000 per car, the quantity of cars demanded is 18 million. D<span
    class="s60">0</span> also shows how the quantity of cars demanded
    would change as a result of a higher or lower price. For example, if
    the price of a car rose to $22,000, the quantity demanded would
    decrease to 17 million, at point R.

    The original demand curve D<span class="s60">0</span>, like every
    demand curve, is based on the *ceteris paribus* assumption that no
    other economically relevant factors change. Now imagine that the
    economy expands in a way that raises the incomes of many people,
    making cars more affordable. How will this affect demand? How can we
    show this graphically?

    <a href="#bookmark188" class="s34">Return to</a>
    <a href="#bookmark188" class="a">Figure</a> 3.5<span class="p">. The
    price of cars is still $20,000, but with higher incomes, the
    quantity demanded has now increased to 20 million cars, shown at
    point S. As a result of the higher income levels, the demand curve
    shifts to the right to the new demand curve D</span><span
    class="s60">1</span><a href="#bookmark189" class="s34">, indicating an increase in demand.</a>
    <a href="#bookmark189" class="a">Table 3.4</a> <span class="p">shows
    clearly that this increased demand would occur at every price, not
    just the original one.</span>

    Table 3.4 Price and Demand Shifts: A Car Example

      

    Now, imagine that the economy slows down so that many people lose
    their jobs or work fewer hours, reducing their incomes. In this
    case, the decrease in income would lead to a lower quantity of cars
    demanded at every given price, and the original demand curve D<span
    class="s60">0</span> would shift left to D<span
    class="s60">2</span>. The shift from D<span class="s60">0</span> to
    D<span class="s60">2</span> represents such a decrease in demand: At
    any given price level, the quantity demanded is now lower. In this
    example, a price of $20,000 means 18 million cars sold along the
    original demand curve, but only 14.4 million sold after demand fell.

    When a demand curve shifts, it does not mean that the quantity
    demanded by every individual buyer changes by the same amount. In
    this example, not everyone would have higher or lower income and not
    everyone would buy or not buy an additional car. Instead, a shift in
    a demand curve captures a pattern for the market as a whole.

    <span id="bookmark190">In the previous section, we argued that
    higher income causes greater demand at every price. This is true for
    most goods and services. For some—luxury cars, vacations in Europe,
    and fine jewelry—the effect of a rise in income can be especially
    pronounced. A product whose demand rises when income rises, and vice
    versa, is called a</span> **normal good**. A few exceptions to this
    pattern do exist. As incomes rise, many people will buy fewer
    generic brand groceries and more name brand groceries. They are less
    likely to buy used cars and more likely to buy new cars. They will
    be less likely to rent an apartment and more likely to own a home. A
    product whose demand falls when income rises, and vice versa, is
    called an **inferior good**. In other words, when income increases,
    the demand curve shifts to the left.<span id="bookmark191">‌</span>

    Other Factors That Shift Demand Curves

    Income is not the only factor that causes a shift in demand. Other
    factors that change demand include tastes and preferences, the
    composition or size of the population, the prices of related goods,
    and even expectations. A change in any one of the underlying factors
    that determine what quantity people are willing to buy at a given
    price will cause a shift in demand. Graphically, the new demand
    curve lies either to the right (an increase) or to the left (a
    decrease) of the original demand curve. Let’s look at these factors.

    Changing Tastes or Preferences

    From 1980 to 2014, the per-person consumption of chicken by
    Americans rose from 48 pounds per year to 85 pounds per year, and
    consumption of beef fell from 77 pounds per year to 54 pounds per
    year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).
    Changes like these are largely due to movements in taste, which
    change the quantity of a good demanded at every price: that is, they
    shift the demand curve for that good, rightward for chicken and
    leftward for beef.

    Changes in the Composition of the Population

    <span id="bookmark192">The proportion of elderly citizens in the
    United States population is rising. It rose from 9.8% in 1970 to
    12.6% in 2000, and will be a projected (by the U.S. Census Bureau)
    20% of the population by 2030. A society with relatively more
    children, like the United States in the 1960s, will have greater
    demand for goods and services like tricycles and day care
    facilities. A society with relatively more elderly persons, as the
    United States is projected to have by 2030, has a higher demand for
    nursing homes and hearing aids. Similarly, changes in the size of
    the population can affect the demand for housing and many other
    goods. Each of these changes in demand will be shown as a shift in
    the demand curve.</span>

    Changes in the prices of related goods such as substitutes or
    complements also can affect the demand for a product. A

      

      

    <span id="bookmark193">substitute</span> <span class="p">is a good
    or service that we can use in place of another good or service. As
    electronic books, like this one, become more available, you would
    expect to see a decrease in demand for traditional printed books. A
    lower price for a substitute decreases demand for the other product.
    For example, in recent years as the price of tablet computers has
    fallen, the quantity demanded has increased (because of the law of
    demand). Since people are purchasing tablets, there has been a
    decrease in demand for laptops, which we can show graphically as a
    leftward shift in the demand curve for laptops. A higher price for a
    substitute good has the reverse effect.</span>

    <span id="bookmark194">Other goods are</span> **complements** for
    each other, meaning we often use the goods together, because
    consumption of one good tends to enhance consumption of the other.
    Examples include breakfast cereal and milk; notebooks and pens or
    pencils, golf balls and golf clubs; gasoline and sport utility
    vehicles; and the five-way combination of bacon, lettuce, tomato,
    mayonnaise, and bread. If the price of golf clubs rises, since the
    quantity demanded of golf clubs falls (because of the law of
    demand), demand for a complement good like golf balls decreases,
    too. Similarly, a higher price for skis would shift the demand curve
    for a complement good like ski resort trips to the left, while a
    lower price for a complement has the reverse effect.

    Changes in Expectations about Future Prices or Other Factors that
    Affect Demand

    Shift in Demand

    A shift in demand means that at any price (and at every price), the
    quantity demanded will be different than it was before. Following is
    an example of a shift in demand due to an income increase.

    Step 1. Draw the graph of a demand curve for a normal good like
    pizza. Pick a price (like P<span class="s63">0</span>). Identify the
    corresponding Q<span
    class="s63">0</span><a href="#bookmark196" class="s84">. See an example in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark196" class="s43">Figure</a> <span
    class="s36">3.6</span>.

    <span id="bookmark195">While it is clear that the price of a good
    affects the quantity demanded, it is also true that expectations
    about the future price (or expectations about tastes and
    preferences, income, and so on) can affect demand. For example, if
    people hear that a hurricane is coming, they may rush to the store
    to buy flashlight batteries and bottled water. If people learn that
    the price of a good like coffee is likely to rise in the future,
    they may head for the store to stock up on coffee now. We show these
    changes in demand as shifts in the curve. Therefore, a</span>
    **shift in demand** happens when a change in some economic factor
    (other than price) causes a different quantity to be demanded at
    every price. The following Work It Out feature shows how this
    happens.

    an increase in income, consumers will purchase larger quantities,
    pushing demand to the right.</span>

      

    <a href="#bookmark198" class="s84">Step 3. Now, shift the curve through the new point. You will see that an increase in income causes an upward (or rightward) shift in the demand curve, so that at any price the quantities demanded will be higher, as</a>

    Demand</span><span id="bookmark198">‌</span>

    <a href="#bookmark199" class="a">Figure 3.9</a> <span
    class="p">summarizes six factors that can shift demand curves. The
    direction of the arrows indicates whether the demand curve shifts
    represent an increase in demand or a decrease in demand. Notice that
    a change in the price of the good or service itself is not listed
    among the factors that can shift a demand curve. A change in the
    price of a good or service causes a movement along a specific demand
    curve, and it typically leads to some change in the quantity
    demanded, but it does not shift the demand curve.</span>

    When a demand curve shifts, it will then intersect with a given
    supply curve at a different equilibrium price and quantity. We are,
    however, getting ahead of our story. Before discussing how changes
    in demand can affect equilibrium price and quantity, we first need
    to discuss shifts in supply curves.

    How Production Costs Affect Supply

    <span id="bookmark200">A supply curve shows how quantity supplied
    will change as the price rises and falls, assuming</span> *ceteris
    paribus* so that no other economically relevant factors are
    changing. If other factors relevant to supply do change, then the
    entire supply curve will shift. Just as we described a shift in
    demand as a change in the quantity demanded at every price, a
    **shift in supply** means a change in the quantity supplied at every
    price.

    <span id="bookmark201">In thinking about the factors that affect
    supply, remember what motivates firms: profits, which are the
    difference between revenues and costs. A firm produces goods and
    services using combinations of labor, materials, and machinery, or
    what we call</span> **inputs** or **factors of production**. If a
    firm faces lower costs of production, while the prices for the good
    or service the firm produces remain unchanged, a firm’s profits go
    up. When a firm’s profits increase, it is more motivated to produce
    output, since the more it produces the more profit it will earn.
    When costs of production fall, a firm will tend to supply a larger
    quantity at any given price for its output. We can show this by the
    supply curve shifting to the right.

    Take, for example, a messenger company that delivers packages around
    a city. The company may find that buying gasoline is one of its main
    costs. If the price of gasoline falls, then the company will find it
    can deliver messages more cheaply than before. Since lower costs
    correspond to higher profits, the messenger company may now supply
    more of its services at any given price. For example, given the
    lower gasoline prices, the company can now serve a greater area, and
    increase its supply.

    Conversely, if a firm faces higher costs of production, then it will
    earn lower profits at any given selling price for its products. As a
    result, a higher cost of production typically causes a firm to
    supply a smaller quantity at any given price. In this case, the
    supply curve shifts to the left.

    Consider the supply for cars, shown by curve S<span
    class="s60">0</span> <a href="#bookmark202" class="s34">in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark202" class="a">Figure</a> <span
    class="s54">3.10</span>. Point J indicates that if the price is
    $20,000, the quantity supplied will be 18 million cars. If the price
    rises to $22,000 per car, *ceteris paribus,* the quantity supplied
    will rise to 20 million cars, as point K on the S<span
    class="s60">0</span>
    <a href="#bookmark203" class="s34">curve shows. We can show the same information in table form, as in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark203" class="a">Table</a> <span
    class="s54">3.5</span>.

      

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_072.jpg" width="376" height="282" alt="image" />

    <span id="bookmark202"><span class="s36">Figure 3.10 Shifts in
    Supply: A Car Example </span></span>Decreased supply means that at
    every given price, the quantity supplied is lower, so that the
    supply curve shifts to the left, from S<span class="s63">0</span> to
    S<span class="s63">1</span>. Increased supply means that at every
    given price, the quantity supplied is higher, so that the supply
    curve shifts to the right, from S<span class="s63">0</span> to
    S<span class="s63">2</span>.

    Table 3.5 Price and Shifts in Supply: A Car Example

      

    Now, imagine that the price of steel, an important ingredient in
    manufacturing cars, rises, so that producing a car has become more
    expensive. At any given price for selling cars, car manufacturers
    will react by supplying a lower quantity. We can show this
    graphically as a leftward shift of supply, from S<span
    class="s60">0</span> to S<span class="s60">1</span>, which indicates
    that at any given price, the quantity supplied decreases. In this
    example, at a price of $20,000, the quantity supplied decreases from
    18 million on the original supply curve (S<span
    class="s60">0</span>) to 16.5 million on the supply curve S<span
    class="s60">1</span>, which is labeled as point L.

    Conversely, if the price of steel decreases, producing a car becomes
    less expensive. At any given price for selling cars, car
    manufacturers can now expect to earn higher profits, so they will
    supply a higher quantity. The shift of supply to the right, from
    S<span class="s60">0</span> to S<span class="s60">2</span>, means
    that at all prices, the quantity supplied has increased. In this
    example, at a price of $20,000, the quantity supplied increases from
    18 million on the original supply curve (S<span
    class="s60">0</span>) to 19.8 million on the supply curve S<span
    class="s60">2</span>, which is labeled M.

    Other Factors That Affect Supply

    In the example above, we saw that changes in the prices of inputs in
    the production process will affect the cost of production and thus
    the supply. Several other things affect the cost of production, too,
    such as changes in weather or other natural conditions, new
    technologies for production, and some government policies.

    Changes in weather and climate will affect the cost of production
    for many agricultural products. For example, in

      

      

    2014 the Manchurian Plain in Northeastern China, which produces most
    of the country's wheat, corn, and soybeans, experienced its most
    severe drought in 50 years. A drought decreases the supply of
    agricultural products, which means that at any given price, a lower
    quantity will be supplied. Conversely, especially good weather would
    shift the supply curve to the right.

    <span id="bookmark204">When a firm discovers a new technology that
    allows the firm to produce at a lower cost, the supply curve will
    shift to the right, as well. For instance, in the 1960s a major
    scientific effort nicknamed the Green Revolution focused on breeding
    improved seeds for basic crops like wheat and rice. By the early
    1990s, more than two-thirds of the wheat and rice in low-income
    countries around the world used these Green Revolution seeds—and the
    harvest was twice as high per acre. A technological improvement that
    reduces costs of production will shift supply to the right, so that
    a greater quantity will be produced at any given price.</span>

    Government policies can affect the cost of production and the supply
    curve through taxes, regulations, and subsidies. For example, the
    U.S. government imposes a tax on alcoholic beverages that collects
    about $8 billion per year from producers. Businesses treat taxes as
    costs. Higher costs decrease supply for the reasons we discussed
    above. Other examples of policy that can affect cost are the wide
    array of government regulations that require firms to spend money to
    provide a cleaner environment or a safer workplace. Complying with
    regulations increases costs.

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_073.png" width="624" height="541" alt="image" />

    A government subsidy, on the other hand, is the opposite of a tax. A
    subsidy occurs when the government pays a firm directly or reduces
    the firm’s taxes if the firm carries out certain actions. From the
    firm’s perspective, taxes or regulations are an additional cost of
    production that shifts supply to the left, leading the firm to
    produce a lower quantity at every given price. Government subsidies
    reduce the cost of production and increase supply at every given
    price, shifting supply to the right. The following Work It Out
    feature shows how this shift happens.

      

    Shift in Supply

    We know that a supply curve shows the minimum price a firm will
    accept to produce a given quantity of output. What happens to the
    supply curve when the cost of production goes up? Following is an
    example of a shift in supply due to a production cost increase.

    Step 1. Draw a graph of a supply curve for pizza. Pick a quantity
    (like Q<span class="s63">0</span>). If you draw a vertical line up
    from Q<span class="s63">0</span>
    <a href="#bookmark205" class="s84">to the supply curve, you will see the price the firm chooses.</a>
    <a href="#bookmark205" class="s43">Figure 3.11</a><span class="s36">
    </span>provides an example.

      

      

    <span id="bookmark205">Figure 3.11 Supply Curve</span> <span
    class="s37">You can use a supply curve to show the minimum price a
    firm will accept to produce a given quantity of output.</span>

      

    <a href="#bookmark206" class="s84">Step 2. Why did the firm choose that price and not some other? One way to think about this is that the price is composed of two parts. The first part is the cost of producing pizzas at the margin; in this case, the cost of producing the pizza, including cost of ingredients (e.g., dough, sauce, cheese, and pepperoni), the cost of the pizza oven, the shop rent, and the workers' wages. The second part is the firm’s desired profit, which is determined, among other factors, by the profit margins in that particular business. If you add these two parts together, you get the price the firm wishes to charge. The quantity Q0 and associated price P0 give you one point on the firm’s supply curve, as</a>
    <a href="#bookmark206" class="s43">Figure 3.12</a> <span
    class="s37">illustrates.</span>

      

      

    <span id="bookmark206">Figure 3.12 Setting Prices</span> <span
    class="s37">The cost of production and the desired profit equal the
    price a firm will set for a product.</span>

      

    Step 3. Now, suppose that the cost of production increases. Perhaps
    cheese has become more expensive by

    <a href="#bookmark207" class="s84">$0.75 per pizza. If that is true, the firm will want to raise its price by the amount of the increase in cost ($0.75). Draw this point on the supply curve directly above the initial point on the curve, but $0.75 higher, as</a>
    <a href="#bookmark207" class="s43">Figure</a>

    3.13 <span class="s37">shows.</span>

      

      

    <span id="bookmark207">Figure 3.13 Increasing Costs Leads to
    Increasing Price</span> <span class="s37">Because the cost of
    production and the desired profit equal the price a firm will set

    the product will also need to increase.</span>

      

    <a href="#bookmark208" class="s84">Step 4. Shift the supply curve through this point. You will see that an increase in cost causes an upward (or a leftward) shift of the supply curve so that at any price, the quantities supplied will be smaller, as</a>

    Summing Up Factors That Change Supply

    Changes in the cost of inputs, natural disasters, new technologies,
    and the impact of government decisions all affect the cost of
    production. In turn, these factors affect how much firms are willing
    to supply at any given price.

    <a href="#bookmark209" class="a">Figure 3.15</a> <span
    class="p">summarizes factors that change the supply of goods and
    services. Notice that a change in the price of the product itself is
    not among the factors that shift the supply curve. Although a change
    in price of a good or service typically causes a change in quantity
    supplied or a movement along the supply curve for that specific good
    or service, it does not cause the supply curve itself to
    shift.</span>

    Because demand and supply curves appear on a two-dimensional diagram
    with only price and quantity on the axes, an unwary visitor to the
    land of economics might be fooled into believing that economics is
    about only four topics: demand, supply, price, and quantity.
    However, demand and supply are really “umbrella” concepts: demand
    covers all the factors that affect demand, and supply covers all the
    factors that affect supply. We include factors other than price that
    affect demand and supply are included by using shifts in the demand
    or the supply curve. In this way, the two-dimensional demand and
    supply model becomes a powerful tool for analyzing a wide range of
    economic circumstances.

3.  <span id="bookmark154">|</span> <span
    style=" color: #3767B1;">Changes in Equilibrium Price and Quantity:
    The Four-Step Process</span><span id="bookmark210">‌</span>

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Identify equilibrium price and quantity through the four-step
        process

    -   Graph equilibrium price and quantity

    -   Contrast shifts of demand or supply and movements along a demand
        or supply curve

    -   Graph demand and supply curves, including equilibrium price and
        quantity, based on real-world examples

      

    Let’s begin this discussion with a single economic event. It might
    be an event that affects demand, like a change in income,
    population, tastes, prices of substitutes or complements, or
    expectations about future prices. It might be an event that affects
    supply, like a change in natural conditions, input prices, or
    technology, or government policies that affect production. How does
    this economic event affect equilibrium price and quantity? We will
    analyze this question using a four-step process.

    Step 1. Draw a demand and supply model before the economic change
    took place. To establish the model requires four standard pieces of
    information: The law of demand, which tells us the slope of the
    demand curve; the law of supply, which gives us the slope of the
    supply curve; the shift variables for demand; and the shift
    variables for supply. From this model, find the initial equilibrium
    values for price and quantity.

    Step 2. Decide whether the economic change you are analyzing affects
    demand or supply. In other words, does the

      

      

    event refer to something in the list of demand factors or supply
    factors?

    Step 3. Decide whether the effect on demand or supply causes the
    curve to shift to the right or to the left, and sketch the new
    demand or supply curve on the diagram. In other words, does the
    event increase or decrease the amount consumers want to buy or
    producers want to sell?

    Step 4. Identify the new equilibrium and then compare the original
    equilibrium price and quantity to the new equilibrium price and
    quantity.

    Let’s consider one example that involves a shift in supply and one
    that involves a shift in demand. Then we will consider an example
    where both supply and demand shift.

    Good Weather for Salmon Fishing

    <a href="#bookmark211" class="s34">Supposed that during the summer of 2015, weather conditions were excellent for commercial salmon fishing off the California coast. Heavy rains meant higher than normal levels of water in the rivers, which helps the salmon to breed. Slightly cooler ocean temperatures stimulated the growth of plankton, the microscopic organisms at the bottom of the ocean food chain, providing everything in the ocean with a hearty food supply. The ocean stayed calm during fishing season, so commercial fishing operations did not lose many days to bad weather. How did these climate conditions affect the quantity and price of salmon?</a>

    Table 3.6 Salmon Fishing

      

    Step 1. Draw a demand and supply model to illustrate the market for
    salmon in the year before the good weather conditions began. The
    demand curve D<span class="s60">0</span> and the supply curve S<span
    class="s60">0</span> show that the original equilibrium price is
    $3.25 per pound and the original equilibrium quantity is 250,000
    fish. (This price per pound is what commercial buyers pay at the
    fishing docks. What consumers pay at the grocery is higher.)

    Step 2. Did the economic event affect supply or demand? Good weather
    is an example of a natural condition that affects supply.

    Step 3. Was the effect on supply an increase or a decrease? Good
    weather is a change in natural conditions that increases the
    quantity supplied at any given price. The supply curve shifts to the
    right, moving from the original supply curve S<span
    class="s60">0</span> to the new supply curve S<span
    class="s60">1</span><a href="#bookmark211" class="s34">, which</a>
    <a href="#bookmark211" class="a">Figure 3.16</a><span class="s54">
    </span><a href="#bookmark212" class="s34">and</a>
    <a href="#bookmark212" class="a">Table 3.6</a><span class="s54">
    </span>show.

    Step 4. Compare the new equilibrium price and quantity to the
    original equilibrium. At the new equilibrium E<span
    class="s60">1</span>, the equilibrium price falls from $3.25 to
    $2.50, but the equilibrium quantity increases from 250,000 to
    550,000 salmon. Notice that the equilibrium quantity demanded
    increased, even though the demand curve did not move.

    In short, good weather conditions increased supply of the California
    commercial salmon. The result was a higher equilibrium quantity of
    salmon bought and sold in the market at a lower price.

    Newspapers and the Internet

    <a href="#bookmark214" id="bookmark213" class="s34">According to the Pew Research Center for People and the Press, increasingly more people, especially younger people, are obtaining their news from online and digital sources. The majority of U.S. adults now own smartphones or tablets, and most of those Americans say they use them in part to access the news. From 2004 to 2012, the share of Americans who reported obtaining their news from digital sources increased from 24% to 39%. How has this affected consumption of print news media, and radio and television news?</a>
    <a href="#bookmark214" class="a">Figure 3.17</a> <span class="p">and
    the text below illustrates using the four-step analysis to answer
    this question.</span>

      

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_077.jpg" width="305" height="278" alt="image" />

    <span id="bookmark214">Figure 3.17 The Print News Market: A
    Four-Step Analysis</span> <span class="s37">A change in tastes from
    print news sources to digital sources results in a leftward shift in
    demand for the former. The result is a decrease in both equilibrium
    price and quantity.</span>

      

    Step 1. Develop a demand and supply model to think about what the
    market looked like before the event. The demand curve D<span
    class="s60">0</span> and the supply curve S<span
    class="s60">0</span> show the original relationships. In this case,
    we perform the analysis without

      

    specific numbers on the price and quantity axis.

    Step 2. Did the described change affect supply or demand? A change
    in tastes, from traditional news sources (print, radio, and
    television) to digital sources, caused a change in demand for the
    former.

    Step 3. Was the effect on demand positive or negative? A shift to
    digital news sources will tend to mean a lower quantity demanded of
    traditional news sources at every given price, causing the demand
    curve for print and other traditional news sources to shift to the
    left, from D<span class="s60">0</span> to D<span
    class="s60">1</span>.

    Step 4. Compare the new equilibrium price and quantity to the
    original equilibrium price. The new equilibrium (E<span
    class="s60">1</span>) occurs at a lower quantity and a lower price
    than the original equilibrium (E<span class="s60">0</span>).

    The decline in print news reading predates 2004. Print newspaper
    circulation peaked in 1973 and has declined since then due to
    competition from television and radio news. In 1991, 55% of
    Americans indicated they received their news from print sources,
    while only 29% did so in 2012. Radio news has followed a similar
    path in recent decades, with the share of Americans obtaining their
    news from radio declining from 54% in 1991 to 33% in 2012.
    Television news has held its own over the last 15 years, with a
    market share staying in the mid to upper fifties. What does this
    suggest for the future, given that two-thirds of Americans under 30
    years old say they do not obtain their news from television at all?

    The Interconnections and Speed of Adjustment in Real Markets

    In the real world, many factors that affect demand and supply can
    change all at once. For example, the demand for cars might increase
    because of rising incomes and population, and it might decrease
    because of rising gasoline prices (a complementary good). Likewise,
    the supply of cars might increase because of innovative new
    technologies that reduce the cost of car production, and it might
    decrease as a result of new government regulations requiring the
    installation of costly pollution-control technology.

    <span id="bookmark215">Moreover, rising incomes and population or
    changes in gasoline prices will affect many markets, not just cars.
    How can an economist sort out all these interconnected events? The
    answer lies in the</span> *ceteris paribus* assumption. Look at how
    each economic event affects each market, one event at a time,
    holding all else constant. Then combine the analyses to see the net
    effect.

    A Combined Example

    <a href="#bookmark216" class="s34">The U.S. Postal Service is facing difficult challenges. Compensation for postal workers tends to increase most years due to cost-of-living increases. At the same time, increasingly more people are using email, text, and other digital message forms such as Facebook and Twitter to communicate with friends and others. What does this suggest about the continued viability of the Postal Service?</a>
    <a href="#bookmark216" class="a">Figure 3.18</a> <span class="p">and
    the text below illustrate this using the four-step analysis to
    answer this question.</span>

      

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_078.jpg" width="619" height="301" alt="image" />

      

    <span id="bookmark216">Figure 3.18 Higher Compensation for Postal
    Workers: A Four-Step Analysis</span> <span class="s37">(a) Higher
    labor compensation causes a leftward shift in the supply curve, a
    decrease in the equilibrium quantity, and an increase in the
    equilibrium price. (b) A change in tastes away from Postal Services
    causes a leftward shift in the demand curve, a decrease in the
    equilibrium quantity, and a decrease in the equilibrium
    price.</span>

      

    Since this problem involves two disturbances, we need two four-step
    analyses, the first to analyze the effects of higher compensation
    for postal workers, the second to analyze the effects of many people
    switching from “snail mail” to email and other digital messages.

    <a href="#bookmark216" class="a">Figure 3.18</a> <span class="p">(a)
    shows the shift in supply discussed in the following steps.</span>

    Step 1. Draw a demand and supply model to illustrate what the market
    for the U.S. Postal Service looked like before this scenario starts.
    The demand curve D<span class="s60">0</span> and the supply curve
    S<span class="s60">0</span> show the original relationships.

    Step 2. Did the described change affect supply or demand? Labor
    compensation is a cost of production. A change in production costs
    caused a change in supply for the Postal Service.

    Step 3. Was the effect on supply positive or negative? Higher labor
    compensation leads to a lower quantity supplied of postal services
    at every given price, causing the supply curve for postal services
    to shift to the left, from S<span class="s60">0</span> to S<span
    class="s60">1</span>.

    Step 4. Compare the new equilibrium price and quantity to the
    original equilibrium price. The new equilibrium (E<span
    class="s60">1</span>) occurs at a lower quantity and a higher price
    than the original equilibrium (E<span class="s60">0</span>).

    <a href="#bookmark216" class="a">Figure 3.18</a> <span class="p">(b)
    shows the shift in demand in the following steps.</span>

    Step 1. Draw a demand and supply model to illustrate what the market
    for U.S. Postal Services looked like before this scenario starts.
    The demand curve D<span class="s60">0</span> and the supply curve
    S<span class="s60">0</span> show the original relationships. Note
    that this diagram is independent from the diagram in panel (a).

    Step 2. Did the change described affect supply or demand? A change
    in tastes away from snail mail toward digital messages will cause a
    change in demand for the Postal Service.

    Step 3. Was the effect on demand positive or negative? A change in
    tastes away from snailmail toward digital messages causes lower
    quantity demanded of postal services at every given price, causing
    the demand curve for postal services to shift to the left, from
    D<span class="s60">0</span> to D<span class="s60">1</span>.

    Step 4. Compare the new equilibrium price and quantity to the
    original equilibrium price. The new equilibrium (E<span
    class="s60">2</span>) occurs at a lower quantity and a lower price
    than the original equilibrium (E<span class="s60">0</span>).

    <a href="#bookmark217" class="s34">The final step in a scenario where both supply and demand shift is to combine the two individual analyses to determine what happens to the equilibrium quantity and price. Graphically, we superimpose the previous two diagrams one on top of the other, as in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark217" class="a">Figure</a> 3.19<span
    class="p">.</span>

    Demand and Decreased Supply</span> <span class="s37">Supply and
    demand shifts cause changes in equilibrium price and
    quantity.</span>

      

    Following are the results:

    Effect on Quantity: The effect of higher labor compensation on
    Postal Services because it raises the cost of production is to
    decrease the equilibrium quantity. The effect of a change in tastes
    away from snail mail is to decrease the equilibrium quantity. Since
    both shifts are to the left, the overall impact is a decrease in the
    equilibrium quantity of Postal Services (Q<span
    class="s60">3</span>). This is easy to see graphically, since Q<span
    class="s60">3</span> is to the left of Q<span class="s60">0</span>.

    Effect on Price: The overall effect on price is more complicated.
    The effect of higher labor compensation on Postal Services, because
    it raises the cost of production, is to increase the equilibrium
    price. The effect of a change in tastes away from snail mail is to
    decrease the equilibrium price. Since the two effects are in
    opposite directions, unless we know the magnitudes of the two
    effects, the overall effect is unclear. This is not unusual. When
    both curves shift, typically we can determine the overall effect on
    price or on quantity, but not on both. In this case, we determined
    the overall effect on the equilibrium quantity, but not on the
    equilibrium price. In other cases, it might be the opposite.

    What is the difference between shifts of demand or supply versus
    movements along a demand or supply curve?

    One common mistake in applying the demand and supply framework is to
    confuse the shift of a demand or a supply curve with movement along
    a demand or supply curve. As an example, consider a problem that
    asks whether a drought will increase or decrease the equilibrium
    quantity and equilibrium price of wheat. Lee, a student in an
    introductory economics class, might reason:

    <span id="bookmark218">“Well, it is clear that a drought reduces
    supply, so I will shift back the supply curve, as in the shift from
    the original supply curve S</span><span class="s63">0</span> to
    S<span class="s63">1</span> on the diagram (Shift 1). The
    equilibrium moves from E<span class="s63">0</span> to E<span
    class="s63">1</span>, the equilibrium quantity is lower and the
    equilibrium price is higher. Then, a higher price makes farmers more
    likely to supply the good, so the supply curve shifts right, as
    shows the shift from S<span class="s63">1</span> to S<span
    class="s63">2</span>, shows on the diagram (Shift 2), so that the
    equilibrium now moves from E<span class="s63">1</span> to E<span
    class="s63">2</span>. The higher price, however, also reduces demand
    and so causes demand to shift back, like the shift from the original
    demand curve, D<span class="s63">0</span> to D<span
    class="s63">1</span> on the diagram (labeled

    The next Clear It Up feature focuses on the difference between
    shifts of supply or demand and movements along a curve.

    Shift 3), and the equilibrium moves from E<span class="s63">2</span>
    to E<span class="s63">3</span>.”

      

    Figure 3.20 Shifts of Demand or Supply versus Movements along a
    Demand or Supply Curve <span class="s37">A shift in one curve never
    causes a shift in the other curve. Rather, a shift in one curve
    causes a movement along the second curve.</span>

      

    At about this point, Lee suspects that this answer is headed down
    the wrong path. Think about what might be wrong with Lee’s logic,
    and then read the answer that follows.

    *Answer:* Lee’s first step is correct: that is, a drought shifts
    back the supply curve of wheat and leads to a prediction of a lower
    equilibrium quantity and a higher equilibrium price. This
    corresponds to a movement along the original demand curve (D<span
    class="s63">0</span>), from E<span class="s63">0</span> to E<span
    class="s63">1</span>. The rest of Lee’s argument is wrong, because
    it mixes up shifts in supply with quantity supplied, and shifts in
    demand with quantity demanded. A higher or lower price never shifts
    the supply curve, as suggested by the shift in supply from S<span
    class="s63">1</span> to S<span class="s63">2</span>. Instead, a
    price change leads to a movement along a given supply curve.
    Similarly, a higher or lower price never shifts a demand curve, as
    suggested in the shift from D<span class="s63">0</span> to D<span
    class="s63">1</span>. Instead, a price change leads to a movement
    along a given demand curve. Remember, a change in the price of a
    good never causes the demand or supply curve for that good to shift.

    Think carefully about the timeline of events: What happens first,
    what happens next? What is cause, what is effect? If you keep the
    order right, you are more likely to get the analysis correct.

    In the four-step analysis of how economic events affect equilibrium
    price and quantity, the movement from the old to the new equilibrium
    seems immediate. As a practical matter, however, prices and
    quantities often do not zoom straight to equilibrium. More
    realistically, when an economic event causes demand or supply to
    shift, prices and quantities set off in the general direction of
    equilibrium. Even as they are moving toward one new equilibrium, a
    subsequent change in demand or supply often pushes prices toward
    another equilibrium.

    Ceilings and Price Floors</span><span id="bookmark219">‌</span>

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Explain price controls, price ceilings, and price floors

    -   Analyze demand and supply as a social adjustment mechanism

      

    To this point in the chapter, we have been assuming that markets are
    free, that is, they operate with no government intervention. In this
    section, we will explore the outcomes, both anticipated and
    otherwise, when government does intervene in a market either to
    prevent the price of some good or service from rising “too high” or
    to prevent the price of some good or service from falling “too low”.

      

      

    Economists believe there are a small number of fundamental
    principles that explain how economic agents respond in different
    situations. Two of these principles, which we have already
    introduced, are the laws of demand and supply.

    Governments can pass laws affecting market outcomes, but no law can
    negate these economic principles. Rather, the principles will become
    apparent in sometimes unexpected ways, which may undermine the
    intent of the government policy. This is one of the major
    conclusions of this section.

    Controversy sometimes surrounds the prices and quantities
    established by demand and supply, especially for products that are
    considered necessities. In some cases, discontent over prices turns
    into public pressure on politicians, who may then pass legislation
    to prevent a certain price from climbing “too high” or falling “too
    low.”

    The demand and supply model shows how people and firms will react to
    the incentives that these laws provide to control prices, in ways
    that will often lead to undesirable consequences. Alternative policy
    tools can often achieve the desired goals of price control laws,
    while avoiding at least some of their costs and tradeoffs.

    Price Ceilings

    <span id="bookmark220">Laws that government enact to regulate prices
    are called</span> **price controls**. Price controls come in two
    flavors. A **price ceiling** keeps a price from rising above a
    certain level (the “ceiling”), while a **price floor** keeps a price
    from falling below a given level (the “floor”). This section uses
    the demand and supply framework to analyze price ceilings. The next
    section discusses price floors.<span id="bookmark221">‌</span>

    A price ceiling is a legal maximum price that one pays for some good
    or service. A government imposes price ceilings in order to keep the
    price of some necessary good or service affordable. For example, in
    2005 during Hurricane Katrina, the price of bottled water increased
    above $5 per gallon. As a result, many people called for price
    controls on bottled water to prevent the price from rising so high.
    In this particular case, the government did not impose a price
    ceiling, but there are other examples of where price ceilings did
    occur.

    In many markets for goods and services, demanders outnumber
    suppliers. Consumers, who are also potential voters, sometimes unite
    behind a political proposal to hold down a certain price. In some
    cities, such as Albany, renters have pressed political leaders to
    pass rent control laws, a price ceiling that usually works by
    stating that landlords can raise rents by only a certain maximum
    percentage each year. Some of the best examples of rent control
    occur in urban areas such as New York, Washington D.C., or San
    Francisco.

    <a href="#bookmark222" class="s34">Rent control becomes a politically hot topic when rents begin to rise rapidly. Everyone needs an affordable place to live. Perhaps a change in tastes makes a certain suburb or town a more popular place to live. Perhaps locally-based businesses expand, bringing higher incomes and more people into the area. Such changes can cause a change in the demand for rental housing, as</a>
    <a href="#bookmark222" class="a">Figure 3.21</a><span class="s54">
    </span>illustrates. The original equilibrium (E<span
    class="s60">0</span>) lies at the intersection of supply curve
    S<span class="s60">0</span> and demand curve D<span
    class="s60">0</span><a href="#bookmark223" class="s34">, corresponding to an equilibrium price of $500 and an equilibrium quantity of 15,000 units of rental housing. The effect of greater income or a change in tastes is to shift the demand curve for rental housing to the right, as the data in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark223" class="a">Table 3.7</a><span class="s54">
    </span>shows and the shift from D<span class="s60">0</span> to
    D<span class="s60">1</span> on the graph. In this market, at the new
    equilibrium E<span class="s60">1</span>, the price of a rental unit
    would rise to $600 and the equilibrium quantity would increase to
    17,000 units.

    demanded rises to 19,000, resulting in a shortage.

    Table 3.7 Rent Control

      

    <a href="#bookmark222" class="s34">Suppose that a city government passes a rent control law to keep the price at the original equilibrium of $500 for a typical apartment. In</a>
    <a href="#bookmark222" class="a">Figure</a> 3.21<span class="p">,
    the horizontal line at the price of $500 shows the legally fixed
    maximum price set by the rent control law. However, the underlying
    forces that shifted the demand curve to the right are still there.
    At that price ($500), the quantity supplied remains at the same
    15,000 rental units, but the quantity demanded is 19,000 rental
    units. In other words, the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity
    supplied, so there is a shortage of rental housing. One of the
    ironies of price ceilings is that while the price ceiling was
    intended to help renters, there are actually fewer apartments rented
    out under the price ceiling (15,000 rental units) than would be the
    case at the market rent of $600 (17,000 rental units).</span>

    Price ceilings do not simply benefit renters at the expense of
    landlords. Rather, some renters (or potential renters) lose their
    housing as landlords convert apartments to co-ops and condos. Even
    when the housing remains in the rental market, landlords tend to
    spend less on maintenance and on essentials like heating, cooling,
    hot water, and lighting. The first rule of economics is you do not
    get something for nothing—everything has an opportunity cost. Thus,
    if renters obtain “cheaper” housing than the market requires, they
    tend to also end up with lower quality housing.

    Price ceilings are enacted in an attempt to keep prices low for
    those who need the product. However, when the market price is not
    allowed to rise to the equilibrium level, quantity demanded exceeds
    quantity supplied, and thus a shortage occurs. Those who manage to
    purchase the product at the lower price given by the price ceiling
    will benefit, but sellers of the product will suffer, along with
    those who are not able to purchase the product at all. Quality is
    also likely to deteriorate.

    Price Floors

    A price floor is the lowest price that one can legally pay for some
    good or service. Perhaps the best-known example

      

      

    of a price floor is the minimum wage, which is based on the view
    that someone working full time should be able to afford a basic
    standard of living. The federal minimum wage in 2016 was $7.25 per
    hour, although some states and localities have a higher minimum
    wage. The federal minimum wage yields an annual income for a single
    person of

    $15,080, which is slightly higher than the Federal poverty line of
    $11,880. As the cost of living rises over time, the Congress
    periodically raises the federal minimum wage.

    Price floors are sometimes called “price supports,” because they
    support a price by preventing it from falling below a certain level.
    Around the world, many countries have passed laws to create
    agricultural price supports. Farm prices and thus farm incomes
    fluctuate, sometimes widely. Even if, on average, farm incomes are
    adequate, some years they can be quite low. The purpose of price
    supports is to prevent these swings.

    <span id="bookmark224">The most common way price supports work is
    that the government enters the market and buys up the product,
    adding to demand to keep prices higher than they otherwise would be.
    According to the Common Agricultural Policy reform passed in 2013,
    the European Union (EU) will spend about 60 billion euros per year,
    or 67 billion dollars per year (with the November 2016 exchange
    rate), or roughly 38% of the EU budget, on price supports for
    Europe’s farmers from 2014 to 2020.</span>

    class="s60">0</span>. However, policies to keep prices high for
    farmers keeps the price above what would have been the market
    equilibrium level—the price Pf shown by the dashed horizontal line
    in the diagram. The result is a quantity supplied in excess of the
    quantity demanded (Qd). When quantity supplied exceeds quantity
    demanded, a surplus exists.

    Economists estimate that the high-income areas of the world,
    including the United States, Europe, and Japan, spend roughly $1
    billion per day in supporting their farmers. If the government is
    willing to purchase the excess supply (or to provide payments for
    others to purchase it), then farmers will benefit from the price
    floor, but taxpayers and consumers of food will pay the costs.
    Agricultural economists and policy makers have offered numerous
    proposals for reducing farm subsidies. In many countries, however,
    political support for subsidies for farmers remains strong. This is
    either because the population views this as supporting the
    traditional rural way of life or because of industry's lobbying
    power of the agro-business.

5.  <span id="bookmark156">|</span> <span
    style=" color: #3767B1;">Demand, Supply, and Efficiency</span><span
    id="bookmark226">‌</span>

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Contrast consumer surplus, producer surplus, and social surplus

    -   Explain why price floors and price ceilings can be inefficient

    -   Analyze demand and supply as a social adjustment mechanism

      

    <span id="bookmark227">The familiar demand and supply diagram holds
    within it the concept of economic efficiency. One typical way that
    economists define efficiency is when it is impossible to improve the
    situation of one party without imposing a cost on another.
    Conversely, if a situation is inefficient, it becomes possible to
    benefit at least one party without imposing costs on
    others.</span><span id="bookmark228">‌</span>

    Efficiency in the demand and supply model has the same basic
    meaning: The economy is getting as much benefit as possible from its
    scarce resources and all the possible gains from trade have been
    achieved. In other words, the optimal amount of each good and
    service is produced and consumed.

    Consumer Surplus, Producer Surplus, Social Surplus

    <a href="#bookmark231" id="bookmark229" class="s34">Consider a market for tablet computers, as</a>
    <a href="#bookmark231" class="a">Figure 3.23</a> <span
    class="p">shows. The equilibrium price is $80 and the equilibrium
    quantity is 28 million. To see the benefits to consumers, look at
    the segment of the demand curve above the equilibrium point and to
    the left. This portion of the demand curve shows that at least some
    demanders would have been willing to pay more than $80 for a
    tablet.</span>

    <span id="bookmark230">For example, point J shows that if the price
    were $90, 20 million tablets would be sold. Those consumers who
    would have been willing to pay $90 for a tablet based on the utility
    they expect to receive from it, but who were able to pay the
    equilibrium price of $80, clearly received a benefit beyond what
    they had to pay. Remember, the demand curve traces consumers’
    willingness to pay for different quantities. The amount that
    individuals would have been willing to pay, minus the amount that
    they actually paid, is called</span> **consumer surplus**. Consumer
    surplus is the area labeled F—that is, the area above the market
    price and below the demand curve.

      

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_084.jpg" width="296" height="272" alt="image" />

    <span id="bookmark231">Figure 3.23 Consumer and Producer
    Surplus</span> <span class="s37">The somewhat triangular area
    labeled by F shows the area of consumer surplus, which shows that
    the equilibrium price in the market was less than what many of the
    consumers were willing to pay. Point J on the demand curve shows
    that, even at the price of $90, consumers would have been willing to
    purchase a quantity of 20 million. The somewhat triangular area
    labeled by G shows the area of producer surplus, which shows that
    the equilibrium price received in the market was more than what many
    of the producers were willing to accept for their products. For
    example, point K on the supply curve shows that at a price of $45,
    firms would have been willing to supply a quantity of 14
    million.</span>

      

    <a href="#bookmark231" class="s34">The supply curve shows the quantity that firms are willing to supply at each price. For example, point K in</a>
    [Figure](#bookmark231)

      

    <a href="#bookmark231" id="bookmark232" class="a">3.23</a> <span
    class="p">illustrates that, at $45, firms would still have been
    willing to supply a quantity of 14 million. Those producers who
    would have been willing to supply the tablets at $45, but who were
    instead able to charge the equilibrium price of $80, clearly
    received an extra benefit beyond what they required to supply the
    product. The amount that a seller is paid for a good minus the
    seller’s actual cost is called </span><span class="s31">producer
    surplus</span><a href="#bookmark231" class="s34">. In</a>
    <a href="#bookmark231" class="a">Figure</a> 3.23<span class="p">,
    producer surplus is the area labeled G—that is, the area between the
    market price and the segment of the supply curve below the
    equilibrium.</span>

    <span id="bookmark233">The sum of consumer surplus and producer
    surplus is</span> **social surplus**, also referred to as **economic
    surplus** or **total
    surplus**<a href="#bookmark231" class="s34">. In</a>
    <a href="#bookmark231" class="a">Figure 3.23</a><span class="s54">
    </span>we show social surplus as the area F + G. Social surplus is
    larger at equilibrium quantity and price than it would be at any
    other quantity. This demonstrates the economic efficiency of the
    market equilibrium. In addition, at the efficient level of output,
    it is impossible to produce greater consumer surplus without
    reducing producer surplus, and it is impossible to produce greater
    producer surplus without reducing consumer surplus.

    Inefficiency of Price Floors and Price Ceilings

    The imposition of a price floor or a price ceiling will prevent a
    market from adjusting to its equilibrium price and quantity, and
    thus will create an inefficient outcome. However, there is an
    additional twist here. Along with creating inefficiency, price
    floors and ceilings will also transfer some consumer surplus to
    producers, or some producer surplus to consumers.

    <a href="#bookmark237" class="s34">Imagine that several firms develop a promising but expensive new drug for treating back pain. If this therapy is left to the market, the equilibrium price will be $600 per month and 20,000 people will use the drug, as shown in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark237" class="a">Figure 3.24</a> <span
    class="p">(a). The original level of consumer surplus is T + U and
    producer surplus is V + W + X. However, the government decides to
    impose a price ceiling of $400 to make the drug more affordable. At
    this price ceiling, firms in the market now produce only
    15,000.</span>

    <span id="bookmark234">As a result, two changes occur. First, an
    inefficient outcome occurs and the total surplus of society is
    reduced. The loss in social surplus that occurs when the economy
    produces at an inefficient quantity is called</span> **deadweight
    loss**<a href="#bookmark237" class="s34">. In a very real sense, it is like money thrown away that benefits no one. In</a>
    <a href="#bookmark237" class="a">Figure 3.24</a><span class="s54">
    </span>(a), the deadweight loss is the area U + W. When deadweight
    loss exists, it is possible for both consumer and producer surplus
    to be higher, in this case because the price control is blocking
    some suppliers and demanders from transactions they would both be
    willing to make.<span id="bookmark235">‌</span>

    <span id="bookmark236">A second change from the price ceiling is
    that some of the producer surplus is transferred to consumers. After
    the price ceiling is imposed, the new consumer surplus is T + V,
    while the new producer surplus is X. In other words, the price
    ceiling transfers the area of surplus (V) from producers to
    consumers. Note that the gain to consumers is less than the loss to
    producers, which is just another way of seeing the deadweight
    loss.</span>

      

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_085.jpg" width="498" height="256" alt="image" />

      

    <span id="bookmark237">Figure 3.24 Efficiency and Price Floors and
    Ceilings</span> <span class="s37">(a) The original equilibrium price
    is $600 with a quantity of 20,000. Consumer surplus is T + U, and
    producer surplus is V + W + X. A price ceiling is imposed at $400,
    so firms in the market now produce only a quantity of 15,000. As a
    result, the new consumer surplus is T + V, while the new producer
    surplus is X. (b) The original equilibrium is $8 at a quantity of
    1,800. Consumer surplus is G + H + J, and producer surplus is I + K.
    A price floor is imposed at $12, which means that quantity demanded
    falls to 1,400. As a result, the new consumer surplus is G, and the
    new producer surplus is H + I.</span>

      

    <a href="#bookmark237" class="a">Figure 3.24</a> <span class="p">(b)
    shows a price floor example using a string of struggling movie
    theaters, all in the same city. The current equilibrium is $8 per
    movie ticket, with 1,800 people attending movies. The original
    consumer surplus is G</span>

    <span id="bookmark238">+ H + J, and producer surplus is I + K. The
    city government is worried that movie theaters will go out of
    business, reducing the entertainment options available to citizens,
    so it decides to impose a price floor of $12 per ticket. As a
    result, the quantity demanded of movie tickets falls to 1,400. The
    new consumer surplus is G, and the new producer surplus is H + I. In
    effect, the price floor causes the area H to be transferred from
    consumer to producer surplus, but also causes a deadweight loss of
    J + K.</span>

    This analysis shows that a price ceiling, like a law establishing
    rent controls, will transfer some producer surplus to
    consumers—which helps to explain why consumers often favor them.
    Conversely, a price floor like a guarantee that farmers will receive
    a certain price for their crops will transfer some consumer surplus
    to producers, which explains why producers often favor them.
    However, both price floors and price ceilings block some
    transactions that buyers and sellers would have been willing to
    make, and creates deadweight loss. Removing such barriers, so that
    prices and quantities can adjust to their equilibrium level, will
    increase the economy’s social surplus.

    Demand and Supply as a Social Adjustment Mechanism

    <span id="bookmark239">The demand and supply model emphasizes that
    prices are not set only by demand or only by supply, but by the
    interaction between the two. In 1890, the famous economist Alfred
    Marshall wrote that asking whether supply or demand determined a
    price was like arguing “whether it is the upper or the under blade
    of a pair of scissors that cuts a piece of paper.” The answer is
    that both blades of the demand and supply scissors are always
    involved.</span>

    The adjustments of equilibrium price and quantity in a
    market-oriented economy often occur without much government
    direction or oversight. If the coffee crop in Brazil suffers a
    terrible frost, then the supply curve of coffee shifts to the left
    and the price of coffee rises. Some people—call them the coffee
    addicts—continue to drink coffee and pay the higher price. Others
    switch to tea or soft drinks. No government commission is needed to
    figure out how to adjust coffee prices, which companies will be
    allowed to process the remaining supply, which supermarkets in which
    cities will get how much coffee to sell, or which consumers will
    ultimately be allowed to drink the brew. Such adjustments in
    response to price changes happen all the time in a market economy,
    often so smoothly and rapidly that we barely notice them.

    Think for a moment of all the seasonal foods that are available and
    inexpensive at certain times of the year, like fresh corn in
    midsummer, but more expensive at other times of the year. People
    alter their diets and restaurants alter their menus in response to
    these fluctuations in prices without fuss or fanfare. For both the
    U.S. economy and the world

      

      

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_086.png" width="624" height="482" alt="image" />

    economy as a whole, markets—that is, demand and supply—are the
    primary social mechanism for answering the basic questions about
    what is produced, how it is produced, and for whom it is produced.

      

    Why Can We Not Get Enough of Organic?

    Organic food is grown without synthetic pesticides, chemical
    fertilizers or genetically modified seeds. In recent decades, the
    demand for organic products has increased dramatically. The Organic
    Trade Association reported sales increased from $1 billion in 1990
    to $35.1 billion in 2013, more than 90% of which were sales of food
    products.

    Why, then, are organic foods more expensive than their conventional
    counterparts? The answer is a clear application of the theories of
    supply and demand. As people have learned more about the harmful
    effects of chemical fertilizers, growth hormones, pesticides and the
    like from large-scale factory farming, our tastes and preferences
    for safer, organic foods have increased. This change in tastes has
    been reinforced by increases in income, which allow people to
    purchase pricier products, and has made organic foods more
    mainstream. This has led to an increased demand for organic foods.
    Graphically, the demand curve has shifted right, and we have moved
    up the supply curve as producers have responded to the higher prices
    by supplying a greater quantity.

    In addition to the movement along the supply curve, we have also had
    an increase in the number of farmers converting to organic farming
    over time. This is represented by a shift to the right of the supply
    curve. Since both demand and supply have shifted to the right, the
    resulting equilibrium quantity of organic foods is definitely
    higher, but the price will only fall when the increase in supply is
    larger than the increase in demand. We may need more time before we
    see lower prices in organic foods. Since the production costs of
    these foods may remain higher than conventional farming, because
    organic fertilizers and pest management techniques are more
    expensive, they may never fully catch up with the lower prices of
    non-organic foods.

    As a final, specific example: The Environmental Working Group’s
    “Dirty Dozen” list of fruits and vegetables, which test high for
    pesticide residue even after washing, was released in April 2013.
    The inclusion of strawberries on the list has led to an increase in
    demand for organic strawberries, resulting in both a higher
    equilibrium price and quantity of sales.

    KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY

      

    1.  <a href="#bookmark160" class="a">Demand, Supply, and Equilibrium in Markets for Goods and</a>
        [Services](#bookmark160)

        A demand schedule is a table that shows the quantity demanded at
        different prices in the market. A demand curve shows the
        relationship between quantity demanded and price in a given
        market on a graph. The law of demand states that a higher price
        typically leads to a lower quantity demanded.

        A supply schedule is a table that shows the quantity supplied at
        different prices in the market. A supply curve shows the
        relationship between quantity supplied and price on a graph. The
        law of supply says that a higher price typically leads to a
        higher quantity supplied.

        The equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity occur where the
        supply and demand curves cross. The equilibrium occurs where the
        quantity demanded is equal to the quantity supplied. If the
        price is below the equilibrium level, then the quantity demanded
        will exceed the quantity supplied. Excess demand or a shortage
        will exist. If the price is above the equilibrium level, then
        the quantity supplied will exceed the quantity demanded. Excess
        supply or a surplus will exist. In either case, economic
        pressures will push the price toward the equilibrium level.

          

    2.  <a href="#bookmark184" class="a">Shifts in Demand and Supply for Goods and</a>
        [Services](#bookmark184)

        Economists often use the *ceteris paribus* or “other things
        being equal” assumption: while examining the economic impact of
        one event, all other factors remain unchanged for analysis
        purposes. Factors that can shift the demand curve for goods and
        services, causing a different quantity to be demanded at any
        given price, include changes in tastes, population, income,
        prices of substitute or complement goods, and expectations about
        future conditions and prices. Factors that can shift the supply
        curve for goods and services, causing a different quantity to be
        supplied at any given price, include input prices, natural
        conditions, changes in technology, and government taxes,
        regulations, or subsidies.

          

    3.  <a href="#bookmark210" class="a">Changes in Equilibrium Price and Quantity: The Four-Step</a>
        [Process](#bookmark210)

        When using the supply and demand framework to think about how an
        event will affect the equilibrium price and quantity, proceed
        through four steps: (1) sketch a supply and demand diagram to
        think about what the market looked like before the event; (2)
        decide whether the event will affect supply or demand; (3)
        decide whether the effect on supply or demand is negative or
        positive, and draw the appropriate shifted supply or demand
        curve; (4) compare the new equilibrium price and quantity to the
        original ones.

        Price ceilings prevent a price from rising above a certain
        level. When a price ceiling is set below the equilibrium price,
        quantity demanded will exceed quantity supplied, and excess
        demand or shortages will result. Price floors prevent a price
        from falling below a certain level. When a price floor is set
        above the equilibrium price, quantity supplied will exceed
        quantity demanded, and excess supply or surpluses will result.
        Price floors and price ceilings often lead to unintended
        consequences.

        [Efficiency](#bookmark226)

Consumer surplus is the gap between the price that consumers are willing
to pay, based on their preferences, and the market equilibrium price.
Producer surplus is the gap between the price for which producers are
willing to sell a product, based on their costs, and the market
equilibrium price. Social surplus is the sum of consumer surplus and
producer surplus. Total surplus is larger at the equilibrium quantity
and price than it will be at any other quantity and price. Deadweight
loss is loss in total surplus that occurs when the economy produces at
an inefficient quantity.

    Suppose the government decided that, since gasoline is a necessity,
    its price should be legally capped at $1.30 per gallon. What do you
    anticipate would be the outcome in the gasoline market?</span>

37. Explain why the following statement is false: “In the goods market,
    no buyer would be willing to pay more than the equilibrium price.”

38. Explain why the following statement is false: “In the goods market,
    no seller would be willing to sell for less than the equilibrium
    price.”

39. Consider the demand for hamburgers. If the price of a substitute
    good (for example, hot dogs) increases and the price of a complement
    good (for example, hamburger buns) increases, can you tell for sure
    what will happen to the demand for hamburgers? Why or why not?
    Illustrate your answer with a graph.

40. How do you suppose the demographics of an aging population of “Baby
    Boomers” in the United States will affect the demand for milk?
    Justify your answer.

41. We know that a change in the price of a product causes a movement
    along the demand curve. Suppose consumers believe that prices will
    be rising in the future. How will that affect demand for the product
    in the present? Can you show this graphically?

42. Suppose there is a soda tax to curb obesity. What should a reduction
    in the soda tax do to the supply of sodas and to the equilibrium
    price and quantity? Can you show this graphically? *Hint*: Assume
    that the soda tax is collected from the sellers.

Baby Boomers Come of Age

The Census Bureau reports that as of 2013, 20% of the U.S. population
was over 60 years old, which means that almost 63 million people are
reaching an age when they will need increased medical care.

The baby boomer population, the group born between 1946 and 1964, is
comprised of approximately

74 million people who have just reached retirement age. As this
population grows older, they will be faced with common healthcare issues
such as heart conditions, arthritis, and Alzheimer’s that may require
hospitalization, long-term, or at-home nursing care. Aging baby boomers
and advances in life-saving and life- extending technologies will
increase the demand for healthcare and nursing. Additionally, the
Affordable Care Act, which expands access to healthcare for millions of
Americans, has further increase the demand, although with the election
of Donald J. Trump, this increase may not be sustained.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, registered nursing jobs are
expected to increase by 16% between 2014 and 2024. The median annual
wage of $67,490 (in 2015) is also expected to increase. The BLS
forecasts that 439,000 new nurses will be in demand by 2022.

These data tell us, as economists, that the market for healthcare
professionals, and nurses in particular, will face several challenges.
Our study of supply and demand will help us to analyze what might happen
in the

labor market for nursing and other healthcare professionals, as we will
discuss in the second half of this case at the end of the chapter.

  

#### Introduction to Labor and Financial Markets

In this chapter, you will learn about:

-   Demand and Supply at Work in Labor Markets

-   Demand and Supply in Financial Markets

-   The Market System as an Efficient Mechanism for Information

  

The theories of supply and demand do not apply just to markets for
goods. They apply to any market, even markets for things we may not
think of as goods and services like labor and financial services. Labor
markets are markets for employees or jobs. Financial services markets
are markets for saving or borrowing.

When we think about demand and supply curves in goods and services
markets, it is easy to picture the demanders and suppliers: businesses
produce the products and households buy them. Who are the demanders and
suppliers in labor and financial service markets? In labor markets job
seekers (individuals) are the suppliers of labor, while firms and other
employers who hire labor are the demanders for labor. In financial
markets, any individual or firm who saves contributes to the supply of
money, and any who borrows (person, firm, or government) contributes to
the demand for money.

As a college student, you most likely participate in both labor and
financial markets. Employment is a fact of life for most college
students: According to the National Center for Educational Statistics,
in 2013 40% of full-time college students and 76% of part-time college
students were employed. Most college students are also heavily involved
in financial markets, primarily as borrowers. Among full-time students,
about half take out a loan to help finance their education each year,
and those loans average about $6,000 per year. Many students also borrow
for other expenses, like purchasing a car. As this chapter will
illustrate, we can analyze labor markets and financial markets with the
same tools we use to analyze demand and supply in the goods markets.

  

1.  <span id="bookmark292">|</span> <span
    style=" color: #3767B1;">Demand and Supply at Work in Labor
    Markets</span><span id="bookmark298">‌</span>

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Predict shifts in the demand and supply curves of the labor
        market

    -   Explain the impact of new technology on the demand and supply
        curves of the labor market

    -   Explain price floors in the labor market such as minimum wage or
        a living wage

          

        <span id="bookmark299">Markets for labor have demand and supply
        curves, just like markets for goods. The law of demand applies
        in labor markets this way: A higher</span> **salary** or
        **wage**—that is, a higher price in the labor market—leads to a
        decrease in the quantity of labor demanded by employers, while a
        lower salary or wage leads to an increase in the quantity of
        labor demanded. The law of supply functions in labor markets,
        too: A higher price for labor leads to a higher quantity of
        labor supplied; a lower price leads to a lower quantity
        supplied.

        Equilibrium in the Labor Market

        <a href="#bookmark300" class="s34">In 2015, about 35,000 registered nurses worked in the Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington, Minnesota-Wisconsin metropolitan area, according to the BLS. They worked for a variety of employers: hospitals, doctors’ offices, schools, health clinics, and nursing homes.</a>
        <a href="#bookmark300" class="a">Figure 4.2</a>
        <a href="#bookmark301" class="s34">illustrates how demand and supply determine equilibrium in this labor market. The demand and supply schedules in</a>

        <span id="bookmark300">Figure 4.2 Labor Market Example: Demand
        and Supply for Nurses in Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington</span>
        <span class="s37">The demand curve (D) of those employers who
        want to hire nurses intersects with the supply curve (S) of
        those who are qualified and willing to work as nurses at the
        equilibrium point (E). The equilibrium salary is $70,000 and the
        equilibrium quantity is 34,000 nurses. At an above-equilibrium
        salary of $75,000, quantity supplied increases to 38,000, but
        the quantity of nurses demanded at the higher pay declines to
        33,000. At this above-equilibrium salary, an excess supply or
        surplus of nurses would exist. At a below-equilibrium salary of
        $60,000, quantity supplied declines to 27,000, while the
        quantity demanded at the lower wage increases to 40,000 nurses.
        At this below- equilibrium salary, excess demand or a shortage
        exists.</span>

        Table 4.1 Demand and Supply of Nurses in Minneapolis-St.
        Paul-Bloomington

          

        The horizontal axis shows the quantity of nurses hired. In this
        example we measure labor by number of workers, but another
        common way to measure the quantity of labor is by the number of
        hours worked. The vertical axis shows the price for nurses’
        labor—that is, how much they are paid. In the real world, this
        “price” would be total labor compensation: salary plus benefits.
        It is not obvious, but benefits are a significant part (as high
        as 30 percent) of labor compensation. In this example we measure
        the price of labor by salary on an annual basis, although in
        other cases we could measure the price of labor by monthly or
        weekly pay, or even the wage paid per hour. As the salary for
        nurses rises, the quantity demanded will fall. Some hospitals
        and nursing homes may reduce the number of nurses they hire, or
        they may lay off some of their existing nurses, rather than pay
        them higher salaries. Employers who face higher nurses’ salaries
        may also try to replace some nursing functions by investing in
        physical equipment, like computer monitoring and diagnostic
        systems to monitor patients, or by using lower-paid health care
        aides to reduce the number of nurses they need.

        As the salary for nurses rises, the quantity supplied will rise.
        If nurses’ salaries in Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington are
        higher than in other cities, more nurses will move to
        Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington to find jobs, more people will
        be willing to train as nurses, and those currently trained as
        nurses will be more likely to pursue nursing as a full- time
        job. In other words, there will be more nurses looking for jobs
        in the area.

          

          

        <span id="bookmark302">At</span>
        **equilibrium**<a href="#bookmark300" class="s34">, the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded are equal. Thus, every employer who wants to hire a nurse at this equilibrium wage can find a willing worker, and every nurse who wants to work at this equilibrium salary can find a job. In</a>
        <a href="#bookmark300" class="a">Figure</a> <span
        class="s54">4.2</span>, the supply curve (S) and demand
        curve (D) intersect at the equilibrium point (E). The
        equilibrium quantity of nurses in the Minneapolis-St.
        Paul-Bloomington area is 34,000, and the equilibrium salary is
        $70,000 per year. This example simplifies the nursing market by
        focusing on the “average” nurse. In reality, of course, the
        market for nurses actually comprises many smaller markets, like
        markets for nurses with varying degrees of experience and
        credentials. Many markets contain closely related products that
        differ in quality. For instance, even a simple product like
        gasoline comes in regular, premium, and super-premium, each with
        a different price. Even in such cases, discussing the average
        price of gasoline, like the average salary for nurses, can still
        be useful because it reflects what is happening in most of the
        submarkets.

        <span id="bookmark303">When the price of labor is not at the
        equilibrium, economic incentives tend to move salaries toward
        the equilibrium. For example, if salaries for nurses in
        Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington were above the equilibrium at
        $75,000 per year, then 38,000 people want to work as nurses, but
        employers want to hire only 33,000 nurses. At that above-
        equilibrium salary, excess supply or a surplus results. In a
        situation of excess supply in the</span> **labor market**, with
        many applicants for every job opening, employers will have an
        incentive to offer lower wages than they otherwise would have.
        Nurses’ salary will move down toward equilibrium.

        In contrast, if the salary is below the equilibrium at, say,
        $60,000 per year, then a situation of excess demand or a
        shortage arises. In this case, employers encouraged by the
        relatively lower wage want to hire 40,000 nurses, but only
        27,000 individuals want to work as nurses at that salary in
        Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington. In response to the shortage,
        some employers will offer higher pay to attract the nurses.
        Other employers will have to match the higher pay to keep their
        own employees. The higher salaries will encourage more nurses to
        train or work in Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington. Again, price
        and quantity in the labor market will move toward equilibrium.

        Shifts in Labor Demand

        <span id="bookmark304">The demand curve for labor shows the
        quantity of labor employers wish to hire at any given salary or
        wage rate, under the</span> *ceteris paribus* assumption. A
        change in the wage or salary will result in a change in the
        quantity demanded of labor. If the wage rate increases,
        employers will want to hire fewer employees. The quantity of
        labor demanded will decrease, and there will be a movement
        upward along the demand curve. If the wages and salaries
        decrease, employers are more likely to hire a greater number of
        workers. The quantity of labor demanded will increase, resulting
        in a downward movement along the demand curve.

        Shifts in the demand curve for labor occur for many reasons. One
        key reason is that the demand for labor is based on the demand
        for the good or service that is produced. For example, the more
        new automobiles consumers demand, the greater the number of
        workers automakers will need to hire. Therefore the demand for
        labor is called a “derived demand.” Here are some examples of
        derived demand for labor:

    -   The demand for chefs is dependent on the demand for restaurant
        meals.

    -   The demand for pharmacists is dependent on the demand for
        prescription drugs.

    -   The demand for attorneys is dependent on the demand for legal
        services.

    <a href="#bookmark305" class="s34">As the demand for the goods and services increases, the demand for labor will increase, or shift to the right, to meet employers’ production requirements. As the demand for the goods and services decreases, the demand for labor will decrease, or shift to the left.</a>
    <a href="#bookmark305" class="a">Table 4.2</a> <span class="p">shows
    that in addition to the derived demand for labor, demand can also
    increase or decrease (shift) in response to several factors.</span>

    Shifts in Labor Supply

    <a href="#bookmark306" class="s34">The supply of labor is upward-sloping and adheres to the law of supply: The higher the price, the greater the quantity supplied and the lower the price, the less quantity supplied. The supply curve models the tradeoff between supplying labor into the market or using time in leisure activities at every given price level. The higher the wage, the more labor is willing to work and forego leisure activities.</a>

This eventually increases supply of labor when the former reach working age. An aging and therefore retiring population will decrease the supply of labor.

On the other hand, the government may also subsidize training or even reduce the required level of qualifications. For example, government might offer subsidies for nursing schools or nursing students. Such provisions would shift the supply curve of nurses to the right. In addition, government policies that change the relative desirability of working versus not working also affect the labor supply. These include unemployment benefits, maternity leave, child care benefits, and welfare policy. For example, child care benefits may increase the labor supply of working mothers. Long term unemployment benefits may discourage job searching for unemployed workers. All these policies must therefore be carefully designed to minimize any negative labor supply effects.</p></td>

    Table 4.3 Factors that Can Shift Supply

      

      

    A change in salary will lead to a movement along labor demand or
    labor supply curves, but it will not shift those curves. However,
    other events like those we have outlined here will cause either the
    demand or the supply of labor to shift, and thus will move the labor
    market to a new equilibrium salary and quantity.

    Technology and Wage Inequality: The Four-Step Process

    <a href="#bookmark159" class="s34">Economic events can change the equilibrium salary (or wage) and quantity of labor. Consider how the wave of new information technologies, like computer and telecommunications networks, has affected low-skill and high-skill workers in the U.S. economy. From the perspective of employers who demand labor, these new technologies are often a substitute for low-skill laborers like file clerks who used to keep file cabinets full of paper records of transactions. However, the same new technologies are a complement to high-skill workers like managers, who benefit from the technological advances by having the ability to monitor more information, communicate more easily, and juggle a wider array of responsibilities. How will the new technologies affect the wages of high-skill and low-skill workers? For this question, the four-step process of analyzing how shifts in supply or demand affect a market (introduced in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark159" class="a">Demand and</a> Supply<span

    Step 2. Does the new technology affect the supply of labor from
    households or the demand for labor from firms? The technology change
    described here affects demand for labor by firms that hire workers.

    Step 3. Will the new technology increase or decrease demand? Based
    on the description earlier, as the substitute for low-skill labor
    becomes available, demand for low-skill labor will shift to the
    left, from D<span class="s60">0</span> to D<span
    class="s60">1</span>. As the technology complement for high-skill
    labor becomes cheaper, demand for high-skill labor will shift to the
    right, from D<span class="s60">0</span> to D<span
    class="s60">1</span>.

    Step 4. The new equilibrium for low-skill labor, shown as point
    E<span class="s60">1</span> with price W<span class="s60">1</span>
    and quantity Q<span class="s60">1</span>, has a lower wage and
    quantity hired than the original equilibrium, E<span
    class="s60">0</span>. The new equilibrium for high-skill labor,
    shown as point E<span class="s60">1</span> with price W<span
    class="s60">1</span> and quantity Q<span class="s60">1</span>, has a
    higher wage and quantity hired than the original equilibrium (E<span
    class="s60">0</span>).

    Thus, the demand and supply model predicts that the new computer and
    communications technologies will raise the pay of high-skill workers
    but reduce the pay of low-skill workers. From the 1970s to the
    mid-2000s, the wage gap widened between high-skill and low-skill
    labor. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, in
    1980, for example, a college graduate earned about 30% more than a
    high school graduate with comparable job experience, but by 2014, a
    college graduate earned about 66% more than an otherwise comparable
    high school graduate. Many economists believe that the trend toward
    greater wage inequality across the U.S. economy is due to
    improvements in

    Price Floors in the Labor Market: Living Wages and Minimum Wages

    In contrast to goods and services markets, price ceilings are rare
    in labor markets, because rules that prevent people from earning
    income are not politically popular. There is one exception: boards
    of trustees or stockholders, as an example, propose limits on the
    high incomes of top business executives.

    <span id="bookmark308">The labor market, however, presents some
    prominent examples of price floors, which are an attempt to increase
    the wages of low-paid workers. The U.S. government sets a</span>
    **minimum wage**, a price floor that makes it illegal for an
    employer to pay employees less than a certain hourly rate. In
    mid-2009, the U.S. minimum wage was raised to $7.25 per hour. Local
    political movements in a number of U.S. cities have pushed for a
    higher minimum wage, which they call a **living wage**. Promoters of
    living wage laws maintain that the minimum wage is too low to ensure
    a reasonable standard of living. They base this conclusion on the
    calculation that, if you work 40 hours a week at a minimum wage of
    $7.25 per hour for 50 weeks a year, your annual income is $14,500,
    which is less than the official U.S. government definition of what
    it means for a family to be in poverty. (A family with two adults
    earning minimum wage and two young children will find it more cost
    efficient for one parent to provide childcare while the other works
    for income. Thus the family income would be $14,500, which is
    significantly lower than the federal poverty line for a family of
    four, which was $24,250 in 2015.)<span id="bookmark309">‌</span>

    Supporters of the living wage argue that full-time workers should be
    assured a high enough wage so that they can afford the essentials of
    life: food, clothing, shelter, and healthcare. Since Baltimore
    passed the first living wage law in 1994, several dozen cities
    enacted similar laws in the late 1990s and the 2000s. The living
    wage ordinances do not apply to all employers, but they have
    specified that all employees of the city or employees of firms that
    the city hires be paid at least a certain wage that is usually a few
    dollars per hour above the U.S. minimum wage.

    <a href="#bookmark310" class="a">Figure 4.4</a>
    <a href="#bookmark311" class="s34">illustrates the situation of a city considering a living wage law. For simplicity, we assume that there is no federal minimum wage. The wage appears on the vertical axis, because the wage is the price in the labor market. Before the passage of the living wage law, the equilibrium wage is $10 per hour and the city hires 1,200 workers at this wage. However, a group of concerned citizens persuades the city council to enact a living wage law requiring employers to pay no less than $12 per hour. In response to the higher wage, 1,600 workers look for jobs with the city. At this higher wage, the city, as an employer, is willing to hire only 700 workers. At the price floor, the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded, and a surplus of labor exists in this market. For workers who continue to have a job at a higher salary, life has improved. For those who were willing to work at the old wage rate but lost their jobs with the wage increase, life has not improved.</a>

    Table 4.4 Living Wage: Example of a Price Floor

      

    The Minimum Wage as an Example of a Price Floor

    The U.S. minimum wage is a price floor that is set either very close
    to the equilibrium wage or even slightly below it. About 1% of
    American workers are actually paid the minimum wage. In other words,
    the vast majority of the U.S. labor force has its wages determined
    in the labor market, not as a result of the government price floor.
    However, for workers with low skills and little experience, like
    those without a high school diploma or teenagers, the minimum wage
    is quite important. In many cities, the federal minimum wage is
    apparently below the market price for unskilled labor, because
    employers offer more than the minimum wage to checkout clerks and
    other low-skill workers without any government prodding.

    Economists have attempted to estimate how much the minimum wage
    reduces the quantity demanded of low-skill labor. A typical result
    of such studies is that a 10% increase in the minimum wage would
    decrease the hiring of unskilled workers by 1 to 2%, which seems a
    relatively small reduction. In fact, some studies have even found no
    effect of a higher minimum wage on employment at certain times and
    places—although these studies are controversial.

    Let’s suppose that the minimum wage lies just slightly *below* the
    equilibrium wage level. Wages could fluctuate according to market
    forces above this price floor, but they would not be allowed to move
    beneath the floor. In this situation, the price floor minimum wage
    is *nonbinding* —that is, the price floor is not determining the
    market outcome. Even if the minimum wage moves just a little higher,
    it will still have no effect on the quantity of

      

      

    employment in the economy, as long as it remains below the
    equilibrium wage. Even if the government increases minimum wage by
    enough so that it rises slightly above the equilibrium wage and
    becomes binding, there will be only a small excess supply gap
    between the quantity demanded and quantity supplied.

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_095.png" width="624" height="471" alt="image" />

    These insights help to explain why U.S. minimum wage laws have
    historically had only a small impact on employment. Since the
    minimum wage has typically been set close to the equilibrium wage
    for low-skill labor and sometimes even below it, it has not had a
    large effect in creating an excess supply of labor. However, if the
    minimum wage increased dramatically—say, if it doubled to match the
    living wages that some U.S. cities have considered—then its impact
    on reducing the quantity demanded of employment would be far
    greater. As of 2017, many U.S. states are set to increase their
    minimum wage to $15 per hour. We will see what happens. The
    following Clear It Up feature describes in greater detail some of
    the arguments for and against changes to minimum wage.

      

    What’s the harm in raising the minimum wage?

    Because of the law of demand, a higher required wage will reduce the
    amount of low-skill employment either in terms of employees or in
    terms of work hours. Although there is controversy over the numbers,
    let’s say for the sake of the argument that a 10% rise in the
    minimum wage will reduce the employment of low-skill workers by 2%.
    Does this outcome mean that raising the minimum wage by 10% is bad
    public policy? Not necessarily.

    If 98% of those receiving the minimum wage have a pay increase of
    10%, but 2% of those receiving the minimum wage lose their jobs, are
    the gains for society as a whole greater than the losses? The answer
    is not clear, because job losses, even for a small group, may cause
    more pain than modest income gains for others. For one thing, we
    need to consider which minimum wage workers are losing their jobs.
    If the 2% of minimum wage workers who lose their jobs are struggling
    to support families, that is one thing. If those who lose their job
    are high school students picking up spending money over summer
    vacation, that is something else.

    Another complexity is that many minimum wage workers do not work
    full-time for an entire year. Imagine a minimum wage worker who
    holds different part-time jobs for a few months at a time, with
    bouts of unemployment in between. The worker in this situation
    receives the 10% raise in the minimum wage when working, but also
    ends up working 2% fewer hours during the year because the higher
    minimum wage reduces how much employers want people to work.
    Overall, this worker’s income would rise because the 10% pay raise
    would more than offset the 2% fewer hours worked.

    <a href="http://cnx.org/content/m63897/latest/" class="s84">Of course, these arguments do not prove that raising the minimum wage is necessarily a good idea either. There may well be other, better public policy options for helping low-wage workers. (The</a>
    <a href="http://cnx.org/content/m63897/latest/" class="s43">Poverty and Economic Inequality</a>
    (http://cnx.org/content/m63897/latest/) <span class="s37">chapter
    discusses some possibilities.) The lesson from this maze of minimum
    wage arguments is that complex social problems rarely have simple
    answers. Even those who agree on how a proposed economic policy
    affects quantity demanded and quantity supplied may still disagree
    on whether the policy is a good idea.</span>

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Identify the demanders and suppliers in a financial market

    -   Explain how interest rates can affect supply and demand

    -   Analyze the economic effects of U.S. debt in terms of domestic
        financial markets

    -   Explain the role of price ceilings and usury laws in the U.S.

      

    United States' households, institutions, and domestic businesses
    saved almost $1.3 trillion in 2015. Where did that savings go and
    how was it used? Some of the savings ended up in banks, which in
    turn loaned the money to individuals or businesses that wanted to
    borrow money. Some was invested in private companies or loaned to

      

      

    government agencies that wanted to borrow money to raise funds for
    purposes like building roads or mass transit. Some firms reinvested
    their savings in their own businesses.

    <span id="bookmark313">In this section, we will determine how the
    demand and supply model links those who wish to supply</span>
    **financial capital**
    <a href="http://cnx.org/content/m63860/latest/" class="s34">(i.e., savings) with those who demand financial capital (i.e., borrowing). Those who save money (or make financial investments, which is the same thing), whether individuals or businesses, are on the supply side of the financial market. Those who borrow money are on the demand side of the financial market. For a more detailed treatment of the different kinds of financial investments like bank accounts, stocks and bonds, see the</a>

    </span>chapter.

    Who Demands and Who Supplies in Financial Markets?

    In any market, the price is what suppliers receive and what
    demanders pay. In financial markets, those who supply financial
    capital through saving expect to receive a rate of return, while
    those who demand financial capital by receiving funds expect to pay
    a rate of return. This rate of return can come in a variety of
    forms, depending on the type of investment.

    <span id="bookmark314">The simplest example of a rate of return is
    the</span> **interest rate**. For example, when you supply money
    into a savings account at a bank, you receive interest on your
    deposit. The interest the bank pays you as a percent of your
    deposits is the interest rate. Similarly, if you demand a loan to
    buy a car or a computer, you will need to pay interest on the money
    you borrow.

    Let’s consider the market for borrowing money with credit cards. In
    2015, almost 200 million Americans were cardholders. Credit cards
    allow you to borrow money from the card's issuer, and pay back the
    borrowed amount plus interest, although most allow you a period of
    time in which you can repay the loan without paying interest. A
    typical credit card interest rate ranges from 12% to 18% per year.
    In May 2016, Americans had about $943 billion outstanding in credit
    card debts. About half of U.S. families with credit cards report
    that they almost always pay the full balance on time, but
    one-quarter of U.S. families with credit cards say that they “hardly
    ever” pay off the card in full. In fact, in 2014, 56% of consumers
    carried an unpaid balance in the last 12 months. Let’s say that, on
    average, the annual interest rate for credit card borrowing is 15%
    per year. Thus, Americans pay tens of billions of dollars every year
    in interest on their credit cards—plus basic fees for the credit
    card or fees for late payments.

    credit card borrowing, the demand curve (D) for borrowing financial
    capital intersects the supply curve (S) for lending financial

    loaned and borrowed is $600 billion. The equilibrium price is where
    the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied are equal. At an
    above-equilibrium interest rate like 21%, the quantity of financial
    capital supplied would increase to $750 billion, but the quantity
    demanded would decrease to $480 billion. At a below-equilibrium
    interest rate like 13%, the quantity of financial capital demanded
    would increase to $700 billion, but the quantity of financial

    Table 4.5 Demand and Supply for Borrowing Money with Credit Cards

      

    <span id="bookmark317">The laws of demand and supply continue to
    apply in the financial markets. According to the</span> **law of
    demand**, a higher rate of return (that is, a higher price) will
    decrease the quantity demanded. As the interest rate rises,
    consumers will reduce the quantity that they borrow. According to
    the law of supply, a higher price increases the quantity supplied.
    Consequently, as the interest rate paid on credit card borrowing
    rises, more firms will be eager to issue credit cards and to
    encourage customers to use them. Conversely, if the interest rate on
    credit cards falls, the quantity of financial capital supplied in
    the credit card market will decrease and the quantity demanded will
    fall.

    Equilibrium in Financial Markets

    <a href="#bookmark315" class="s34">In the financial market for credit cards in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark315" class="a">Figure</a> 4.5<span class="p">, the
    supply curve (S) and the demand curve (D) cross at the equilibrium
    point (E). The equilibrium occurs at an interest rate of 15%, where
    the quantity of funds demanded and the quantity supplied are equal
    at an equilibrium quantity of $600 billion.</span>

    If the interest rate (remember, this measures the “price” in the
    financial market) is above the equilibrium level, then an excess
    supply, or a surplus, of financial capital will arise in this
    market. For example, at an interest rate of 21%, the quantity of
    funds supplied increases to $750 billion, while the quantity
    demanded decreases to $480 billion. At this

      

      

    above-equilibrium interest rate, firms are eager to supply loans to
    credit card borrowers, but relatively few people or businesses wish
    to borrow. As a result, some credit card firms will lower the
    interest rates (or other fees) they charge to attract more business.
    This strategy will push the interest rate down toward the
    equilibrium level.

    If the interest rate is below the equilibrium, then excess demand or
    a shortage of funds occurs in this market. At an interest rate of
    13%, the quantity of funds credit card borrowers demand increases to
    $700 billion, but the quantity credit card firms are willing to
    supply is only $510 billion. In this situation, credit card firms
    will perceive that they are overloaded with eager borrowers and
    conclude that they have an opportunity to raise interest rates or
    fees. The interest rate will face economic pressures to creep up
    toward the equilibrium level.

    <a href="https://openstax.org/l/FRED_stlouis" class="s34">The FRED database publishes some two dozen measures of interest rates, including interest rates on credit cards, automobile loans, personal loans, mortgage loans, and more. You can find these at the FRED</a>

    Shifts in Demand and Supply in Financial Markets

    Those who supply financial capital face two broad decisions: how
    much to save, and how to divide up their savings among different
    forms of financial investments. We will discuss each of these in
    turn.

    <span id="bookmark318">Participants in financial markets must decide
    when they prefer to consume goods: now or in the future. Economists
    call this</span> **intertemporal decision making** because it
    involves decisions across time. Unlike a decision about what to buy
    from the grocery store, people make investment or savings decisions
    across a period of time, sometimes a long period.

    Most workers save for retirement because their income in the present
    is greater than their needs, while the opposite will be true once
    they retire. Thus, they save today and supply financial markets. If
    their income increases, they save more. If their perceived situation
    in the future changes, they change the amount of their saving. For
    example, there is some evidence that Social Security, the program
    that workers pay into in order to qualify for government checks
    after retirement, has tended to reduce the quantity of financial
    capital that workers save. If this is true, Social Security has
    shifted the supply of financial capital at any interest rate to the
    left.

    By contrast, many college students need money today when their
    income is low (or nonexistent) to pay their college expenses. As a
    result, they borrow today and demand from financial markets. Once
    they graduate and become employed, they will pay back the loans.
    Individuals borrow money to purchase homes or cars. A business seeks
    financial investment so that it has the funds to build a factory or
    invest in a research and development project that will not pay off
    for five years, ten years, or even more. Thus, when consumers and
    businesses have greater confidence that they will be able to repay
    in the future, the quantity demanded of financial capital at any
    given interest rate will shift to the right.

    For example, in the technology boom of the late 1990s, many
    businesses became extremely confident that investments in new
    technology would have a high rate of return, and their demand for
    financial capital shifted to the right. Conversely, during the 2008
    and 2009 Great Recession, their demand for financial capital at any
    given interest rate shifted to the left.

    To this point, we have been looking at saving in total. Now let us
    consider what affects saving in different types of financial
    investments. In deciding between different forms of financial
    investments, suppliers of financial capital will have to consider
    the rates of return and the risks involved. Rate of return is a
    positive attribute of investments, but risk is a negative. If
    Investment A becomes more risky, or the return diminishes, then
    savers will shift their funds to Investment B—and the supply curve
    of financial capital for Investment A will shift back to the left
    while the supply curve of capital for Investment B shifts to the
    right.

    The United States as a Global Borrower

    In the global economy, trillions of dollars of financial investment
    cross national borders every year. In the early 2000s, financial
    investors from foreign countries were investing several hundred
    billion dollars per year more in the

    U.S. economy than U.S. financial investors were investing abroad.
    The following Work It Out deals with one of the macroeconomic
    concerns for the U.S. economy in recent years.

      

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_097.png" width="624" height="675" alt="image" />

    The Effect of Growing U.S. Debt

    Imagine that foreign investors viewed the U.S. economy as a less
    desirable place to put their money because of fears about the growth
    of the U.S. public debt. Using the four-step process for analyzing
    how changes in supply and demand affect equilibrium outcomes, how
    would increased U.S. public debt affect the equilibrium price and
    quantity for capital in U.S. financial markets?

    <a href="#bookmark319" class="s84">Step 1. Draw a diagram showing demand and supply for financial capital that represents the original scenario in which foreign investors are pouring money into the U.S. economy.</a>
    <a href="#bookmark319" class="s43">Figure 4.6</a><span class="s36">
    </span>shows a demand curve, D, and a supply curve, S, where the
    supply of capital includes the funds arriving from foreign
    investors. The original equilibrium E<span class="s63">0</span>
    occurs at interest rate R<span class="s63">0</span> and quantity of
    financial investment Q<span class="s63">0</span>.

      

    <span id="bookmark319"><span class="s46">Figure 4.6 The United
    States as a Global Borrower Before U.S. Debt Uncertainty
    </span></span>The graph shows the demand for financial capital from
    and supply of financial capital into the U.S. financial markets by
    the foreign sector before the increase in uncertainty regarding U.S.
    public debt. The original equilibrium (E<span class="s63">0</span>)
    occurs at an equilibrium rate of return (R<span
    class="s63">0</span>) and the equilibrium quantity is at Q<span
    class="s63">0</span>.

    Step 2. Will the diminished confidence in the U.S. economy as a
    place to invest affect demand or supply of financial capital? Yes,
    it will affect supply. Many foreign investors look to the U.S.
    financial markets to store their money in safe financial vehicles
    with low risk and stable returns. Diminished confidence means U.S.
    financial assets will be seen as more risky.

    <a href="#bookmark320" class="s84">Step 3. Will supply increase or decrease? When the enthusiasm of foreign investors’ for investing their money in the U.S. economy diminishes, the supply of financial capital shifts to the left.</a>
    <a href="#bookmark320" class="s43">Figure 4.7</a><span class="s36">
    </span>shows the supply curve shift from S<span class="s63">0</span>
    to S<span class="s63">1</span>.

      

      

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_098.png" width="624" height="390" alt="image" />

      

    <span class="s46">Figure 4.7 The United States as a Global Borrower
    Before and After U.S. Debt Uncertainty </span>The graph shows the
    demand for financial capital and supply of financial capital into
    the U.S. financial markets by the foreign sector before and after
    the increase in uncertainty regarding U.S. public debt. The original
    equilibrium (E<span class="s63">0</span>) occurs at an equilibrium
    rate of return (R<span class="s63">0</span>) and the equilibrium
    quantity is at Q<span class="s63">0</span>.

    Step 4. Thus, foreign investors’ diminished enthusiasm leads to a
    new equilibrium, E<span class="s63">1</span>, which occurs at the
    higher interest rate, R<span class="s63">1</span>, and the lower
    quantity of financial investment, Q<span class="s63">1</span>. In
    short, U.S. borrowers will have to pay more interest on their
    borrowing.

    <span id="bookmark320">The economy has experienced an enormous
    inflow of foreign capital. According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic
    Analysis, by the third quarter of 2015, U.S. investors had
    accumulated $23.3 trillion of foreign assets, but foreign investors
    owned a total of $30.6 trillion of U.S. assets. If foreign investors
    were to pull their money out of the U.S. economy and invest
    elsewhere in the world, the result could be a significantly lower
    quantity of financial investment in the United States, available
    only at a higher interest rate. This reduced inflow of foreign
    financial investment could impose hardship on U.S. consumers and
    firms interested in borrowing.</span>

    In a modern, developed economy, financial capital often moves
    invisibly through electronic transfers between one bank account and
    another. Yet we can analyze these flows of funds with the same tools
    of demand and supply as markets for goods or labor.

    Price Ceilings in Financial Markets: Usury Laws

    As we noted earlier, about 200 million Americans own credit cards,
    and their interest payments and fees total tens of billions of
    dollars each year. It is little wonder that political pressures
    sometimes arise for setting limits on the interest rates or fees
    that credit card companies charge. The firms that issue credit
    cards, including banks, oil companies, phone companies, and retail
    stores, respond that the higher interest rates are necessary to
    cover the losses created by those who borrow on their credit cards
    and who do not repay on time or at all. These companies also point
    out that cardholders can avoid paying interest if they pay their
    bills on time.

    <a href="#bookmark321" class="s34">Consider the credit card market as</a>
    <a href="#bookmark321" class="a">Figure 4.8</a><span class="s54">
    </span>illustrators. In this financial market, the vertical axis
    shows the interest rate (which is the price in the financial
    market). Demanders in the credit card market are households and
    businesses. Suppliers are the companies that issue credit cards.
    This figure does not use specific numbers, which would be
    hypothetical in any case, but instead focuses on the underlying
    economic relationships. Imagine a law imposes a price ceiling that
    holds the interest rate charged on credit cards at the rate Rc,
    which lies below the interest rate R<span class="s60">0</span> that
    would otherwise have prevailed in the market. The horizontal dashed
    line at interest rate R<span class="s60">c</span>
    <a href="#bookmark321" class="s34">in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark321" class="a">Figure 4.8</a><span class="s54">
    </span>shows the price ceiling. The demand and supply model predicts
    that at the lower price ceiling interest rate, the quantity demanded
    of credit card debt will increase from its original level of Q<span
    class="s60">0</span> to Qd; however, the quantity supplied of credit
    card debt will decrease from the original Q<span
    class="s60">0</span> to Qs. At the price ceiling (Rc), quantity
    demanded will exceed quantity supplied. Consequently, a number of
    people who want to have credit cards and are willing to pay the
    prevailing interest rate will find that companies are unwilling to
    issue cards to them. The result will be a credit shortage.

    <span id="bookmark321"><span class="s36">Figure 4.8 Credit Card
    Interest Rates: Another Price Ceiling Example </span></span>The
    original intersection of demand D and supply S occurs at equilibrium
    E<span class="s63">0</span>. However, a price ceiling is set at the
    interest rate Rc, below the equilibrium interest rate R<span
    class="s63">0</span>, and so the interest rate cannot adjust upward
    to the equilibrium. At the price ceiling, the quantity demanded, Qd,
    exceeds the quantity supplied, Qs. There is excess demand, also
    called a shortage.

      

    <span id="bookmark322">Many states do have</span> **usury laws**,
    which impose an upper limit on the interest rate that lenders can
    charge. However, in many cases these upper limits are well above the
    market interest rate. For example, if the interest rate is not
    allowed to rise above 30% per year, it can still fluctuate below
    that level according to market forces. A price ceiling that is set
    at a relatively high level is nonbinding, and it will have no
    practical effect unless the equilibrium price soars high enough to
    exceed the price ceiling.

    Why are demand and supply curves important?

    <a href="#bookmark96" class="s84">The demand and supply model is the second fundamental diagram for this course. (The opportunity set model that we introduced in the</a>
    Choice in a World of Scarcity <span class="s37">chapter was the
    first.) Just as it would be foolish to try to learn the arithmetic
    of long division by memorizing every possible combination of numbers
    that can be divided by each other, it would be foolish to try to
    memorize every specific example of demand and supply in this
    chapter, this textbook, or this course. Demand and supply is not
    primarily a list of examples. It is a</span>

    <span id="bookmark324">Prices exist in markets for goods and
    services, for labor, and for financial capital. In all of these
    markets, prices serve as a remarkable social mechanism for
    collecting, combining, and transmitting information that is relevant
    to the market—namely, the relationship between demand and supply—and
    then serving as messengers to convey that information to buyers and
    sellers. In a market-oriented economy, no government agency or
    guiding intelligence oversees the set of responses and
    interconnections that result from a change in price. Instead, each
    consumer reacts according to that person’s preferences and budget
    set, and each profit-seeking producer reacts to the impact on its
    expected profits. The following Clear It Up feature examines
    the</span> **demand and supply models**.

      

      

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_101.png" width="624" height="718" alt="image" />

    model to analyze prices and quantities. Even though demand and
    supply diagrams have many labels, they are fundamentally the same in
    their logic. Your goal should be to understand the underlying model
    so you can use it to analyze *any* market.

    <a href="#bookmark325" class="s43">Figure 4.9</a> <span
    class="s37">displays a generic demand and supply curve. The
    horizontal axis shows the different measures of quantity: a quantity
    of a good or service, or a quantity of labor for a given job, or a
    quantity of financial capital. The vertical axis shows a measure of
    price: the price of a good or service, the wage in the labor market,
    or the rate of return (like the interest rate) in the financial
    market.</span>

    The demand and supply model can explain the existing levels of
    prices, wages, and rates of return. To carry out such an analysis,
    think about the quantity that will be demanded at each price and the
    quantity that will be supplied at each price—that is, think about
    the shape of the demand and supply curves—and how these forces will
    combine to produce equilibrium.

    We can also use demand and supply to explain how economic events
    will cause changes in prices, wages, and rates of return. There are
    only four possibilities: the change in any single event may cause
    the demand curve to shift right or to shift left, or it may cause
    the supply curve to shift right or to shift left. The key to
    analyzing the effect of an economic event on equilibrium prices and
    quantities is to determine which of these four possibilities
    occurred. The way to do this correctly is to think back to the list
    of factors that shift the demand and supply curves. Note that if
    more than one variable is changing at the same time, the overall
    impact will depend on the degree of the shifts. When there are
    multiple variables, economists isolate each change and analyze it
    independently.

    how economic events will cause changes in prices, wages, and rates
    of return.</span>

      

    An increase in the price of some product signals consumers that
    there is a shortage; therefore, they may want to economize on buying
    this product. For example, if you are thinking about taking a plane
    trip to Hawaii, but the ticket turns out to be expensive during the
    week you intend to go, you might consider other weeks when the
    ticket might be cheaper. The price could be high because you were
    planning to travel during a holiday when demand for traveling is
    high. Maybe the cost of an input like jet fuel increased or the
    airline has raised the price temporarily to see how many people are
    willing to pay it. Perhaps all of these factors are present at the
    same time. You do not need to analyze the market and break down the
    price change into its underlying factors. You just have to look at
    the ticket price and decide whether and when to fly.

    In the same way, price changes provide useful information to
    producers. Imagine the situation of a farmer who grows

      

      

    oats and learns that the price of oats has risen. The higher price
    could be due to an increase in demand caused by a new scientific
    study proclaiming that eating oats is especially healthful. Perhaps
    the price of a substitute grain, like corn, has risen, and people
    have responded by buying more oats. The oat farmer does not need to
    know the details. The farmer only needs to know that the price of
    oats has risen and that it will be profitable to expand production
    as a result.

    <span id="bookmark326">The actions of individual consumers and
    producers as they react to prices overlap and interlock in markets
    for goods, labor, and financial capital. A change in any single
    market is transmitted through these multiple interconnections to
    other markets. The vision of the role of flexible prices helping
    markets to reach equilibrium and linking different markets together
    helps to explain why price controls can be so counterproductive.
    Price controls are government laws that serve to regulate prices
    rather than allow the various markets to determine prices. There is
    an old proverb: “Don’t kill the messenger.” In ancient times,
    messengers carried information between distant cities and kingdoms.
    When they brought bad news, there was an emotional impulse to kill
    the messenger. However, killing the messenger did not kill the bad
    news. Moreover, killing the messenger had an undesirable side
    effect: Other messengers would refuse to bring news to that city or
    kingdom, depriving its citizens of vital information.</span>

    Baby Boomers Come of Age

    <a href="#bookmark327" class="s84">The theory of supply and demand can explain what happens in the labor markets and suggests that the demand for nurses will increase as healthcare needs of baby boomers increase, as</a>
    <span class="s36">Figure 4.10 </span>shows. The impact of that
    increase will result in an average salary higher than the $67,490
    earned in 2015 referenced in the first part of this case. The new
    equilibrium (E<span class="s63">1</span>) will be at the new
    equilibrium price (Pe<span class="s63">1</span>).Equilibrium
    quantity will also increase from Qe<span class="s63">0</span> to
    Qe<span class="s63">1</span>.

    Those who seek price controls are trying to kill the messenger—or at
    least to stifle an unwelcome message that prices are bringing about
    the equilibrium level of price and quantity. However, price controls
    do nothing to affect the underlying forces of demand and supply, and
    this can have serious repercussions. During China’s “Great Leap
    Forward” in the late 1950s, the government kept food prices
    artificially low, with the result that 30 to 40 million people died
    of starvation because the low prices depressed farm production. This
    was communist party leader Mao Zedong's social and economic campaign
    to rapidly transform the country from an agrarian economy to a
    socialist society through rapid industrialization and
    collectivization. Changes in demand and supply will continue to
    reveal themselves through consumers’ and producers’ behavior.
    Immobilizing the price messenger through price controls will deprive
    everyone in the economy of critical information. Without this
    information, it becomes difficult for everyone—buyers and sellers
    alike—to react in a flexible and appropriate manner as changes occur
    throughout the economy.

    KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY

      

    1.  <a href="#bookmark298" class="a">Demand and Supply at Work in Labor</a>
        [Markets](#bookmark298)

        In the labor market, households are on the supply side of the
        market and firms are on the demand side. In the market for
        financial capital, households and firms can be on either side of
        the market: they are suppliers of financial capital when they
        save or make financial investments, and demanders of financial
        capital when they borrow or receive financial investments.

        In the demand and supply analysis of labor markets, we can
        measure the price by the annual salary or hourly wage received.
        We can measure the quantity of labor various ways, like number
        of workers or the number of hours worked.

        Factors that can shift the demand curve for labor include: a
        change in the quantity demanded of the product that the labor
        produces; a change in the production process that uses more or
        less labor; and a change in government policy that affects the
        quantity of labor that firms wish to hire at a given wage.
        Demand can also increase or decrease (shift) in response to:
        workers’ level of education and training, technology, the number
        of companies, and availability and price of other inputs.

        The main factors that can shift the supply curve for labor are:
        how desirable a job appears to workers relative to the
        alternatives, government policy that either restricts or
        encourages the quantity of workers trained for the job, the
        number of workers in the economy, and required education.

          

    2.  <a href="#bookmark312" class="a">Demand and Supply in Financial</a>
        [Markets](#bookmark312)

        In the demand and supply analysis of financial markets, the
        “price” is the rate of return or the interest rate received. We
        measure the quantity by the money that flows from those who
        supply financial capital to those who demand it.

        Two factors can shift the supply of financial capital to a
        certain investment: if people want to alter their existing
        levels of consumption, and if the riskiness or return on one
        investment changes relative to other investments. Factors that
        can shift demand for capital include business confidence and
        consumer confidence in the future—since financial investments
        received in the present are typically repaid in the future.

          

    3.  <a href="#bookmark323" class="a">The Market System as an Efficient Mechanism for</a>
        [Information](#bookmark323)

The market price system provides a highly efficient mechanism for
disseminating information about relative scarcities of goods, services,
labor, and financial capital. Market participants do not need to know
why prices have changed, only that the changes require them to revisit
previous decisions they made about supply and demand. Price controls
hide information about the true scarcity of products and thereby cause
misallocation of resources.

    CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS

      

    1.  Other than the demand for labor, what would be another example
        of a “derived demand?”

    2.  Suppose that a 5% increase in the minimum wage causes a 5%
        reduction in employment. How would this affect employers and how
        would it affect workers? In your opinion, would this be a good
        policy?

    3.  Under what circumstances would a minimum wage be a nonbinding
        price floor? Under what circumstances would a living wage be a
        binding price floor?

    4.  Suppose the U.S. economy began to grow more rapidly than other
        countries in the world. What would be the likely impact on U.S.
        financial markets as part of the global economy?

    5.  If the government imposed a federal interest rate ceiling of 20%
        on all loans, who would gain and who would lose?

    6.  Why are the factors that shift the demand for a product
        different from the factors that shift the demand for labor? Why
        are the factors that shift the supply of a product different
        from those that shift the supply of labor?

20. Whether the product market or the labor market, what happens to the
    equilibrium price and quantity for each of the four possibilities:
    increase in demand, decrease in demand, increase in supply, and
    decrease in supply.

  

1.  During a discussion several years ago on building a pipeline to
    Alaska to carry natural gas, the U.S. Senate passed a bill
    stipulating that there should be a guaranteed minimum price for the
    natural gas that would flow through the pipeline. The thinking
    behind the bill was that if private firms had a guaranteed price for
    their natural gas, they would be more willing to drill for gas and
    to pay to build the pipeline.

    1.  Using the demand and supply framework, predict the effects of
        this price floor on the price, quantity demanded, and quantity
        supplied.

    2.  With the enactment of this price floor for natural gas, what are
        some of the likely unintended consequences in the market?

    3.  Suggest some policies other than the price floor that the
        government can pursue if it wishes to encourage drilling for
        natural gas and for a new pipeline in Alaska.

          

        PROBLEMS

2.  Identify each of the following as involving either demand or supply.
    Draw a circular flow diagram and label the flows A through F. (Some
    choices can be on both sides of the goods market.)

    1.  Households in the labor market

    2.  Firms in the goods market

    3.  Firms in the financial market

    4.  Households in the goods market

    5.  Firms in the labor market

    6.  Households in the financial market

          

3.  Predict how each of the following events will raise or lower the
    equilibrium wage and quantity of oil workers in Texas. In each case,
    sketch a demand and supply diagram to illustrate your answer.

    1.  The price of oil rises.

    2.  New oil-drilling equipment is invented that is cheap and
        requires few workers to run.

    3.  Several major companies that do not drill oil open factories in
        Texas, offering many well-paid jobs outside the oil industry.

    4.  Government imposes costly new regulations to make oil-drilling a
        safer job.

          

4.  Predict how each of the following economic changes will affect the
    equilibrium price and quantity in the financial market for home
    loans. Sketch a demand and supply diagram to support your answers.

    1.  The number of people at the most common ages for home-buying
        increases.

    2.  People gain confidence that the economy is growing and that
        their jobs are secure.

    3.  Banks that have made home loans find that a larger number of
        people than they expected are not repaying those loans.

    4.  Because of a threat of a war, people become uncertain about
        their economic future.

    5.  The overall level of saving in the economy diminishes.

    6.  The federal government changes its bank regulations in a way
        that makes it cheaper and easier for banks to make home loans.

5.  <a href="#bookmark344" class="a">Table</a> 4.6 <span class="p">shows
    the amount of savings and borrowing in a market for loans to
    purchase homes, measured in millions of dollars, at various interest
    rates. What is the equilibrium interest rate and quantity in the
    capital financial market? How can you tell? Now, imagine that
    because of a shift in the perceptions of foreign investors, the
    supply curve shifts so that there will be $10 million less supplied
    at every interest rate. Calculate the new equilibrium interest rate
    and quantity, and explain why the direction of the interest rate
    shift makes intuitive sense.</span>

That Will Be How Much?

Imagine going to your favorite coffee shop and having the waiter inform
you the pricing has changed. Instead of $3 for a cup of coffee, you will
now be charged $2 for coffee, $1 for creamer, and $1 for your choice of
sweetener. If you pay your usual $3 for a cup of coffee, you must choose
between creamer and sweetener. If you want both, you now face an extra
charge of $1. Sound absurd? Well, that is similar to the situation
Netflix customers found themselves in—they faced a 60% price hike to
retain the same service in 2011.

In early 2011, Netflix consumers paid about $10 a month for a package
consisting of streaming video and DVD rentals. In July 2011, the company
announced a packaging change. Customers wishing to retain both streaming
video and DVD rental would be charged $15.98 per month, a price increase
of about 60%. In 2014, Netflix also raised its streaming video
subscription price from $7.99 to $8.99 per month for new U.S. customers.
The company also changed its policy of 4K streaming content from $9.00
to $12.00 per month that year.

  

How would customers of the 18-year-old firm react? Would they abandon
Netflix? Would the ease of access to other venues make a difference in
how consumers responded to the Netflix price change? We will explore the
answers to those questions in this chapter, which focuses on the change
in quantity with respect to a change in price, a concept economists call
elasticity.

  

#### Introduction to Elasticity

In this chapter, you will learn about:

-   Price Elasticity of Demand and Price Elasticity of Supply

-   Polar Cases of Elasticity and Constant Elasticity

-   Elasticity and Pricing

-   Elasticity in Areas Other Than Price

  

Anyone who has studied economics knows the law of demand: a higher price
will lead to a lower quantity demanded. What you may not know is how
much lower the quantity demanded will be. Similarly, the law of supply
states that a higher price will lead to a higher quantity supplied. The
question is: How much higher? This chapter will explain how to answer
these questions and why they are critically important in the real world.

<span id="bookmark352">To find answers to these questions, we need to
understand the concept of elasticity.</span> **Elasticity** is an
economics concept that measures responsiveness of one variable to
changes in another variable. Suppose you drop two items from a
second-floor balcony. The first item is a tennis ball. The second item
is a brick. Which will bounce higher? Obviously, the tennis ball. We
would say that the tennis ball has greater elasticity.

Consider an economic example. Cigarette taxes are an example of a “sin
tax,” a tax on something that is bad for you, like alcohol. Governments
tax cigarettes at the state and national levels. State taxes range from
a low of 17 cents per pack in Missouri to $4.35 per pack in New York.
The average state cigarette tax is $1.69 per pack. The 2014 federal tax
rate on cigarettes was $1.01 per pack, but in 2015 the Obama
Administration proposed raising the federal tax nearly a dollar to $1.95
per pack. The key question is: How much would cigarette purchases
decline?

Taxes on cigarettes serve two purposes: to raise tax revenue for
government and to discourage cigarette consumption. However, if a higher
cigarette tax discourages consumption considerably, meaning a greatly
reduced quantity of cigarette sales, then the cigarette tax on each pack
will not raise much revenue for the government. Alternatively, a higher
cigarette tax that does not discourage consumption by much will actually
raise more tax revenue for the government. Thus, when a government
agency tries to calculate the effects of altering its cigarette tax, it
must analyze how much the tax affects the quantity of cigarettes
consumed. This issue reaches beyond governments and taxes. Every firm
faces a similar issue. When a firm considers raising the sales price, it
must consider how much a price increase will reduce the quantity
demanded of what it sells. Conversely, when a firm puts its products on
sale, it must expect (or hope) that the lower price will lead to a
significantly higher quantity demanded.

    <span id="bookmark354">Both the demand and supply curve show the
    relationship between price and the number of units demanded or

    demand** is the percentage change in the quantity *demanded* of a
    good or service divided by the percentage change in the price. The

    To calculate elasticity along a demand or supply curve economists
    use the average percent change in both quantity and price. This is
    called the Midpoint Method for Elasticity, and is represented in the
    following equations:

    % change in quantity =

    <span class="s69">⎛ </span>Q<span class="s55">2 </span>– Q<span
    class="s55">1</span><span class="s69">⎞</span>

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_107.png" width="65" height="1" alt="image" />

    <span class="s70">⎝</span>Q<span class="s55">2</span><span
    class="s56"> </span>+ Q<span class="s55">1</span><span
    class="s70">⎠</span>/2

    × 100

    % change in price =

    <span class="s69">⎛ </span>P<span class="s55">2 </span>– P<span
    class="s55">1</span><span class="s69">⎞</span>

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_108.png" width="60" height="1" alt="image" />

    <span class="s70">⎝</span>P<span class="s55">2</span><span
    class="s56"> </span>+ P<span class="s55">1</span><span
    class="s70">⎠</span>/2

    × 100

    <span id="bookmark362">The advantage of the Midpoint Method is that
    one obtains the same elasticity between two price points whether
    there is a price increase or decrease. This is because the formula
    uses the same base (average quantity and average price) for both
    cases.</span>

    Calculating Price Elasticity of Demand

    <a href="#bookmark363" class="s34">Let’s calculate the elasticity between points A and B and between points G and H as</a>
    <a href="#bookmark363" class="a">Figure 5.2</a> <span
    class="p">shows.</span>

    <span id="bookmark363">Figure 5.2 Calculating the Price Elasticity
    of Demand</span> <span class="s37">We calculate the price elasticity
    of demand as the percentage change in quantity divided by the
    percentage change in price.</span>

      

    First, apply the formula to calculate the elasticity as price
    decreases from $70 at point B to $60 at point A:

    % change in quantity =

    3,000 – 2,800

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_110.png" width="96" height="1" alt="image" />

    (3,000 + 2,800)/2

    × 100

    = × 100

    200  

    2,900

    = 6.9

    % change in price =

    60 – 70

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_111.png" width="63" height="1" alt="image" />

    (

    60 + 70)/2

    × 100

    65

    = <u>–10</u><span class="s73"> </span>× 100

    = –15.4

    –15.4%

    Price Elasticity of Demand = <u>     6.9%</u>

    = 0.45

    Therefore, the elasticity of demand between these two points is
    <u>     </u><span class="s74">6.9%</span>

    –15.4%

      

    which is 0.45, an amount smaller than one,

    showing that the demand is inelastic in this interval. Price
    elasticities of demand are *always* negative since price and
    quantity demanded always move in opposite directions (on the demand
    curve). By convention, we always talk about elasticities as positive
    numbers. Mathematically, we take the absolute value of the result.
    We will ignore this detail from now on, while remembering to
    interpret elasticities as positive numbers.

    This means that, along the demand curve between point B and A, if
    the price changes by 1%, the quantity demanded will change by 0.45%.
    A change in the price will result in a smaller percentage change in
    the quantity demanded. For example, a 10% *increase* in the price
    will result in only a 4.5% *decrease* in quantity demanded. A 10%
    *decrease* in the price will result in only a 4.5% *increase* in the
    quantity demanded. Price elasticities of demand are negative numbers
    indicating that the demand curve is downward sloping, but we read
    them as absolute values. The following Work It Out feature will walk
    you through calculating the price elasticity of demand.

    Finding the Price Elasticity of Demand

    <a href="#bookmark363" class="s84">Calculate the price elasticity of demand using the data in</a>
    Figure 5.2 <span class="s37">for an increase in price from G to H.
    Has the elasticity increased or decreased?</span>

    Step 1. We know that:

    % change in price

    Price Elasticity of Demand = <u>% change in quantity</u>

      

    <span id="bookmark364">Step 2. From the Midpoint Formula we know
    that:</span>

      

    % change in quantity =

      

    <span class="s69">⎛ </span>Q<span class="s55">2</span><span
    class="s56"> </span>– Q<span class="s55">1</span>

    <span class="s70">⎝</span>Q<span class="s55">2</span><span
    class="s56"> </span>+ Q<span class="s55">1</span>)/2

      

    × 100

    % change in price =

    <span class="s69">⎛ </span>P<span class="s55">2</span><span
    class="s56"> </span>– P<span class="s55">1</span>

    <span class="s70">⎝</span>P<span class="s55">2</span><span
    class="s56"> </span>+ P<span class="s55">1</span>)/2

    × 100

    Step 3. So we can use the values provided in the figure in each
    equation:

    % change in quantity =

    1,600 – 1,800

    ⎝

    ⎛<span class="s16">1,600 + 1,800)/2</span>

    × 100

    = × 100

    –200

    1,700

    = –11.76

    % change in price =

    130 – 120

    (

    130 + 120)/2

    × 100

    =

    10

    125

    = 8.0

    × 100

    Step 4. Then, we can use those values to determine the price
    elasticity of demand:

    % change in price

    Price Elasticity of Demand = <span class="s79">% change in
    quantity</span>

    =

    –11.76

    8

    = 1.47

    <span id="bookmark365">Therefore, the elasticity of demand from G to
    is H 1.47. The magnitude of the elasticity has increased (in
    absolute value) as we moved up along the demand curve from points A
    to B. Recall that the elasticity between these two points was 0.45.
    Demand was inelastic between points A and B and elastic between
    points G and H. This shows us that price elasticity of demand
    changes at different points along a straight-line demand
    curve.</span><span id="bookmark366">‌</span>

    = 3.53

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_116.png" width="624" height="51" alt="image" />

    Is the elasticity the slope?

    <a href="#bookmark363" class="s84">It is a common mistake to confuse the slope of either the supply or demand curve with its elasticity. The slope is the rate of change in units along the curve, or the rise/run (change in y over the change in x). For example, in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark363" class="s43">Figure</a> <span
    class="s36">5.2</span>, at each point shown on the demand curve,
    price drops by $10 and the number of units demanded increases by 200
    compared to the point to its left. The slope is –10/200 along the
    entire demand curve and does not change. The price elasticity,
    however, changes along the curve. Elasticity between points A and B
    was 0.45 and increased to 1.47 between points G and H. Elasticity is
    the *percentage* change, which is a different calculation from the
    slope and has a different meaning.

    When we are at the upper end of a demand curve, where price is high
    and the quantity demanded is low, a small change in the quantity
    demanded, even in, say, one unit, is pretty big in percentage terms.
    A change

    Again, as with the elasticity of demand, the elasticity of supply is
    not followed by any units. Elasticity is a ratio of one percentage
    change to another percentage change—nothing more—and we read it as
    an absolute value. In this case, a 1% rise in price causes an
    increase in quantity supplied of 3.5%. The greater than one
    elasticity of supply means that the percentage change in quantity
    supplied will be greater than a one percent price change. If you're
    starting to wonder if the concept of slope fits into this
    calculation, read the following Clear It Up box.

      

      

    in price of, say, a dollar, is going to be much less important in
    percentage terms than it would have been at the bottom of the demand
    curve. Likewise, at the bottom of the demand curve, that one unit
    change when the quantity demanded is high will be small as a
    percentage.

    Thus, at one end of the demand curve, where we have a large
    percentage change in quantity demanded over a small percentage
    change in price, the elasticity value would be high, or demand would
    be relatively elastic. Even with the same change in the price and
    the same change in the quantity demanded, at the other end of the
    demand curve the quantity is much higher, and the price is much
    lower, so the percentage change in quantity demanded is smaller and
    the percentage change in price is much higher. That means at the
    bottom of the curve we'd have a small numerator over a large
    denominator, so the elasticity measure would be much lower, or
    inelastic.

    As we move along the demand curve, the values for quantity and price
    go up or down, depending on which way we are moving, so the
    percentages for, say, a $1 difference in price or a one unit
    difference in quantity, will change as well, which means the ratios
    of those percentages and hence the elasticity will change.

      

2.  <span id="bookmark347">|</span> <span style=" color: #3767B1;">Polar
    Cases of Elasticity and Constant Elasticity</span><span
    id="bookmark369">‌</span>

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Differentiate between infinite and zero elasticity

    -   Analyze graphs in order to classify elasticity as constant
        unitary, infinite, or zero

      

    <span id="bookmark370">There are two extreme cases of elasticity:
    when elasticity equals zero and when it is infinite. A third case is
    that of constant unitary elasticity. We will describe each
    case.</span> **Infinite elasticity** or **perfect elasticity**
    <a href="#bookmark372" class="s34">refers to the extreme case where either the quantity demanded (Qd) or supplied (Qs) changes by an infinite amount in response to any change in price at all. In both cases, the supply and the demand curve are horizontal as</a>
    <a href="#bookmark372" class="a">Figure 5.4</a><span class="s54">
    </span>shows. While perfectly elastic supply curves are for the most
    part unrealistic, goods with readily available inputs and whose
    production can easily expand will feature highly elastic supply
    curves. Examples include pizza, bread, books, and pencils.
    Similarly, perfectly elastic demand is an extreme example. However,
    luxury goods, items that take a large share of individuals’ income,
    and goods with many substitutes are likely to have highly elastic
    demand curves. Examples of such goods are Caribbean cruises and
    sports vehicles.<span id="bookmark371">‌</span>

    <a href="#bookmark376" class="a">Figure 5.6</a> <span
    class="p">shows a demand curve with constant unit elasticity.
    Constant unitary elasticity, in either a supply or demand curve,
    occurs when a price change of one percent results in a quantity
    change of one percent. Figure 5.6 shows a demand curve with constant
    unit elasticity. Using the midpoint method, you can calculate that
    between points A and B on the demand curve, the price changes by
    28.6% and quantity demanded also changes by 28.6%. Hence, the
    elasticity equals 1. Between points B and C, price again changes by
    28.6% as does quantity, while between points C and D the
    corresponding percentage changes are 22.2% for both price and
    quantity. In each case, then, the percentage change in price equals
    the percentage change in quantity, and consequently elasticity
    equals 1. Notice that in absolute value, the declines in price, as
    you step down the demand curve, are not identical. Instead, the
    price falls by $2.00 from A to B, by a smaller amount of $1.50 from
    B to C, and by a still smaller amount of $0.90 from C to D. As a
    result, a demand curve with constant unitary elasticity moves from a
    steeper slope on the left and a flatter slope on the right—and a
    curved shape overall. Notice that in absolute value, the declines in
    price, as you step down the demand curve, are not identical.
    Instead, the price falls by $23 from A to B, by a smaller amount of
    $1.50 from B to C, and by a still smaller amount of $.90 from C
    to D. As a result, a demand curve with constant unitary elasticity
    has a steeper slope on the left and a flatter slope on the right—and
    a curved shape overall.</span>

    <span id="bookmark376">Figure 5.6 A Constant Unitary Elasticity
    Demand Curve</span> <span class="s37">A demand curve with constant
    unitary elasticity will be a curved line. Notice how price and
    quantity demanded change by an identical percentage amount between
    each pair of points on the demand curve.</span>

      

    Unlike the demand curve with unitary elasticity, the supply curve
    with unitary elasticity is represented by a straight

      

    line, and that line goes through the origin. In each pair of points
    on the supply curve there is an equal difference in quantity of 30.
    However, in percentage value, using the midpoint method, the steps
    are decreasing as one moves from left to right, from 28.6% to 22.2%
    to 18.2%, because the quantity points in each percentage calculation
    are getting increasingly larger, which expands the denominator in
    the elasticity calculation of the percentage change in quantity.

    <a href="#bookmark377" class="a">Figure</a> 5.7<span class="p">.
    From points D to E to F and to G on the supply curve, each step of
    $1.50 is the same in absolute value. However, if we measure the
    price changes in percentage change terms, using the midpoint method,
    they are also decreasing, from 28.6% to 22.2% to 18.2%, because the
    original price points in each percentage calculation are getting
    increasingly larger in value, increasing the denominator in the
    calculation of the percentage change in price. Along the constant
    unitary elasticity supply curve, the percentage quantity increases
    on the horizontal axis exactly match the percentage price increases
    on the vertical axis—so this supply curve has a constant unitary
    elasticity at all points.</span>

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Analyze how price elasticities impact revenue

    -   Evaluate how elasticity can cause shifts in demand and supply

    -   Predict how the long-run and short-run impacts of elasticity
        affect equilibrium

    -   Explain how the elasticity of demand and supply determine the
        incidence of a tax on buyers and sellers

      

    Studying elasticities is useful for a number of reasons, pricing
    being most important. Let’s explore how elasticity relates to
    revenue and pricing, both in the long and short run. First, let’s
    look at the elasticities of some common goods and services.

    a selection of demand elasticities for different goods and services
    drawn from a variety of different studies by economists, listed in
    order of increasing elasticity.</span>

    may have affected you.</span>

    Note that demand for necessities such as housing and electricity is
    inelastic, while items that are not necessities such as restaurant
    meals are more price-sensitive. If the price of a restaurant meal
    increases by 10%, the quantity demanded will decrease by 22.7%. A
    10% increase in the price of housing will cause only a slight
    decrease of 1.2% in the quantity of housing demanded.

    Does Raising Price Bring in More Revenue?

    Imagine that a band on tour is playing in an indoor arena with
    15,000 seats. To keep this example simple, assume that the band
    keeps all the money from ticket sales. Assume further that the band
    pays the costs for its appearance, but that these costs, like
    travel, and setting up the stage, are the same regardless of how
    many people are in the audience. Finally, assume that all the
    tickets have the same price. (The same insights apply if ticket
    prices are more expensive for some seats than for others, but the
    calculations become more complicated.) The band knows that it faces
    a downward-sloping demand curve; that is, if the band raises the
    ticket price and, it will sell fewer seats. How should the band set
    the ticket price to generate the most total revenue, which in this
    example, because costs are fixed, will also mean the highest profits
    for the band? Should the band sell more tickets at a lower price or
    fewer tickets at a higher price?

    <a href="#bookmark380" class="s34">The key concept in thinking about collecting the most revenue is the price elasticity of demand. Total revenue is price times the quantity of tickets sold. Imagine that the band starts off thinking about a certain price, which will result in the sale of a certain quantity of tickets. The three possibilities are in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark380" class="a">Table</a> 5.3<span class="p">. If
    demand is elastic at that price level, then the band should cut the
    price, because the percentage drop in price will result in an even
    larger percentage increase in the quantity sold—thus raising total
    revenue. However, if demand is inelastic at that original quantity
    level, then the band should raise the ticket price, because a
    certain percentage increase in price will result in a smaller
    percentage decrease in the quantity sold—and total revenue will
    rise. If demand has a unitary elasticity at that quantity, then an
    equal percentage change in quantity will offset a moderate
    percentage change in the price—so the band will earn the same
    revenue whether it (moderately) increases or decreases the ticket
    price.</span>

    Table 5.3 <span class="s47">Will the Band Earn More Revenue by
    Changing Ticket Prices?</span>

      

    What if the band keeps cutting price, because demand is elastic,
    until it reaches a level where it sells all 15,000 seats in the
    available arena? If demand remains elastic at that quantity, the
    band might try to move to a bigger arena, so that it could slash
    ticket prices further and see a larger percentage increase in the
    quantity of tickets sold. However, if the 15,000-seat arena is all
    that is available or if a larger arena would add substantially to
    costs, then this option may not work.

    Conversely, a few bands are so famous, or have such fanatical
    followings, that demand for tickets may be inelastic right up to the
    point where the arena is full. These bands can, if they wish, keep
    raising the ticket price. Ironically,

      

      

    some of the most popular bands could make more revenue by setting
    prices so high that the arena is not full—but those who buy the
    tickets would have to pay very high prices. However, bands sometimes
    choose to sell tickets for less than the absolute maximum they might
    be able to charge, often in the hope that fans will feel happier and
    spend more on recordings, T-shirts, and other paraphernalia.

    Can Businesses Pass Costs on to Consumers?

    <span id="bookmark381">Most businesses face a day-to-day struggle to
    figure out ways to produce at a lower cost, as one pathway to their
    goal of earning higher profits. However, in some cases, the price of
    a key input over which the firm has no control may rise. For
    example, many chemical companies use petroleum as a key input, but
    they have no control over the world market price for crude oil.
    Coffee shops use coffee as a key input, but they have no control
    over the world market price of coffee. If the cost of a key input
    rises, can the firm pass those higher costs along to consumers in
    the form of higher prices? Conversely, if new and less expensive
    ways of producing are invented, can the firm keep the benefits in
    the form of higher profits, or will the market pressure them to pass
    the gains along to consumers in the form of lower prices? The price
    elasticity of demand plays a key role in answering these
    questions.</span>

    </span>(b), the demand curve is highly elastic. In this case, the

    more, in general, when the demand curve is more inelastic because
    the shift in the supply results in a much lower price for consumers.

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_124.png" width="624" height="51" alt="image" />

    production leads to a severe drop in price that can actually
    decrease the total revenue that farmers receive. Conversely, poor
    weather or other conditions that cause a terrible year for farm
    production can sharply raise prices so that the total revenue that
    the farmer receives increases. The Clear It Up box discusses how
    these issues relate to coffee.

      

    How do coffee prices fluctuate?

    Coffee is an international crop. The top five coffee-exporting
    nations are Brazil, Vietnam, Colombia, Indonesia, and Ethiopia. In
    these nations and others, 20 million families depend on selling
    coffee beans as their main source of income. These families are
    exposed to enormous risk, because the world price of coffee bounces
    up and down. For example, in 1993, the world price of coffee was
    about 50 cents per pound. In 1995 it was four times as high, at $2
    per pound. By 1997 it had fallen by half to $1.00 per pound. In 1998
    it leaped back up to $2 per pound. By 2001 it had fallen back to 46
    cents a pound. By early 2011 it rose to about $2.31 per pound. By
    the end of 2012, the price had fallen back to about $1.31 per pound.

    <a href="#bookmark382" class="s84">The reason for these price fluctuations lies in a combination of inelastic demand and shifts in supply. The elasticity of coffee demand is only about 0.3; that is, a 10% rise in the price of coffee leads to a decline of about 3% in the quantity of coffee consumed. When a major frost hit the Brazilian coffee crop in 1994, coffee supply shifted to the left with an inelastic demand curve, leading to much higher prices. Conversely, when Vietnam entered the world coffee market as a major producer in the late 1990s, the supply curve shifted out to the right. With a highly inelastic demand curve, coffee prices fell dramatically.</a>
    Figure 5.8 <span class="s37">(a) illustrates this situation.</span>

      

    <a href="#bookmark383" class="s34">Elasticity also reveals whether firms can pass higher costs that they incur on to consumers. Addictive substances, for which demand is inelastic, are products for which producers can pass higher costs on to consumers. For example, the demand for cigarettes is relatively inelastic among regular smokers who are somewhat addicted. Economic research suggests that increasing cigarette prices by 10% leads to about a 3% reduction in the quantity of cigarettes that adults smoke, so the elasticity of demand for cigarettes is 0.3. If society increases taxes on companies that produce cigarettes, the result will be, as in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark383" class="a">Figure 5.9</a><span class="s54">
    </span>(a), that the supply curve shifts from S<span
    class="s60">0</span> to S<span class="s60">1</span>. However, as the
    equilibrium moves from E<span class="s60">0</span> to E<span
    class="s60">1</span>, governments mainly pass along these taxes to
    consumers in the form of higher prices. These higher taxes on
    cigarettes will raise tax revenue for the government, but they will
    not much affect the quantity of smoking.

    <a href="#bookmark383" class="s34">If the goal is to reduce the quantity of cigarettes demanded, we must achieve it by shifting this inelastic demand back to the left, perhaps with public programs to discourage cigarette use or to help people to quit. For example, anti-smoking advertising campaigns have shown some ability to reduce smoking. However, if cigarette demand were more elastic, as in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark383" class="a">Figure 5.9</a><span class="s54">
    </span>(b), then an increase in taxes that shifts supply from S<span
    class="s60">0</span> to S<span class="s60">1</span> and equilibrium
    from E<span class="s60">0</span> to E<span class="s60">1</span>
    would reduce the quantity of cigarettes smoked substantially. Youth
    smoking seems to be more elastic than adult smoking—that is, the
    quantity of youth smoking will fall by a greater percentage than the
    quantity of adult smoking in response to a given percentage increase
    in price.

    <span id="bookmark383">Figure 5.9 Passing along Higher Costs to
    Consumers</span> <span class="s37">Higher costs, like a higher tax
    on cigarette companies for the example we gave in the text, lead
    supply to shift to the left. This shift is identical in (a) and (b).
    However, in (a), where demand is inelastic, companies largely can
    pass the cost increase along to consumers in the form of higher
    prices, without much of a decline in equilibrium quantity. In (b),
    demand is elastic, so the shift in supply results primarily in a
    lower equilibrium quantity. Consumers suffer in either case, but in
    (a), they suffer from paying a higher price for the same quantity,
    while in (b), they suffer from buying a lower quantity (and
    presumably needing to shift their consumption elsewhere).</span>

      

    Elasticity and Tax Incidence

    <span id="bookmark384">The example of cigarette taxes demonstrated
    that because demand is inelastic, taxes are not effective at
    reducing the equilibrium quantity of smoking, and they mainly pass
    along to consumers in the form of higher prices. The analysis, or
    manner, of how a tax burden is divided between consumers and
    producers is called</span> **tax incidence**. Typically, the tax
    incidence, or burden, falls both on the consumers and producers of
    the taxed good. However, if one wants to predict which group will
    bear most of the burden, all one needs to do is examine the
    elasticity of demand and supply. In the tobacco example, the tax
    burden falls on the most inelastic side of the market.

    If demand is more inelastic than supply, consumers bear most of the
    tax burden, and if supply is more inelastic than demand, sellers
    bear most of the tax burden.

    The intuition for this is simple. When the demand is inelastic,
    consumers are not very responsive to price changes, and the quantity
    demanded reduces only modestly when the tax is introduced. In the
    case of smoking, the demand is inelastic because consumers are
    addicted to the product. The government can then pass the tax burden
    along to consumers in the form of higher prices, without much of a
    decline in the equilibrium quantity.

    <a href="#bookmark385" class="s34">Similarly, when a government introduces a tax in a market with an inelastic supply, such as, for example, beachfront hotels, and sellers have no alternative than to accept lower prices for their business, taxes do not greatly affect the equilibrium quantity. The tax burden now passes on to the sellers. If the supply was elastic and sellers had the possibility of reorganizing their businesses to avoid supplying the taxed good, the tax burden on the sellers would be much smaller. The tax would result in a much lower quantity sold instead of lower prices received.</a>
    <a href="#bookmark385" class="a">Figure</a> 5.10 <span
    class="p">illustrates this relationship between the tax incidence
    and elasticity of demand and supply.</span>

      

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_126.jpg" width="530" height="250" alt="image" />

    <span id="bookmark385">Figure 5.10 Elasticity and Tax
    Incidence</span> <span class="s37">An excise tax introduces a wedge
    between the price paid by consumers (Pc) and the price received by
    producers (Pp). The vertical distance between Pc and Pp is the
    amount of the tax per unit. Pe is the equilibrium price prior to
    introduction of the tax. (a) When the demand is more elastic than
    supply, the tax incidence on consumers Pc – Pe is lower than the tax
    incidence on producers Pe – Pp. (b) When the supply is more elastic
    than demand, the tax incidence on consumers Pc – Pe is larger than
    the tax incidence on producers Pe</span>

    – Pp. The more elastic the demand and supply curves, the lower the
    tax revenue.

      

    <a href="#bookmark385" class="s34">In</a>
    <a href="#bookmark385" class="a">Figure 5.10</a>
    <a href="#bookmark385" class="s34">(a), the supply is inelastic and the demand is elastic, such as in the example of beachfront hotels. While consumers may have other vacation choices, sellers can’t easily move their businesses. By introducing a tax, the government essentially creates a wedge between the price paid by consumers Pc and the price received by producers Pp. In other words, of the total price paid by consumers, part is retained by the sellers and part is paid to the government in the form of a tax. The distance between Pc and Pp is the tax rate. The new market price is Pc, but sellers receive only Pp per unit sold, as they pay Pc-Pp to the government. Since we can view a tax as raising the costs of production, this could also be represented by a leftward shift of the supply curve, where the new supply curve would intercept the demand at the new quantity Qt. For simplicity,</a>
    <a href="#bookmark385" class="a">Figure 5.10</a> <span
    class="p">omits the shift in the supply curve.</span>

    <a href="#bookmark385" class="s34">The tax revenue is given by the shaded area, which we obtain by multiplying the tax per unit by the total quantity sold Qt. The tax incidence on the consumers is given by the difference between the price paid Pc and the initial equilibrium price Pe. The tax incidence on the sellers is given by the difference between the initial equilibrium price Pe and the price they receive after the tax is introduced Pp. In</a>
    <a href="#bookmark385" class="a">Figure 5.10</a>
    <a href="#bookmark385" class="s34">(a), the tax burden falls disproportionately on the sellers, and a larger proportion of the tax revenue (the shaded area) is due to the resulting lower price received by the sellers than by the resulting higher prices paid by the buyers.</a>
    <a href="#bookmark385" class="a">Figure 5.10</a> <span class="p">(b)
    describes the example of the tobacco excise tax where the supply is
    more elastic than demand. The tax incidence now falls
    disproportionately on consumers, as shown by the large difference
    between the price they pay, Pc, and the initial equilibrium price,
    Pe. Sellers receive a lower price than before the tax, but this
    difference is much smaller than the change in consumers’ price. From
    this analysis one can also predict whether a tax is likely to create
    a large revenue or not. The more elastic the demand curve, the more
    likely that consumers will reduce quantity instead of paying higher
    prices. The more elastic the supply curve, the more likely that
    sellers will reduce the quantity sold, instead of taking lower
    prices. In a market where both the demand and supply are very
    elastic, the imposition of an excise tax generates low
    revenue.</span>

    Some believe that excise taxes hurt mainly the specific industries
    they target. For example, the medical device excise tax, in effect
    since 2013, has been controversial for it can delay industry
    profitability and therefore hamper start- ups and medical
    innovation. However, whether the tax burden falls mostly on the
    medical device industry or on the patients depends simply on the
    elasticity of demand and supply.

    Long-Run vs. Short-Run Impact

    Elasticities are often lower in the short run than in the long run.
    On the demand side of the market, it can sometimes be difficult to
    change Qd in the short run, but easier in the long run. Consumption
    of energy is a clear example. In the short run, it is not easy for a
    person to make substantial changes in energy consumption. Maybe you
    can carpool to work sometimes or adjust your home thermostat by a
    few degrees if the cost of energy rises, but that is about all.

      

      

    However, in the long run you can purchase a car that gets more miles
    to the gallon, choose a job that is closer to where you live, buy
    more energy-efficient home appliances, or install more insulation in
    your home. As a result, the elasticity of demand for energy is
    somewhat inelastic in the short run, but much more elastic in the
    long run.

    <a href="#bookmark386" class="a">Figure 5.11</a>
    <a href="#bookmark386" class="s34">is an example, based roughly on historical experience, for the responsiveness of Qd to price changes. In 1973, the price of crude oil was $12 per barrel and total consumption in the U.S. economy was 17 million barrels per day. That year, the nations who were members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) cut off oil exports to the United States for six months because the Arab members of OPEC disagreed with the U.S. support for Israel. OPEC did not bring exports back to their earlier levels until 1975—a policy that we can interpret as a shift of the supply curve to the left in the U.S. petroleum market.</a>

    demand curve D is different in (a) and (b), being more elastic
    in (b) than in (a). As a result, the shift in supply can result
    either in a new equilibrium with a much higher price and an only
    slightly smaller quantity, as in (a), with more inelastic demand, or
    in a new equilibrium with only a small increase in price and a
    relatively larger reduction in quantity, as in (b), with more

    <a href="#bookmark386" class="a">Figure 5.11</a>
    <a href="#bookmark386" class="s34">(a) shows inelastic demand for oil in the short run similar to that which existed for the United States in 1973. In</a>

    class="p">(a), the new equilibrium (E</span><span
    class="s60">1</span><a href="#bookmark386" class="s34">) occurs at a price of $25 per barrel, roughly double the price before the OPEC shock, and an equilibrium quantity of 16 million barrels per day.</a>
    <a href="#bookmark386" class="a">Figure</a> 5.11 <span class="p">(b)
    shows what the outcome would have been if the U.S. demand for oil
    had been more elastic, a result more likely over the long term. This
    alternative equilibrium (E</span><span class="s60">1</span><span
    class="p">) would have resulted in a smaller price increase to $14
    per barrel and larger reduction in equilibrium quantity to 13
    million barrels per day. In 1983, for example, U.S. petroleum
    consumption was 15.3 million barrels a day, which was lower than in
    1973 or 1975. U.S. petroleum consumption was down even though
    the</span>

    U.S. economy was about one-fourth larger in 1983 than it had been
    in 1973. The primary reason for the lower quantity was that higher
    energy prices spurred conservation efforts, and after a decade of
    home insulation, more fuel-efficient cars, more efficient appliances
    and machinery, and other fuel-conserving choices, the demand curve
    for energy had become more elastic.

    On the supply side of markets, producers of goods and services
    typically find it easier to expand production in the long term of
    several years rather than in the short run of a few months. After
    all, in the short run it can be costly or difficult to build a new
    factory, hire many new workers, or open new stores. However, over a
    few years, all of these are possible.

    In most markets for goods and services, prices bounce up and down
    more than quantities in the short run, but quantities often move
    more than prices in the long run. The underlying reason for this
    pattern is that supply and demand are often inelastic in the short
    run, so that shifts in either demand or supply can cause a
    relatively greater

      

      

    change in prices. However, since supply and demand are more elastic
    in the long run, the long-run movements in prices are more muted,
    while quantity adjusts more easily in the long run.

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Calculate the income elasticity of demand and the cross-price
        elasticity of demand

    -   Calculate the elasticity in labor and financial capital markets
        through an understanding of the elasticity of labor supply and
        the elasticity of savings

    -   Apply concepts of price elasticity to real-world situations

      

    The basic idea of elasticity—how a percentage change in one variable
    causes a percentage change in another variable—does not just apply
    to the responsiveness quantity supplied and quantity demanded to
    changes in the price of a product. Recall that quantity demanded
    (Qd) depends on income, tastes and preferences, the prices of
    related goods, and so on, as well as price. Similarly, quantity
    supplied (Qs) depends on factors such as the cost of production, as
    well as price. We can measure elasticity for any determinant of
    quantity supplied and quantity demanded, not just the price.

    Income Elasticity of Demand

    <span id="bookmark388">The income elasticity of demand is the
    percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage
    change in income.</span>

    % change in income

    Income elasticity of demand = <u>% change in quantity demanded</u>

    <span id="bookmark389">For most products, most of the time, the
    income elasticity of demand is positive: that is, a rise in income
    will cause an increase in the quantity demanded. This pattern is
    common enough that we refer to these goods as normal goods. However,
    for a few goods, an increase in income means that one might purchase
    less of the good. For example, those with a higher income might buy
    fewer hamburgers, because they are buying more steak instead, or
    those with a higher income might buy less cheap wine and more
    imported beer. When the income elasticity of demand is negative, we
    call the good an inferior good.</span><span
    id="bookmark390">‌</span>

    <a href="#bookmark159" class="s34">We introduced the concepts of normal and inferior goods in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark159" class="a">Demand and</a> Supply<span
    class="p">. A higher level of income causes a demand curve to shift
    to the right for a normal good, which means that the income
    elasticity of demand is positive. How far the demand shifts depends
    on the income elasticity of demand. A higher income elasticity means
    a larger shift. However, for an inferior good, that is, when the
    income elasticity of demand is negative, a higher level of income
    would cause the demand curve for that good to shift to the left.
    Again, how much it shifts depends on how large the (negative) income
    elasticity is.</span>

    Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand

    A change in the price of one good can shift the quantity demanded
    for another good. If the two goods are complements, like bread and
    peanut butter, then a drop in the price of one good will lead to an
    increase in the quantity demanded of the other good. However, if the
    two goods are substitutes, like plane tickets and train tickets,
    then a drop in the price of one good will cause people to substitute
    toward that good, and to reduce consumption of the other good.
    Cheaper plane tickets lead to fewer train tickets, and vice versa.

    <span id="bookmark391">The</span> **cross-price elasticity of
    demand** puts some meat on the bones of these ideas. The term
    “cross-price” refers to the idea that the price of one good is
    affecting the quantity demanded of a different good. Specifically,
    the cross-price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in the
    quantity of good A that is demanded as a result of a percentage
    change in the price of good B.

    % change in price of good B

    Cross-price elasticity of demand = <u>% change in Qd of good A  </u>

    Substitute goods have positive cross-price elasticities of demand:
    if good A is a substitute for good B, like coffee and tea, then a
    higher price for B will mean a greater quantity consumed of A.
    Complement goods have negative cross- price elasticities: if good A
    is a complement for good B, like coffee and sugar, then a higher
    price for B will mean a

      

      

    lower quantity consumed of A.

    Elasticity in Labor and Financial Capital Markets

    <span id="bookmark392">The concept of elasticity applies to any
    market, not just markets for goods and services. In the labor
    market, for example, the</span> **wage elasticity of labor
    supply**—that is, the percentage change in hours worked divided by
    the percentage change in wages—will reflect the shape of the labor
    supply curve. Specifically:

    % change in wage

    Elasticity of labor supply = <u>% change in quantity of labor
    supplied</u>

    The wage elasticity of labor supply for teenage workers is generally
    fairly elastic: that is, a certain percentage change in wages will
    lead to a larger percentage change in the quantity of hours worked.
    Conversely, the wage elasticity of labor supply for adult workers in
    their thirties and forties is fairly inelastic. When wages move up
    or down by a certain percentage amount, the quantity of hours that
    adults in their prime earning years are willing to supply changes
    but by a lesser percentage amount.

    <span id="bookmark393">In markets for financial capital, the</span>
    **elasticity of savings**—that is, the percentage change in the
    quantity of savings divided by the percentage change in interest
    rates—will describe the shape of the supply curve for financial
    capital. That is:

    Elasticity of savings =

    % change in quantity of financial savings

    % change in interest rate

    Sometimes laws are proposed that seek to increase the quantity of
    savings by offering tax breaks so that the return on savings is
    higher. Such a policy will have a comparatively large impact on
    increasing the quantity saved if the supply curve for financial
    capital is elastic, because then a given percentage increase in the
    return to savings will cause a higher percentage increase in the
    quantity of savings. However, if the supply curve for financial
    capital is highly inelastic, then a percentage increase in the
    return to savings will cause only a small increase in the quantity
    of savings. The evidence on the supply curve of financial capital is
    controversial but, at least in the short run, the elasticity of
    savings with respect to the interest rate appears fairly inelastic.

    Expanding the Concept of Elasticity

    The elasticity concept does not even need to relate to a typical
    supply or demand curve at all. For example, imagine that you are
    studying whether the Internal Revenue Service should spend more
    money on auditing tax returns. We can frame the question in terms of
    the elasticity of tax collections with respect to spending on tax
    enforcement; that is, what is the percentage change in tax
    collections derived from a given percentage change in spending on
    tax enforcement?

    <a href="#bookmark394" class="s34">With all of the elasticity concepts that we have just described, some of which are in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark394" class="a">Table</a> 5.4<span class="p">, the
    possibility of confusion arises. When you hear the phrases
    “elasticity of demand” or “elasticity of supply,” they refer to the
    elasticity with respect to price. Sometimes, either to be extremely
    clear or because economists are discussing a wide variety of
    elasticities, we will call the elasticity of demand or the demand
    elasticity the price elasticity of demand or the “elasticity of
    demand with respect to price.” Similarly, economists sometimes use
    the term elasticity of supply or the supply elasticity, to avoid any
    possibility of confusion, the price elasticity of supply or “the
    elasticity of supply with respect to price.” However, in whatever
    context, the idea of elasticity always refers to percentage change
    in one variable, almost always a price or money variable, and how it
    causes a percentage change in another variable, typically a quantity
    variable of some kind.</span>

    That Will Be How Much?

    How did the 60% price increase in 2011 end up for Netflix? It has
    been a very bumpy ride.

    Before the price increase, there were about 24.6 million U.S.
    subscribers. After the price increase, 810,000 infuriated U.S.
    consumers canceled their Netflix subscriptions, dropping the total
    number of subscribers to

    23.79 million. Fast forward to June 2013, when there were 36 million
    streaming Netflix subscribers in the United States. This was an
    increase of 11.4 million subscribers since the price increase—an
    average per quarter growth of about 1.6 million. This growth is less
    than the 2 million per quarter increases Netflix experienced in the
    fourth quarter of 2010 and the first quarter of 2011.

    During the first year after the price increase, the firm’s stock
    price (a measure of future expectations for the firm) fell from
    about $33.60 per share per share to just under $7.80. By the end of
    2016, however, the stock price was at $123 per share. Today, Netflix
    has more than 86 million subscribers million subscribers in fifty
    countries.

    What happened? Obviously, Netflix company officials understood the
    law of demand. Company officials reported, when announcing the price
    increase, this could result in the loss of about 600,000 existing
    subscribers. Using the elasticity of demand formula, it is easy to
    see company officials expected an inelastic response:

    =

    –600,000/\[(24 million + 24.6 million)/2\]

    $6/\[($10 + $16)/2\]

    =

    –600,000/24.3 million

    $6/$13

    =

    –0.025

    0.46

    = –0.05

    In addition, Netflix officials had anticipated the price increase
    would have little impact on attracting new customers. Netflix
    anticipated adding up to 1.29 million new subscribers in the third
    quarter of 2011. It is true this was slower growth than the firm had
    experienced—about 2 million per quarter.

    Why was the estimate of customers leaving so far off? In the more
    than two decades since Netflix had been founded, there was an
    increase in the number of close, but not perfect, substitutes.
    Consumers now had choices ranging from Vudu, Amazon Prime, Hulu, and
    Redbox, to retail stores. Jaime Weinman reported in *Maclean’s* that
    Redbox kiosks are “a five-minute drive for less from 68 percent of
    Americans, and it seems that many people still find a five-minute
    drive more convenient than loading up a movie online.” It seems that
    in 2012, many consumers still preferred a physical DVD disk over
    streaming video.

    What missteps did the Netflix management make? In addition to
    misjudging the elasticity of demand, by failing

      

    to account for close substitutes, it seems they may have also
    misjudged customers’ preferences and tastes. Yet, as the population
    increases, the preference for streaming video may overtake physical
    DVD disks. Netflix, the source of numerous late night talk show
    laughs and jabs in 2011, may yet have the last laugh.

    KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY

      

    1.  <a href="#bookmark353" class="a">Price Elasticity of Demand and Price Elasticity of</a>
        [Supply](#bookmark353)

        Price elasticity measures the responsiveness of the quantity
        demanded or supplied of a good to a change in its price. We
        compute it as the percentage change in quantity demanded (or
        supplied) divided by the percentage change in price. We can
        describe elasticity as elastic (or very responsive), unit
        elastic, or inelastic (not very responsive). Elastic demand or
        supply curves indicate that quantity demanded or supplied
        respond to price changes in a greater than proportional manner.
        An inelastic demand or supply curve is one where a given
        percentage change in price will cause a smaller percentage
        change in quantity demanded or supplied. A unitary elasticity
        means that a given percentage change in price leads to an equal
        percentage change in quantity demanded or supplied.

          

    2.  <a href="#bookmark369" class="a">Polar Cases of Elasticity and Constant</a>
        [Elasticity](#bookmark369)

        Infinite or perfect elasticity refers to the extreme case where
        either the quantity demanded or supplied changes by an infinite
        amount in response to any change in price at all. Zero
        elasticity refers to the extreme case in which a percentage
        change in price, no matter how large, results in zero change in
        quantity. Constant unitary elasticity in either a supply or
        demand curve refers to a situation where a price change of one
        percent results in a quantity change of one percent.

          

    3.  <a href="#bookmark378" class="a">Elasticity and</a>
        [Pricing](#bookmark378)

        In the market for goods and services, quantity supplied and
        quantity demanded are often relatively slow to react to changes
        in price in the short run, but react more substantially in the
        long run. As a result, demand and supply often (but not always)
        tend to be relatively inelastic in the short run and relatively
        elastic in the long run. A tax incidence depends on the relative
        price elasticity of supply and demand. When supply is more
        elastic than demand, buyers bear most of the tax burden, and
        when demand is more elastic than supply, producers bear most of
        the cost of the tax. Tax revenue is larger the more inelastic
        the demand and supply are.

          

    4.  <a href="#bookmark387" class="a">Elasticity in Areas Other Than</a>
        [Price](#bookmark387)

Elasticity is a general term, that reflects responsiveness. It refers to
the change of one variable divided by the percentage change of a related
variable that we can apply to many economic connections. For instance,
the income elasticity of demand is the percentage change in quantity
demanded divided by the percentage change in income. The cross-price
elasticity of demand is the percentage change in the quantity demanded
of a good divided by the percentage change in the price of another good.
Elasticity applies in labor markets and financial capital markets just
as it does in markets for goods and services. The wage elasticity of
labor supply is the percentage change in the quantity of hours supplied
divided by the percentage change in the wage. The elasticity of savings
with respect to interest rates is the percentage change in the quantity
of savings divided by the percentage change in interest rates.

    that could increase Qs almost without limit in response to an
    increase in the price?

2.  Would you expect supply to play a more significant role in
    determining the price of a basic necessity like food or a luxury

    of demand will differ between necessities and luxuries.

      

3.  A city has built a bridge over a river and it decides to charge a
    toll to everyone who crosses. For one year, the city charges a
    variety of different tolls and records information on how many
    drivers cross the bridge. The city thus gathers information about
    elasticity of demand. If the city wishes to raise as much revenue as
    possible from the tolls, where will the city decide to charge a
    toll: in the inelastic portion of the demand curve, the elastic
    portion of the demand curve, or the unit elastic portion? Explain.

4.  In a market where the supply curve is perfectly inelastic, how does
    an excise tax affect the price paid by consumers and the quantity
    bought and sold?

5.  Economists define normal goods as having a positive income
    elasticity. We can divide normal goods into two types: Those whose
    income elasticity is less than one and those whose income elasticity
    is greater than one. Think about products that would fall into each
    category. Can you come up with a name for each category?

    supply as price rises from 3 to 4? What is the elasticity of supply
    as the price rises from 7 to 8? Would you expect these answers to be
    the same?

    elasticity in moving from a price of 4 to a price of 7?

11. The supply of paintings by Leonardo Da Vinci, who painted the *Mona
    Lisa* and *The Last Supper* and died in 1519, is highly inelastic.
    Sketch a supply and demand diagram, paying attention to the
    appropriate elasticities, to illustrate that demand for these
    paintings will determine the price.

    treatment with a dialysis machine (unless or until they receive a
    kidney transplant) or they will die. Sketch a supply and demand
    diagram, paying attention to the appropriate elasticities, to
    illustrate that the supply of such dialysis machines will primarily
    determine the price.

14. Assume that the supply of low-skilled workers is fairly elastic, but
    the employers’ demand for such workers is fairly inelastic. If the
    policy goal is to expand employment for low-skilled workers, is it
    better to focus on policy tools to shift the supply of unskilled
    labor or on tools to shift the demand for unskilled labor? What if
    the policy goal is to raise wages for this group? Explain your
    answers with supply and demand diagrams.

How is the Economy Doing? How Does One Tell?

The 1990s were boom years for the U.S. economy. Beginning in the late
2000s, from 2007 to 2014 economic performance in in the U.S. was poor.
What causes the economy to expand or contract? Why do businesses fail
when they are making all the right decisions? Why do workers lose their
jobs when they are hardworking and productive? Are bad economic times a
failure of the market system? Are they a failure of the government?
These are all questions of macroeconomics, which we will begin to
address in this chapter. We will not be able to answer all of these
questions here, but we will start with the basics: How is the economy
doing? How can we tell?

The macro economy includes all buying and selling, all production and
consumption; everything that goes on in every market in the economy. How
can we get a handle on that? The answer begins more than 80 years ago,
during the Great Depression. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his
economic advisers knew things were bad—but how could they express and
measure just how bad it was? An economist named Simon Kuznets, who later
won the Nobel Prize for his work, came up with a way to track what the
entire economy is producing. In this chapter, you will learn how the
government constructs GDP, how we use it, and why it is so important.

#### Introduction to the Macroeconomic Perspective

In this chapter, you will learn about:

-   Measuring the Size of the Economy: Gross Domestic Product

-   Adjusting Nominal Values to Real Values

-   Tracking Real GDP over Time

-   Comparing GDP among Countries

-   How Well GDP Measures the Well-Being of Society

  

Macroeconomics focuses on the economy as a whole (or on whole economies
as they interact). What causes recessions? What makes unemployment stay
high when recessions are supposed to be over? Why do some countries grow
faster than others? Why do some countries have higher standards of
living than others? These are all questions that macroeconomics
addresses. Macroeconomics involves adding up the economic activity of
all households and all businesses in all markets to obtain the overall
demand and supply in the economy. However, when we do that, something
curious happens. It is not unusual that what results at the macro level
is different from the sum of the microeconomic parts. What seems
sensible from a microeconomic point of view can have unexpected or
counterproductive results at the macroeconomic level. Imagine that you
are sitting at an event with a large audience, like a live concert or a
basketball game. A few people decide that they want a better view, and
so they stand up. However, when these people stand up, they block the
view for other people, and the others need to stand up as well if they
wish to see. Eventually, nearly everyone is standing up, and as a
result, no one can see much better than before. The rational decision of
some individuals at the micro level—to stand up for a better view—ended
up as self-defeating at the macro level. This is not macroeconomics, but
it is an apt analogy.

<a href="#bookmark433" class="s34">Macroeconomics is a rather massive subject. How are we going to tackle it?</a>
<a href="#bookmark433" class="a">Figure 6.2</a> <span
class="p">illustrates the structure we will use. We will study
macroeconomics from three different perspectives:</span>

1.  What are the macroeconomic goals? (Macroeconomics as a discipline
    does not have goals, but we do have goals for the macro economy.)

2.  What are the frameworks economists can use to analyze the
    macroeconomy?

3.  Finally, what are the policy tools governments can use to manage the
    macroeconomy?

<span id="bookmark433">Figure 6.2 Macroeconomic Goals, Framework, and
Policies</span> <span class="s37">This chart shows what macroeconomics
is about. The box on the left indicates a consensus of what are the most
important goals for the macro economy, the middle box lists the
frameworks economists use to analyze macroeconomic changes (such as
inflation or recession), and the box on the right indicates the two
tools the federal government uses to influence the macro economy.</span>

  

Goals

In thinking about the macroeconomy's overall health, it is useful to
consider three primary goals: economic growth, low unemployment, and low
inflation.

-   Economic growth ultimately determines the prevailing standard of
    living in a country. Economists measure growth by the percentage
    change in real (inflation-adjusted) gross domestic product. A growth
    rate of more than 3% is considered good.

-   Unemployment, as measured by the unemployment rate, is the
    percentage of people in the labor force who do not have a job. When
    people lack jobs, the economy is wasting a precious resource-labor,
    and the result is

      

      

    lower goods and services produced. Unemployment, however, is more
    than a statistic—it represents people’s livelihoods. While measured
    unemployment is unlikely to ever be zero, economists consider a
    measured unemployment rate of 5% or less low (good).

-   Inflation is a sustained increase in the overall level of prices,
    and is measured by the consumer price index. If many people face a
    situation where the prices that they pay for food, shelter, and
    healthcare are rising much faster than the wages they receive for
    their labor, there will be widespread unhappiness as their standard
    of living declines. For that reason, low inflation—an inflation rate
    of 1–2%—is a major goal.

Frameworks

<a href="#bookmark14" id="bookmark434" class="s34">As you learn in the micro part of this book, principal tools that economists use are theories and models (see</a>
<a href="#bookmark14" class="a">Welcome to Economics!</a> <span
class="p">for more on this). In microeconomics, we used the theories of
supply and demand. In macroeconomics, we use the theories of aggregate
demand (AD) and aggregate supply (AS). This book presents two
perspectives on macroeconomics: the Neoclassical perspective and the
Keynesian perspective, each of which has its own version of AD and AS.
Between the two perspectives, you will obtain a good understanding of
what drives the macroeconomy.</span>

Policy Tools

National governments have two tools for influencing the macroeconomy.
The first is monetary policy, which involves managing the money supply
and interest rates. The second is fiscal policy, which involves changes
in government spending/purchases and taxes.

<a href="#bookmark433" class="s34">We will explain each of the items in</a>
<a href="#bookmark433" class="a">Figure 6.2</a> <span class="p">in
detail in one or more other chapters. As you learn these things, you
will discover that the goals and the policy tools are in the news almost
every day.</span>

1.  <span id="bookmark425">|</span> <span
    style=" color: #3767B1;">Measuring the Size of the Economy: Gross
    Domestic Product</span><span id="bookmark435">‌</span>

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Identify the components of GDP on the demand side and on the
        supply side

    -   Evaluate how economists measure gross domestic product (GDP)

    -   Contrast and calculate GDP, net exports, and net national
        product

      

    Macroeconomics is an empirical subject, so the first step toward
    understanding it is to measure the economy.

    <span id="bookmark436">How large is the U.S. economy? Economists
    typically measure the size of a nation’s overall economy by
    its</span> **gross domestic product (GDP)**, which is the value of
    all final goods and services produced within a country in a given
    year. Measuring GDP involves counting the production of millions of
    different goods and services—smart phones, cars, music downloads,
    computers, steel, bananas, college educations, and all other new
    goods and services that a country produced in the current year—and
    summing them into a total dollar value. This task is
    straightforward: take the quantity of everything produced, multiply
    it by the price at which each product sold, and add up the total. In
    2016, the U.S. GDP totaled $18.6 trillion, the largest GDP in the
    world.

    Each of the market transactions that enter into GDP must involve
    both a buyer and a seller. We can measure an economy's GDP either by
    the total dollar value of what consumers purchase in the economy, or
    by the total dollar value of what is the country produces. There is
    even a third way, as we will explain later.

    GDP Measured by Components of Demand

    What does the word “investment” mean?

    What do economists mean by investment, or business spending? In
    calculating GDP, investment does not refer to purchasing stocks and
    bonds or trading financial assets. It refers to purchasing new
    capital goods, that is, new commercial real estate (such as
    buildings, factories, and stores) and equipment, residential housing
    construction, and inventories. Inventories that manufacturers
    produce this year are included in this year’s GDP—even if they are
    not yet sold. From the accountant’s perspective, it is as if the
    firm invested in its own inventories. Business investment in 2016
    was $3 trillion, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.

    <a href="http://bea.gov/iTable/index_nipa.cfm)" class="s84">(a) Consumption is about two-thirds of GDP, and it has been on a slight upward trend over time. Business investment hovers around 15% of GDP, but it fluctuates more than consumption. Government spending on goods and services is slightly under 20% of GDP and has declined modestly over time. (b) Exports are added to total demand for goods and services, while imports are subtracted from total demand. If exports exceed imports, as in most of the 1960s and 1970s in the U.S. economy, a trade surplus exists. If imports exceed exports, as in recent years, then a trade deficit exists. (Source: http://bea.gov/iTable/index_nipa.cfm)</a>

      

    Consumption expenditure by households is the largest component of
    GDP, accounting for about two-thirds of the GDP in any year. This
    tells us that consumers’ spending decisions are a major driver of
    the economy. However, consumer spending is a gentle elephant: when
    viewed over time, it does not jump around too much, and has
    increased modestly from about 60% of GDP in the 1960s and 1970s.

    <span id="bookmark440">Investment expenditure refers to purchases of
    physical plant and equipment, primarily by businesses. If Starbucks
    builds a new store, or Amazon buys robots, they count these
    expenditures under business investment. Investment demand is far
    smaller than consumption demand, typically accounting for only about
    15–18% of GDP, but it is very important for the economy because this
    is where jobs are created. However, it fluctuates more noticeably
    than consumption. Business investment is volatile. New technology or
    a new product can spur business investment, but then confidence can
    drop and business investment can pull back sharply.</span><span

    <span id="bookmark443">How do statisticians measure GDP?</span>

    Government economists at the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA),
    within the U.S. Department of Commerce, piece together estimates of
    GDP from a variety of sources.

    Once every five years, in the second and seventh year of each
    decade, the Bureau of the Census carries

    If you have noticed any of the infrastructure projects (new bridges,
    highways, airports) launched during the 2009 recession, you have
    seen how important government spending can be for the economy.
    Government expenditure in the United States is close to 20% of GDP,
    and includes spending by all three levels of government: federal,
    state, and local. The only part of government spending counted in
    demand is government purchases of goods or services produced in the
    economy. Examples include the government buying a new fighter jet
    for the Air Force (federal government spending), building a new
    highway (state government spending), or a new school (local
    government spending). A significant portion of government budgets
    consists of transfer payments, like unemployment benefits, veteran’s
    benefits, and Social Security payments to retirees. The government
    excludes these payments from GDP because it does not receive a new
    good or service in return or exchange. Instead they are transfers of
    income from taxpayers to others. If you are curious about the
    awesome undertaking of adding up GDP, read the following Clear It Up
    feature.

      

      

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_144.png" width="624" height="495" alt="image" />

    out a detailed census of businesses throughout the United States. In
    between, the Census Bureau carries out a monthly survey of retail
    sales. The government adjusts these figures with foreign trade data
    to account for exports that are produced in the United States and
    sold abroad and for imports that are produced abroad and sold here.
    Once every ten years, the Census Bureau conducts a comprehensive
    survey of housing and residential finance. Together, these sources
    provide the main basis for figuring out what is produced for
    consumers.

    For investment, the Census Bureau carries out a monthly survey of
    construction and an annual survey of expenditures on physical
    capital equipment.

    For what the federal government purchases, the statisticians rely on
    the U.S. Department of the Treasury. An annual Census of Governments
    gathers information on state and local governments. Because the
    government spends a considerable amount at all levels hiring people
    to provide services, it also tracks a large portion of spending
    through payroll records that state governments and the Social
    Security Administration collect.

    With regard to foreign trade, the Census Bureau compiles a monthly
    record of all import and export documents. Additional surveys cover
    transportation and travel, and make adjustments for financial
    services that are produced in the United States for foreign
    customers.

    Many other sources contribute to GDP estimates. Information on
    energy comes from the U.S. Department of Transportation and
    Department of Energy. The Agency for Health Care Research and
    Quality collects information on healthcare. Surveys of landlords
    find out about rental income. The Department of Agriculture collects
    statistics on farming.

    All these bits and pieces of information arrive in different forms,
    at different time intervals. The BEA melds them together to produce
    GDP estimates on a quarterly basis (every three months). The BEA
    then "annualizes" these numbers by multiplying by four. As more
    information comes in, the BEA updates and revises these estimates.
    BEA releases the GDP “advance” estimate for a certain quarter one
    month after a quarter. The “preliminary” estimate comes out one
    month after that. The BEA publishes the “final” estimate one month
    later, but it is not actually final. In July, the BEA releases
    roughly updated estimates for the previous calendar year. Then, once
    every five years, after it has processed all the results of the
    latest detailed five-year business census, the BEA revises all of
    the past GDP estimates according to the newest methods and data,
    going all the way back to 1929.

    <span id="bookmark444">When thinking about the demand for
    domestically produced goods in a global economy, it is important to
    count spending on exports—domestically produced goods that a country
    sells abroad. Similarly, we must also subtract spending on
    imports—goods that a country produces in other countries that
    residents of this country purchase. The GDP net export component is
    equal to the dollar value of exports (X) minus the dollar value of
    imports (M), (X – M). We call the gap between exports and imports
    the</span> **trade balance**. If a country’s exports are larger than
    its imports, then a country has a **trade
    surplus**<a href="#bookmark439" class="s34">. In the United States, exports typically exceeded imports in the 1960s and 1970s, as</a>
    <a href="#bookmark439" class="a">Figure</a> <span

    <span id="bookmark446">Since the early 1980s, imports have typically
    exceeded exports, and so the United States has experienced a</span>

    <span id="bookmark447">deficit</span>
    <a href="#bookmark439" class="s34">in most years. The trade deficit grew quite large in the late 1990s and in the mid-2000s.</a>
    <a href="#bookmark439" class="a">Figure</a> <span class="s54">6.4
    </span><span class="p">(b) also shows that imports and exports have
    both risen substantially in recent decades, even after the declines
    during the Great Recession between 2008 and 2009. As we noted
    before, if exports and imports are equal, foreign trade has no
    effect on total GDP. However, even if exports and imports are
    balanced overall, foreign trade might still have powerful effects on
    particular industries and workers by causing nations to shift
    workers and physical capital investment toward one industry rather
    than another.</span>

    Based on these four components of demand, we can measure GDP as:

    GDP = Consumption + Investment + Government + Trade balance GDP =
    C + I + G + (X – M)

    Understanding how to measure GDP is important for analyzing
    connections in the macro economy and for thinking about
    macroeconomic policy tools.

    GDP Measured by What is Produced

    <a href="#bookmark449" class="a">Table 6.2</a><span class="s54">

    <span id="bookmark451">Figure 6.6 Types of Production</span> <span
    class="s37">Services are the largest single component of total
    supply, representing over 60 percent of GDP, up from about 45 perent
    in the early 1960s. Durable and nondurable goods constitute the
    manufacturing sector, and they have declined from 45 percent of GDP
    in 1960 to about 30 percent in 2016.</span>

    Nondurable goods used to be larger than durable goods, but in recent
    years, nondurable goods have been dropping to below the share of
    durable goods, which is less than 20% of GDP. Structures hover
    around 10% of GDP. We do not show here the change in inventories,
    the final component of aggregate supply. It is typically less than
    1% of GDP.

      

    In thinking about what is produced in the economy, many
    non-economists immediately focus on solid, long-lasting goods, like
    cars and computers. By far the largest part of GDP, however, is
    services. Moreover, services have been a growing share of GDP over
    time. A detailed breakdown of the leading service industries would
    include healthcare, education, and legal and financial services. It
    has been decades since most of the U.S. economy involved making
    solid objects. Instead, the most common jobs in a modern economy
    involve a worker looking at pieces of paper or a computer screen;
    meeting with co-workers, customers, or suppliers; or making phone
    calls.

    Even within the overall category of goods, long-lasting durable
    goods like cars and refrigerators are about the same share of the
    economy as short-lived nondurable goods like food and clothing. The
    category of structures includes everything from homes, to office
    buildings, shopping malls, and factories. Inventories is a small
    category that refers to the goods that one business has produced but
    has not yet sold to consumers, and are still sitting in warehouses
    and on shelves. The amount of inventories sitting on shelves tends
    to decline if business is better than expected, or to rise if
    business is worse than expected.

    Another Way to Measure GDP: The National Income Approach

    <span id="bookmark452">GDP is a measure of what is produced in a
    nation. The primary way GDP is estimated is with the Expenditure
    Approach we discussed above, but there is another way. Everything a
    firm produces, when sold, becomes revenues to the firm. Businesses
    use revenues to pay their bills: Wages and salaries for labor,
    interest and dividends for capital, rent for land, profit to the
    entrepreneur, etc. So adding up all the income produced in a year
    provides a second way of measuring GDP. This is why the terms GDP
    and</span> **national income** are sometimes used interchangeably.
    The total

      

      

    value of a nation’s output is equal to the total value of a nation’s
    income.

    The Problem of Double Counting

    <span id="bookmark453">We define GDP as the current value of all
    final goods and services produced in a nation in a year. What are
    final goods? They are goods at the furthest stage of production at
    the end of a year. Statisticians who calculate GDP must avoid the
    mistake of</span> **double counting**, in which they count output
    more than once as it travels through the production stages. For
    example, imagine what would happen if government statisticians first
    counted the value of tires that a tire manufacturer produces, and
    then counted the value of a new truck that an automaker sold that
    contains those tires. In this example, the statisticians would have
    counted the value of the tires twice-because the truck's price
    includes the value of the tires.

    <span id="bookmark454">To avoid this problem, which would overstate
    the size of the economy considerably, government statisticians count
    just the value of</span> **final goods and services** in the chain
    of production that are sold for consumption, investment, government,
    and trade purposes. Statisticians exclude intermediate
    **intermediate goods**, which are goods that go into producing other
    goods, from GDP calculations. From the example above, they will only
    count the Ford truck's value. The value of what businesses provide
    to other businesses is captured in the final products at the end of
    the production chain.<span id="bookmark455">‌</span>

    The concept of GDP is fairly straightforward: it is just the dollar
    value of all final goods and services produced in the economy in a
    year. In our decentralized, market-oriented economy, actually
    calculating the more than $18 trillion- dollar U.S. GDP—along with
    how it is changing every few months—is a full-time job for a brigade
    of government statisticians.

    they were produced in a previous year and are part of that year’s
    GDP. The entire underground economy of services paid “under the
    table” and illegal sales should be counted, but is not, because it
    is impossible to track these sales. In Friedrich Schneider's recent
    study of shadow economies, he estimated the underground economy in
    the United States to be 6.6% of GDP, or close to $2 trillion dollars
    in 2013 alone. Transfer payments, such as payment by the government
    to individuals, are not included, because they do not represent
    production. Also, production of some goods—such as home production
    as when you make your breakfast—is not counted because these goods
    are not sold in the marketplace.</span>

    Other Ways to Measure the Economy

    Besides GDP, there are several different but closely related ways of
    measuring the size of the economy. We mentioned above that we can
    think of GDP as total production and as total purchases. We can also
    think of it as total income since anything one produces and sells
    yields income.

    <span id="bookmark457">One of the closest cousins of GDP is
    the</span> **gross national product (GNP)**. GDP includes only what
    country produces within its borders. GNP adds what domestic
    businesses and labor abroad produces, and subtracts any payments
    that foreign labor and businesses located in the United States send
    home to other countries. In other words, GNP is based more on what a
    country's citizens and firms produce, wherever they are located, and
    GDP is based on what happens within a certain county's geographic
    boundaries. For the United States, the gap between GDP and GNP is
    relatively small; in recent years, only about 0.2%. For small
    nations, which may have a substantial share of their population
    working abroad and sending money back home, the difference can be
    substantial.

    <span id="bookmark458">We calculate</span> **net national product
    (NNP)** by taking GNP and then subtracting the value of how much
    physical capital is worn out, or reduced in value because of aging,
    over the course of a year. The process by which capital ages and
    loses value is called **depreciation**. We can further subdivide NNP
    into **national income**, which includes all income to businesses
    and individuals, and personal income, which includes only income to
    people.<span id="bookmark459">‌</span>

    Calculating GDP, Net Exports, and NNP

    <a href="#bookmark460" class="s84">Based on the information in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark460" class="s43">Table</a> 6.4<span
    class="s37">:</span>

    1.  What is the value of GDP?

    2.  What is the value of net exports?

    3.  What is the value of NNP?

    Table 6.4

    For practical purposes, it is not vital to memorize these
    definitions. However, it is important to be aware that these
    differences exist and to know what statistic you are examining, so
    that you do not accidentally compare, say, GDP in one year or for
    one country with GNP or NNP in another year or another country. To
    get an idea of how these calculations work, follow the steps in the
    following Work It Out feature.

    Table 6.4

    Step 1. To calculate GDP use the following formula:

    GDP = Consumption + Investment + Government spending + (Exports –
    Imports)

    = C + I + G + (X – M)

    = $400 + $60 + $120 + ($100 – $120)

    = $560 billion

    Step 2. To calculate net exports, subtract imports from exports.

    Net exports = X – M

    = $100 – $120

    = –$20 billion

    Step 3. To calculate NNP, use the following formula:

    NNP = GDP + Income receipts from the rest of the world

    – Income payments to the rest of the world – Depreciation

    = $560 + $10 – $8 – $40

    = $522 billion

    <span id="bookmark462">When examining economic statistics, there is
    a crucial distinction worth emphasizing. The distinction is between
    nominal and real measurements, which refer to whether or not
    inflation has distorted a given statistic. Looking at economic
    statistics without considering inflation is like looking through a
    pair of binoculars and trying to guess how close something is:
    unless you know how strong the lenses are, you cannot guess the
    distance very accurately. Similarly, if you do not know the
    inflation rate, it is difficult to figure out if a rise in GDP is
    due mainly to a rise in the overall level of prices or to a rise in
    quantities of goods produced. The</span> **nominal value** of any
    economic statistic means that we measure the statistic in terms of
    actual prices that exist at the time. The **real value** refers to
    the same statistic after it has been adjusted for inflation.
    Generally, it is the real value that is more important.<span

    If an unwary analyst compared nominal GDP in 1960 to nominal GDP in
    2010, it might appear that national output had risen by a factor of
    more than twenty-seven over this time (that is, GDP of $14,958
    billion in 2010 divided by GDP of $543 billion in 1960 = 27.5). This
    conclusion would be highly misleading. Recall that we define nominal
    GDP as the quantity of every good or service produced multiplied by
    the price at which it was sold, summed up for all goods and
    services. In order to see how much production has actually
    increased, we need to extract the effects of higher prices on
    nominal GDP. We can easily accomplish this using the GDP deflator.

    <a href="#bookmark690" id="bookmark466" class="s34">The GDP deflator is a price index measuring the average prices of all goods and services included in the economy. We explore price indices in detail and how we compute them in</a>
    Inflation<a href="#bookmark464" class="s34">, but this definition will do in the context of this chapter.</a>

    <span id="bookmark467">Figure 6.8 U.S. GDP Deflator,
    1960–2010</span> <span class="s37">Much like nominal GDP, the GDP
    deflator has risen exponentially from 1960 through 2010. (Source:
    BEA)</span>

      

    <a href="#bookmark467" class="a">Figure 6.8</a> <span
    class="p">shows that the price level has risen dramatically
    since 1960. The price level in 2010 was almost six times higher than
    in 1960 (the deflator for 2010 was 110 versus a level of 19 in
    1960). Clearly, much of the growth in nominal GDP was due to
    inflation, not an actual change in the quantity of goods and
    services produced, in other words, not in real GDP. Recall that
    nominal GDP can rise for two reasons: an increase in output, and/or
    an increase in prices. What is needed is to extract the increase in
    prices from nominal GDP so as to measure only changes in output.
    After all, the dollars used to measure nominal GDP in 1960 are worth
    more than the inflated dollars of 1990—and the price index tells
    exactly how much more. This adjustment is easy to do if you
    understand that nominal measurements are in value terms,
    where</span>

    Value = Price × Quantity

    or

    Nominal GDP = GDP Deflator × Real GDP

    Let’s look at an example at the micro level. Suppose the t-shirt
    company, Coolshirts, sells 10 t-shirts at a price of $9 each.

      

    Then,

    Coolshirt's nominal revenue from sales = Price × Quantity

    = $9 × 10

    = $90

      

    Price

    Coolshirt's real income = <u>Nominal revenue</u>

    =

    $90

    $9

    = 10

    In other words, when we compute “real” measurements we are trying to
    obtain actual quantities, in this case, 10 t- shirts.

    With GDP, it is just a tiny bit more complicated. We start with the
    same formula as above:

    Real GDP =

    Nominal GDP<span class="s16"> Price Index</span>

    For reasons that we will explain in more detail below,
    mathematically, a price index is a two-digit decimal number like

    1.00 or 0.85 or 1.25. Because some people have trouble working with
    decimals, when the price index is published, it has traditionally
    been multiplied by 100 to get integer numbers like 100, 85, or 125.
    What this means is that when we “deflate” nominal figures to get
    real figures (by dividing the nominal by the price index). We also
    need to remember to divide the published price index by 100 to make
    the math work. Thus, the formula becomes:

      

      

    Real GDP =

      Nominal GDP<span class="s16"> Price Index / 100</span>

    Now read the following Work It Out feature for more practice
    calculating real GDP.

      

    Computing GDP

    <a href="#bookmark464" class="s84">It is possible to use the data in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark464" class="s43">Table</a> 6.5 <span
    class="s37">to compute real GDP.</span>

    <a href="#bookmark464" class="s84">Step 1. Look at</a>
    <a href="#bookmark464" class="s43">Table</a> 6.5<span class="s37">,
    to see that, in 1960, nominal GDP was $543.3 billion and the price
    index (GDP deflator) was 19.0.</span>

    Step 2. To calculate the real GDP in 1960, use the formula:

    Real GDP =

      Nominal GDP<span class="s16"> Price Index / 100</span>

    =

    $543.3 billion<span class="s16"> 19 / 100</span>

    = $2,859.5 billion

    We’ll do this in two parts to make it clear. First adjust the price
    index: 19 divided by 100 = 0.19. Then divide into nominal GDP:
    $543.3 billion / 0.19 = $2,859.5 billion.

    Step 3. Use the same formula to calculate the real GDP in 1965.

    Real GDP =

      Nominal GDP<span class="s16"> Price Index / 100</span>

    =

    $743.7 billion<span class="s16"> 20.3 / 100</span>

    = $3,663.5 billion

    <a href="#bookmark468" class="s84">Step 4. Continue using this formula to calculate all of the real GDP values from 1960 through 2010. The calculations and the results are in</a>

    There are a couple things to notice here. Whenever you compute a
    real statistic, one year (or period) plays a special role. It is
    called the base year (or base period). The base year is the year
    whose prices we use to compute the real statistic. When we calculate
    real GDP, for example, we take the quantities of goods and services
    produced in each year (for example, 1960 or 1973) and multiply them
    by their prices in the base year (in this case, 2005), so we get a
    measure of GDP that uses prices that do not change from year to
    year. That is why real GDP is labeled “Constant Dollars” or, in this
    example, “2005 Dollars,” which means that real GDP is constructed
    using prices that existed in 2005. While the example here uses 2005
    as the base year, more generally, you can use any year as the base
    year. The formula is:

    Real GDP

    GDP deflator = <u>Nominal GDP</u><span class="s86"> </span>× 100

      

    Rearranging the formula and using the data from 2005:

    Real GDP =

      Nominal GDP<span class="s16"> Price Index / 100</span>

    =

    $13,095.4 billion<span class="s16"> 100 / 100</span>

    = $13,095.4 billion

    Comparing real GDP and nominal GDP for 2005, you see they are the
    same. This is no accident. It is because we have chosen 2005 as the
    “base year” in this example. Since the price index in the base year
    always has a value of 100 (by definition), nominal and real GDP are
    always the same in the base year.

    Look at the data for 2010.

    Real GDP =

      Nominal GDP<span class="s16"> Price Index / 100</span>

    =

    $14,958.3 billion<span class="s16"> 110 / 100</span>

    = $13,598.5 billion

    Use this data to make another observation: As long as inflation is
    positive, meaning prices increase on average from year to year, real
    GDP should be less than nominal GDP in any year after the base year.
    The reason for this should be clear: The value of nominal GDP is
    “inflated” by inflation. Similarly, as long as inflation is
    positive, real GDP should be greater than nominal GDP in any year
    before the base year.

      

    <a href="#bookmark471" id="bookmark469" class="a">Figure 6.9</a>
    <span class="p">shows the U.S. nominal and real GDP since 1960.
    Because 2005 is the base year, the nominal and real values are
    exactly the same in that year. However, over time, the rise in
    nominal GDP looks much larger than the rise in real GDP (that is,
    the nominal GDP line rises more steeply than the real GDP line),
    because the presence of</span><span id="bookmark470">‌</span>

      

      

    inflation, especially in the 1970s exaggerates the rise in nominal
    GDP.

    <span id="bookmark471">Figure 6.9 U.S. Nominal and Real GDP,
    1960–2012</span> <span class="s37">The red line measures U.S. GDP in
    nominal dollars. The black line measures U.S. GDP in real dollars,
    where all dollar values are converted to 2005 dollars. Since we
    express real GDP in 2005 dollars, the two lines cross in 2005.
    However, real GDP will appear higher than nominal GDP in the years
    before 2005, because dollars were worth less in 2005 than in
    previous years. Conversely, real GDP will appear lower in the years
    after 2005, because dollars were worth more in 2005 than in later
    years.</span>

      

    Let’s return to the question that we posed originally: How much did
    GDP increase in real terms? What was the real GDP growth rate from
    1960 to 2010? To find the real growth rate, we apply the formula for
    percentage change:

    2,859.5

    1960 real GDP

    2010 real GDP – 1960 real GDP<span class="s16"> </span><span
    class="s87">× 100 = % change </span>13,598.5 – 2,859.5<span
    class="s16"> </span><span class="s81">× 100 = 376%</span>

    In other words, the U.S. economy has increased real production of
    goods and services by nearly a factor of four since 1960. Of course,
    that understates the material improvement since it fails to capture
    improvements in the quality of products and the invention of new
    products.

    There is a quicker way to answer this question approximately, using
    another math trick. Because:

    Nominal = Price × Quantity

    % change in Nominal = % change in Price + % change in Quantity

    OR

    % change in Quantity = % change in Nominal – % change in Price

    Therefore, real GDP growth rate (% change in quantity) equals the
    growth rate in nominal GDP (% change in value) minus the inflation
    rate (% change in price).

    Note that using this equation provides an approximation for small
    changes in the levels. For more accurate measures, one should use
    the first formula.

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Explain recessions, depressions, peaks, and troughs

    -   Evaluate the importance of tracking real GDP over time

      

      

    When news reports indicate that “the economy grew 1.2% in the first
    quarter,” the reports are referring to the percentage change in real
    GDP. By convention, governments report GDP growth is at an
    annualized rate: Whatever the calculated growth in real GDP was for
    the quarter, we multiply it by four when it is reported as if the
    economy were growing at that rate for a full year.

    <a href="#bookmark473" id="bookmark474" class="a">Figure 6.10</a><span
    class="s54"> </span>shows the pattern of U.S. real GDP since 1900.
    Short term declines have regularly interrupted the generally upward
    long-term path of GDP. We call a significant decline in real GDP a
    **recession**. We call an especially lengthy and deep recession a
    **depression**. The severe drop in GDP that occurred during the
    1930s Great Depression is clearly visible in the figure, as is the
    2008–2009 Great Recession.<span id="bookmark475">‌</span><span
    id="bookmark476">‌</span>

    Real GDP is important because it is highly correlated with other
    measures of economic activity, like employment and unemployment.
    When real GDP rises, so does employment.

    The most significant human problem associated with recessions (and
    their larger, uglier cousins, depressions) is that a slowdown in
    production means that firms need to lay off or fire some of their
    workers. Losing a job imposes painful financial and personal costs
    on workers, and often on their extended families as well. In
    addition, even those who keep their jobs are likely to find that
    wage raises are scanty at best—or their employers may ask them to
    take pay cuts.

    <a href="#bookmark480" id="bookmark477" class="a">Table 6.7</a><span
    class="s54"> </span>lists the pattern of recessions and expansions
    in the U.S. economy since 1900. We call the highest point of the
    economy, before the recession begins, the **peak**. Conversely, the
    lowest point of a recession, before a recovery begins, is the
    **trough**. Thus, a recession lasts from peak to trough, and an
    economic upswing runs from trough to peak. We call the economy's
    movement from peak to trough and trough to peak the **business
    cycle**. It is intriguing to notice that the three longest
    trough-to-peak expansions of the twentieth century have happened
    since 1960. The most recent recession started in December 2007 and
    ended formally in June 2009. This was the most severe recession
    since the 1930s Great Depression. The ongoing expansion since the
    June 2009 trough will also be quite long, comparatively, having
    already reached 90 months at the end of 2016.<span

    id="bookmark482">‌</span>

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Explain how we can use GDP to compare the economic welfare of
        different nations

    -   Calculate the conversion of GDP to a common currency by using
        exchange rates

    -   Calculate GDP per capita using population data

      

    It is common to use GDP as a measure of economic welfare or standard
    of living in a nation. When comparing the GDP of different nations
    for this purpose, two issues immediately arise. First, we measure a
    country's GDP in its own currency: the United States uses the U.S.
    dollar; Canada, the Canadian dollar; most countries of Western
    Europe, the euro; Japan, the yen; Mexico, the peso; and so on. Thus,
    comparing GDP between two countries requires converting to a common
    currency. A second issue is that countries have very different
    numbers of people. For instance, the United States has a much larger
    economy than Mexico or Canada, but it also has almost three times as
    many people as Mexico and nine times as many people as Canada. Thus,
    if we are trying to compare standards of living across countries, we
    need to divide GDP by population.

    Converting Currencies with Exchange Rates

    <span id="bookmark483">To compare the GDP of countries with
    different currencies, it is necessary to convert to a “common
    denominator” using an</span> **exchange rate**, which is the value
    of one currency in terms of another currency. We express exchange
    rates either as the units of country A’s currency that need to be
    traded for a single unit of country B’s currency (for example,
    Japanese yen per British pound), or as the inverse (for example,
    British pounds per Japanese yen). We can use two types of exchange
    rates for this purpose, market exchange rates and purchasing power
    parity (PPP)<span id="bookmark484">‌</span>

    <a href="#bookmark690" class="s34">equivalent exchange rates. Market exchange rates vary on a day-to-day basis depending on supply and demand in foreign exchange markets. PPP-equivalent exchange rates provide a longer run measure of the exchange rate. For this reason, economists typically use PPP-equivalent exchange rates for GDP cross country comparisons. We will discuss exchange rates in more detail in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark690" class="a">Exchange Rates and International Capital</a>
    Flows<span class="p">. The following Work It Out feature explains
    how to convert GDP to a common currency.</span>

      

    Converting GDP to a Common Currency

    Using the exchange rate to convert GDP from one currency to another
    is straightforward. Say that the task is to compare Brazil’s GDP in
    2013 of 4.8 trillion reals with the U.S. GDP of $16.6 trillion for
    the same year.

    Step 1. Determine the exchange rate for the specified year. In 2013,
    the exchange rate was 2.230 reals = $1. (These numbers are
    realistic, but rounded off to simplify the calculations.)

    Step 2. Convert Brazil’s GDP into U.S. dollars:

    Brazil's GDP in $ U.S. =

          Brazil's GDP in reals     <span class="s16"> Exchange rate
    (reals/$ U.S.)</span>

    =

         4.8 trillion reals     

    2.230 reals per $ U.S.

    = $2.2 trillion

    Step 3. Compare this value to the GDP in the United States in the
    same year. The U.S. GDP was $16.6 trillion in 2013, which is nearly
    eight times that of GDP in Brazil in 2012.

    GDP Per Capita

    The U.S. economy has the largest GDP in the world, by a considerable
    amount. The United States is also a populous country; in fact, it is
    the third largest country by population in the world, although well
    behind China and India. Is the

    <span id="bookmark486">U.S. economy larger than other countries just
    because the United States has more people than most other countries,
    or because the U.S. economy is actually larger on a per-person
    basis? We can answer this question by calculating a country’s</span>
    **GDP per capita**; that is, the GDP divided by the population.

    GDP per capita = GDP/population

    <a href="#bookmark487" class="s34">The second column of</a>
    <a href="#bookmark487" class="a">Table 6.9</a>

    the population for each country. The fourth column lists the GDP per
    capita. We obtain GDP per capita in two steps: First, by multiplying
    column two (GDP, in billions of dollars) by 1000 so it has the same
    units as column three (Population, in millions). Then divide the
    result (GDP in millions of dollars) by column three (Population, in
    millions).</span>

    Notice that the ranking by GDP is different from the ranking by GDP
    per capita. India has a somewhat larger GDP than Germany, but on a
    per capita basis, Germany has more than 10 times India’s standard of
    living. Will China soon have a better standard of living than the
    U.S.? Read the following Clear It Up feature to find out.

      

    Is China going to surpass the United States in terms of standard of
    living?

    <a href="#bookmark487" class="s84">As</a> Table 6.9 <span
    class="s37">shows, China has the second largest GDP of the
    countries: $9.5 trillion compared to the United States’ $16.8
    trillion. Perhaps it will surpass the United States, but probably
    not any time soon. China has a much larger population so that in per
    capita terms, its GDP is less than one fifth that of the United
    States ($6,958.48 compared to $53,013). The Chinese people are still
    quite poor relative to the United States and other developed
    countries. One caveat: For reasons we will discuss shortly, GDP per
    capita can give us only a rough idea of the differences in living
    standards across countries.</span>

      

    The world's high-income nations—including the United States, Canada,
    the Western European countries, and Japan—typically have GDP per
    capita in the range of $20,000 to $50,000. Middle-income countries,
    which include much of Latin America, Eastern Europe, and some
    countries in East Asia, have GDP per capita in the range of $6,000
    to $12,000. The world's low-income countries, many of them located
    in Africa and Asia, often have GDP per capita of less than $2,000
    per year.

    Well GDP Measures the Well-Being of Society</span><span
    id="bookmark488">‌</span>

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Discuss how productivity influences the standard of living

    -   Explain the limitations of GDP as a measure of the standard of
        living

    -   Analyze the relationship between GDP data and fluctuations in
        the standard of living

      

    The level of GDP per capita clearly captures some of what we mean by
    the phrase “standard of living.” Most of the migration in the world,
    for example, involves people who are moving from countries with
    relatively low GDP per capita to countries with relatively high GDP
    per capita.

    <span id="bookmark489">“Standard of living” is a broader term than
    GDP. While GDP focuses on production that is bought and sold in
    markets,</span> **standard of living** includes all elements that
    affect people’s well-being, whether they are bought and sold in the
    market or not. To illuminate the difference between GDP and standard
    of living, it is useful to spell out some things that GDP does not
    cover that are clearly relevant to standard of living.

    Limitations of GDP as a Measure of the Standard of Living

    <a href="#bookmark487" class="s34">While GDP includes spending on recreation and travel, it does not cover leisure time. Clearly, however, there is a substantial difference between an economy that is large because people work long hours, and an economy that is just as large because people are more productive with their time so they do not have to work as many hours. The GDP per capita of the U.S. economy is larger than the GDP per capita of Germany, as</a>
    <a href="#bookmark487" class="a">Table 6.9</a> <span
    class="p">showed, but does that prove that the standard of living in
    the United States is higher? Not necessarily, since it is also true
    that the average U.S. worker works several hundred hours more per
    year more than the average German worker. Calculating GDP does not
    account for the German worker’s extra vacation weeks.</span>

    While GDP includes what a country spends on environmental
    protection, healthcare, and education, it does not include actual
    levels of environmental cleanliness, health, and learning. GDP
    includes the cost of buying pollution- control equipment, but it
    does not address whether the air and water are actually cleaner or
    dirtier. GDP includes spending on medical care, but does not address
    whether life expectancy or infant mortality have risen or fallen.
    Similarly, it counts spending on education, but does not address
    directly how much of the population can read, write,

      

      

    or do basic mathematics.

    <span id="bookmark490">GDP includes production that is exchanged in
    the market, but it does not cover production that is not exchanged
    in the market. For example, hiring someone to mow your lawn or clean
    your house is part of GDP, but doing these tasks yourself is not
    part of GDP. One remarkable change in the U.S. economy in recent
    decades is the growth in women’s participation in the labor force.
    As of 1970, only about 42% of women participated in the paid labor
    force. By the second decade of the 2000s, nearly 60% of women
    participated in the paid labor force according to the Bureau of
    Labor Statistics. As women are now in the labor force, many of the
    services they used to produce in the non-market economy like food
    preparation and child care have shifted to some extent into the
    market economy, which makes the GDP appear larger even if people
    actually are not consuming more services.</span>

    <span id="bookmark491">GDP has nothing to say about the level of
    inequality in society. GDP per capita is only an average. When GDP
    per capita rises by 5%, it could mean that GDP for everyone in the
    society has risen by 5%, or that GDP of some groups has risen by
    more while that of others has risen by less—or even declined. GDP
    also has nothing in particular to say about the amount of variety
    available. If a family buys 100 loaves of bread in a year, GDP does
    not care whether they are all white bread, or whether the family can
    choose from wheat, rye, pumpernickel, and many others—it just looks
    at the total amount the family spends on bread.</span>

    Likewise, GDP has nothing much to say about what technology and
    products are available. The standard of living in, for example, 1950
    or 1900 was not affected only by how much money people had—it was
    also affected by what they could buy. No matter how much money you
    had in 1950, you could not buy an iPhone or a personal computer.

    In certain cases, it is not clear that a rise in GDP is even a good
    thing. If a city is wrecked by a hurricane, and then experiences a
    surge of rebuilding construction activity, it would be peculiar to
    claim that the hurricane was therefore economically beneficial. If
    people are led by a rising fear of crime, to pay for installing bars
    and burglar alarms on all their windows, it is hard to believe that
    this increase in GDP has made them better off. Similarly, some
    people would argue that sales of certain goods, like pornography or
    extremely violent movies, do not represent a gain to society’s
    standard of living.

    Does a Rise in GDP Overstate or Understate the Rise in the Standard
    of Living?

    The fact that GDP per capita does not fully capture the broader idea
    of standard of living has led to a concern that the increases in GDP
    over time are illusory. It is theoretically possible that while GDP
    is rising, the standard of living could be falling if human health,
    environmental cleanliness, and other factors that are not included
    in GDP are worsening. Fortunately, this fear appears to be
    overstated.

    In some ways, the rise in GDP understates the actual rise in the
    standard of living. For example, the typical workweek for a U.S.
    worker has fallen over the last century from about 60 hours per week
    to less than 40 hours per week. Life expectancy and health have
    risen dramatically, and so has the average level of education. Since
    1970, the air and water in the United States have generally been
    getting cleaner. Companies have developed new technologies for
    entertainment, travel, information, and health. A much wider variety
    of basic products like food and clothing is available today than
    several decades ago. Because GDP does not capture leisure, health, a
    cleaner environment, the possibilities that new technology creates,
    or an increase in variety, the actual rise in the standard of living
    for Americans in recent decades has exceeded the rise in GDP.

    of living.</span>

    On the other side, crime rates, traffic congestion levels, and
    income inequality are higher in the United States now than they were
    in the 1960s. Moreover, a substantial number of services that women
    primarily provided in the non- market economy are now part of the
    market economy that GDP counts. By ignoring these factors, GDP would
    tend to overstate the true rise in the standard of living.

    GDP is Rough, but Useful

    A high level of GDP should not be the only goal of macroeconomic
    policy, or government policy more broadly. Even though GDP does not
    measure the broader standard of living with any precision, it does
    measure production well and it does indicate when a country is
    materially better or worse off in terms of jobs and incomes. In most
    countries, a significantly higher GDP per capita occurs hand in hand
    with other improvements in everyday life along many dimensions, like
    education, health, and environmental protection.

    How is the Economy Doing? How Does One Tell?

    To determine the state of the economy, one needs to examine economic
    indicators, such as GDP. To calculate GDP is quite an undertaking.
    It is the broadest measure of a nation’s economic activity and we
    owe a debt to Simon Kuznets, the creator of the measurement, for
    that.

    The sheer size of the U.S. economy as measured by GDP is huge—as of
    the fourth quarter of 2016, $18.9 trillion worth of goods and
    services were produced annually. Real GDP informed us that the
    2008–2009 recession was severe and that the recovery from that
    recession has been slow, but the economy is improving. GDP per
    capita gives a rough estimate of a nation’s standard of living. This
    chapter is the building block for other chapters that explore more
    economic indicators such as unemployment, inflation, or interest
    rates, and perhaps more importantly, will explain how they are
    related and what causes them to rise or fall.

    No single number can capture all the elements of a term as broad as
    “standard of living.” Nonetheless, GDP per capita is a reasonable,
    rough-and-ready measure of the standard of living.

    KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY

      

    1.  <a href="#bookmark435" class="a">Measuring the Size of the Economy: Gross Domestic</a>
        [Product](#bookmark435)

        Economists generally express the size of a nation’s economy as
        its gross domestic product (GDP), which measures the value of
        the output of all goods and services produced within the country
        in a year. Economists measure GDP by taking the quantities of
        all goods and services produced, multiplying them by their
        prices, and summing the total. Since GDP measures what is bought
        and sold in the economy, we can measure it either by the sum of
        what is purchased in the economy or what is produced.

        We can divide demand into consumption, investment, government,
        exports, and imports. We can divide what is produced in the
        economy into durable goods, nondurable goods, services,
        structures, and inventories. To avoid double counting, GDP
        counts only final output of goods and services, not the
        production of intermediate goods or the value of labor in the
        chain of production.

          

    2.  <a href="#bookmark461" class="a">Adjusting Nominal Values to Real</a>
        [Values](#bookmark461)

        The nominal value of an economic statistic is the commonly
        announced value. The real value is the value after adjusting for
        changes in inflation. To convert nominal economic data from
        several different years into real, inflation- adjusted data, the
        starting point is to choose a base year arbitrarily and then use
        a price index to convert the measurements so that economists
        measure them in the money prevailing in the base year.

          

    3.  <a href="#bookmark472" class="a">Tracking Real GDP over</a>
        [Time](#bookmark472)

        Over the long term, U.S. real GDP have increased dramatically.
        At the same time, GDP has not increased the same amount each
        year. The speeding up and slowing down of GDP growth represents
        the business cycle. When GDP declines significantly, a recession
        occurs. A longer and deeper decline is a depression. Recessions
        begin at the business cycle's peak and end at the trough.

          

    4.  <a href="#bookmark482" class="a">Comparing GDP among</a>
        [Countries](#bookmark482)

        Since we measure GDP in a country’s currency, in order to
        compare different countries’ GDPs, we need to convert them to a
        common currency. One way to do that is with the exchange rate,
        which is the price of one country’s currency in terms of
        another. Once we express GDPs in a common currency, we can
        compare each country’s GDP per capita by dividing GDP by
        population. Countries with large populations often have large
        GDPs, but GDP alone can be a misleading indicator of a nation's
        wealth. A better measure is GDP per capita.

          

    5.  <a href="#bookmark488" class="a">How Well GDP Measures the Well-Being of</a>
        [Society](#bookmark488)

GDP is an indicator of a society’s standard of living, but it is only a
rough indicator. GDP does not directly take account of leisure,
environmental quality, levels of health and education, activities
conducted outside the market, changes in inequality of income, increases
in variety, increases in technology, or the (positive or negative) value
that society may place on certain types of output.

    CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS

      

    1.  <a href="#bookmark443" class="s34">U.S. macroeconomic data are among the best in the world. Given what you learned in the</a>
        <a href="#bookmark443" class="a">Clear It Up</a> <span
        class="p">"How do statisticians measure GDP?", does this
        surprise you, or does this simply reflect the complexity of a

    2.  What does GDP not tell us about the economy?

16. How do you convert a series of nominal economic data over time to

18. What are the two main difficulties that arise in comparing different
    countries's GDP?

19. List some of the reasons why economists should not consider GDP an
    effective measure of the standard of living in a country.

  

1.  Should people typically pay more attention to their real income or
    their nominal income? If you choose the latter, why would that make
    sense in today’s world? Would your answer be the same for the 1970s?

2.  Why do you suppose that U.S. GDP is so much higher today than 50 or
    100 years ago?

      

3.  Why do you think that GDP does not grow at a steady rate, but rather
    speeds up and slows down?

4.  Cross country comparisons of GDP per capita typically use purchasing
    power parity equivalent exchange rates, which are a measure of the
    long run equilibrium value of an exchange rate. In fact, we used PPP
    equivalent exchange rates in this module. Why could using market
    exchange rates, which sometimes change dramatically in a short
    period of time, be misleading?

5.  Why might per capita GDP be only an imperfect measure of a country’s
    standard of living?

6.  How might you measure a “green” GDP?

Calories and Economic Growth

On average, humans need about 2,500 calories a day to survive, depending
on height, weight, and gender. The economist Brad DeLong estimates that
the average worker in the early 1600s earned wages that could afford him
2,500 food calories. This worker lived in Western Europe. Two hundred
years later, that same worker could afford 3,000 food calories. However,
between 1800 and 1875, just a time span of just 75 years, economic
growth was so rapid that western European workers could purchase 5,000
food calories a day. By 2012, a low skilled worker in an affluent
Western European/North American country could afford to purchase

2.4 million food calories per day.

What caused such a rapid rise in living standards between 1800 and 1875
and thereafter? Why is it that many countries, especially those in
Western Europe, North America, and parts of East Asia, can feed their
populations more than adequately, while others cannot? We will look at
these and other questions as we examine long-run economic growth.

#### Introduction to Economic Growth

In this chapter, you will learn about:

-   The Relatively Recent Arrival of Economic Growth

-   Labor Productivity and Economic Growth

-   Components of Economic Growth

      

-   Economic Convergence

  

Every country worries about economic growth. In the United States and
other high-income countries, the question is whether economic growth
continues to provide the same remarkable gains in our standard of living
as it did during the twentieth century. Meanwhile, can middle-income
countries like Brazil, Egypt, or Poland catch up to the higher- income
countries, or must they remain in the second tier of per capita income?
Of the world’s population of roughly

7.5 billion people, about 1.1 billion are scraping by on incomes that
average less than $2 per day, not that different from the standard of
living 2,000 years ago. Can the world’s poor be lifted from their
fearful poverty? As the 1995 Nobel laureate in economics, Robert E.
Lucas Jr., once noted: “The consequences for human welfare involved in
questions like these are simply staggering: Once one starts to think
about them, it is hard to think about anything else.”

Dramatic improvements in a nation’s standard of living are possible.
After the Korean War in the late 1950s, the Republic of Korea, often
called South Korea, was one of the poorest economies in the world. Most
South Koreans worked in peasant agriculture. According to the British
economist Angus Maddison, who devoted life’s work to measuring GDP and
population in the world economy, GDP per capita in 1990 international
dollars was $854 per year. From the 1960s to the early twenty-first
century, a time period well within the lifetime and memory of many
adults, the South Korean economy grew rapidly. Over these four decades,
GDP per capita increased by more than 6% per year. According to the
World Bank, GDP for South Korea now exceeds $30,000 in nominal terms,
placing it firmly among high-income countries like Italy, New Zealand,
and Israel. Measured by total GDP in 2015, South Korea is the
eleventh-largest economy in the world. For a nation of 50 million
people, this transformation is extraordinary.

South Korea is a standout example, but it is not the only case of rapid
and sustained economic growth. Other East Asian nations, like Thailand
and Indonesia, have seen very rapid growth as well. China has grown
enormously since it enacted market-oriented economic reforms around
1980. GDP per capita in high-income economies like the United States
also has grown dramatically albeit over a longer time frame. Since the
Civil War, the U.S. economy has transformed from a primarily rural and
agricultural economy to an economy based on services, manufacturing, and
technology.

    Relatively Recent Arrival of Economic Growth</span><span
    id="bookmark538">‌</span>

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Explain the conditions that have allowed for modern economic
        growth in the last two centuries

    -   Analyze the influence of public policies on an economy's
        long-run economic growth

      

    <span id="bookmark539">Let’s begin with a brief overview of
    spectacular economic growth patterns around the world in the last
    two centuries. We commonly refer to this as the period of</span>
    **modern economic growth**. (Later in the chapter we will discuss
    lower economic growth rates and some key ingredients for economic
    progress.) Rapid and sustained economic growth is a relatively
    recent experience for the human race. Before the last two centuries,
    although rulers, nobles, and conquerors could afford some
    extravagances and although economies rose above the subsistence
    level, the average person’s standard of living had not changed much
    for centuries.

    <span id="bookmark540">Progressive, powerful economic and
    institutional changes started to have a significant effect in the
    late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. According to the
    Dutch economic historian Jan Luiten van Zanden, slavery-based
    societies, favorable demographics, global trading routes, and
    standardized trading institutions that spread with different empires
    set the stage for the Industrial Revolution to succeed. The</span>
    **Industrial Revolution** refers to the widespread use of
    power-driven machinery and the economic and social changes that
    resulted in the first half of the 1800s. Ingenious machines—the
    steam engine, the power loom, and the steam locomotive—performed
    tasks that otherwise would have taken vast numbers of workers to do.
    The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain, and soon spread to
    the United States, Germany, and other countries.<span
    id="bookmark541">‌</span>

    The jobs for ordinary people working with these machines were often
    dirty and dangerous by modern standards, but the alternative jobs of
    that time in peasant agriculture and small-village industry were
    often dirty and dangerous, too. The new jobs of the Industrial
    Revolution typically offered higher pay and a chance for social
    mobility. A self- reinforcing cycle began: New inventions and
    investments generated profits, the profits provided funds for more
    new investment and inventions, and the investments and inventions
    provided opportunities for further profits. Slowly, a

    group of national economies in Europe and North America emerged from
    centuries of sluggishness into a period of rapid modern growth.
    During the last two centuries, the average GDP growth rate per
    capita in the leading industrialized countries has been about 2% per
    year. What were times like before then? Read the following Clear It
    Up feature for the answer.

      

    What were economic conditions like before 1870?

    <a href="#bookmark542" class="s84">Angus Maddison, a quantitative economic historian, led the most systematic inquiry into national incomes before 1870. Economists recently have refined and used his methods to compile GDP per capita estimates from year 1 C.E. to 1348.</a>
    <a href="#bookmark542" class="s43">Table 7.1</a> <span
    class="s37">is an important counterpoint to most of the narrative in
    this chapter. It shows that nations can decline as well as rise. A
    wide array of forces, such as epidemics, natural and weather-
    related disasters, the inability to govern large empires, and the
    remarkably slow pace of technological and institutional progress
    explain declines in income. Institutions are the traditions and laws
    by which people in a community agree to behave and govern
    themselves. Such institutions include marriage, religion, education,
    and laws of governance. Institutional progress is the development
    and codification of these institutions to reinforce social order,
    and thus, economic growth.</span>

    One example of such an institution is the Magna Carta (Great
    Charter), which the English nobles forced King John to sign in 1215.
    The Magna Carta codified the principles of due process, whereby a
    free man could not be penalized unless his peers had made a lawful
    judgment against him. The United States in its own constitution
    later adopted this concept. This social order may have contributed
    to England’s GDP per capita in 1348, which was second to that of
    northern Italy.

    <a href="#bookmark542" class="s84">In studying economic growth, a country’s institutional framework plays a critical role.</a>
    <a href="#bookmark542" class="s43">Table 7.1</a> <span
    class="s37">also shows relative global equality for almost 1,300
    years. After this, we begin to see significant divergence in income
    (not in the table).</span>

    from AD 1 to

    Another fascinating and underreported fact is the high levels of
    income, compared to others at that time, attained by the Islamic
    Empire Abbasid Caliphate—which was founded in present-day Iraq in
    730 C.E. At its height, the empire spanned large regions of the
    Middle East, North Africa, and Spain until its gradual decline over
    200 years.

      

      

    The Industrial Revolution led to increasing inequality among
    nations. Some economies took off, whereas others, like many of those
    in Africa or Asia, remained close to a subsistence standard of
    living. General calculations show that the 17 countries of the world
    with the most-developed economies had, on average, 2.4 times the GDP
    per capita of the world’s poorest economies in 1870. By 1960, the
    most developed economies had 4.2 times the GDP per capita of the
    poorest economies.

    However, by the middle of the twentieth century, some countries had
    shown that catching up was possible. Japan’s economic growth took
    off in the 1960s and 1970s, with a growth rate of real GDP per
    capita averaging 11% per year during those decades. Certain
    countries in Latin America experienced a boom in economic growth in
    the 1960s as well. In Brazil, for example, GDP per capita expanded
    by an average annual rate of 11.1% from 1968 to 1973. In the 1970s,
    some East Asian economies, including South Korea, Thailand, and
    Taiwan, saw rapid growth. In these countries, growth rates of 11% to
    12% per year in GDP per capita were not uncommon. More recently,
    China, with its population of nearly 1.4 billion people, grew at a
    per capita rate 9% per year from 1984 into the 2000s. India, with a
    population of 1.3 billion, has shown promising signs of economic
    growth, with growth in GDP per capita of about 4% per year during
    the 1990s and climbing toward 7% to 8% per year in the 2000s.

      

      

    These waves of catch-up economic growth have not reached all shores.
    In certain African countries like Niger, Tanzania, and Sudan, for
    example, GDP per capita at the start of the 2000s was still less
    than $300, not much higher than it was in the nineteenth century and
    for centuries before that. In the context of the overall situation
    of low-income people around the world, the good economic news from
    China (population: 1.4 billion) and India (population: 1.3 billion)
    is, nonetheless, astounding and heartening.

    <span id="bookmark543">Economic growth in the last two centuries has
    made a striking change in the human condition. Richard Easterlin, an
    economist at the University of Southern California, wrote in
    2000:</span>

    By many measures, a revolution in the human condition is sweeping
    the world. Most people today are better fed, clothed, and housed
    than their predecessors two centuries ago. They are healthier, live
    longer, and are better educated. Women’s lives are less centered on
    reproduction and political democracy has gained a foothold. Although
    Western Europe and its offshoots have been the leaders of this
    advance, most of the less developed nations have joined in during
    the 20th century, with the newly emerging nations of sub-Saharan
    Africa the latest to participate. Although the picture is not one of
    universal progress, it is the greatest advance in the human
    condition of the world’s population ever achieved in such a brief
    span of time.

    Rule of Law and Economic Growth

    <span id="bookmark544">Economic growth depends on many factors. Key
    among those factors is adherence to the</span> **rule of law** and
    protection of property rights and **contractual rights**
    <a href="http://cnx.org/content/m63688/latest/" class="s34">by a country’s government so that markets can work effectively and efficiently. Laws must be clear, public, fair, enforced, and equally applicable to all members of society. Property rights, as you might recall from</a>
    <a href="http://cnx.org/content/m63688/latest/" class="a">Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities (http://cnx.org/ content/m63688/latest/)</a><span
    class="s54"> </span>are the rights of individuals and firms to own
    property and use it as they see fit. If you have $100, you have the
    right to use that money, whether you spend it, lend it, or keep it
    in a jar. It is your property. The definition of property includes
    physical property as well as the right to your training and
    experience, especially<span id="bookmark545">‌</span>

      

      

    since your training is what determines your livelihood. Using this
    property includes the right to enter into contracts with other
    parties with your property. Individuals or firms must own the
    property to enter into a contract.

    Contractual rights, then, are based on property rights and they
    allow individuals to enter into agreements with others regarding the
    use of their property providing recourse through the legal system in
    the event of noncompliance. One example is the employment agreement:
    a skilled surgeon operates on an ill person and expects payment.
    Failure to pay would constitute property theft by the patient. The
    theft is property the services that the surgeon provided. In a
    society with strong property rights and contractual rights, the
    terms of the patient–surgeon contract will be fulfilled, because the
    surgeon would have recourse through the court system to extract
    payment from that individual. Without a legal system that enforces
    contracts, people would not be likely to enter into contracts for
    current or future services because of the risk of non-payment. This
    would make it difficult to transact business and would slow economic
    growth.

    The World Bank considers a country’s legal system effective if it
    upholds property rights and contractual rights. The World Bank has
    developed a ranking system for countries’ legal systems based on
    effective protection of property rights and rule-based governance
    using a scale from 1 to 6, with 1 being the lowest and 6 the highest
    rating. In 2013, the world average ranking was 2.9. The three
    countries with the lowest ranking of 1.5 were Afghanistan, the
    Central African Republic, and Zimbabwe. Their GDP per capita was
    $679, $333, and $1,007 respectively. The World Bank cites
    Afghanistan as having a low standard of living, weak government
    structure, and lack of adherence to the rule of law, which has
    stymied its economic growth. The landlocked Central African Republic
    has poor economic resources as well as political instability and is
    a source of children used in human trafficking. Zimbabwe has had
    declining and often negative growth for much of the period
    since 1998. Land redistribution and price controls have disrupted
    the economy, and corruption and violence have dominated the
    political process. Although global economic growth has increased,
    those countries lacking a clear system of property rights and an
    independent court system free from corruption have lagged far
    behind.

      

2.  <span id="bookmark532">|</span> <span style=" color: #3767B1;">Labor
    Productivity and Economic Growth</span><span
    id="bookmark546">‌</span>

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Identify the role of labor productivity in promoting economic
        growth

    -   Analyze the sources of economic growth using the aggregate
        production function

    -   Measure an economy’s rate of productivity growth

    -   Evaluate the power of sustained growth

          

        <span id="bookmark547">Sustained long-term economic growth comes
        from increases in worker productivity, which essentially means
        how well we do things. In other words, how efficient is your
        nation with its time and workers?</span> **Labor productivity**
        is the value that each employed person creates per unit of his
        or her input. The easiest way to comprehend labor productivity
        is to imagine a Canadian worker who can make 10 loaves of bread
        in an hour versus a U.S. worker who in the same hour can make
        only two loaves of bread. In this fictional example, the
        Canadians are more productive. More productivity essentially
        means you can do more in the same amount of time. This in turn
        frees up resources for workers to use elsewhere.

        <span id="bookmark548">What determines how productive workers
        are? The answer is pretty intuitive. The first determinant of
        labor productivity is human capital.</span> **Human capital** is
        the accumulated knowledge (from education and experience),
        skills, and expertise that the average worker in an economy
        possesses. Typically the higher the average level of education
        in an economy, the higher the accumulated human capital and the
        higher the labor productivity.

        <span id="bookmark549">The second factor that determines labor
        productivity is technological change.</span> **Technological
        change** is a combination of **invention**—advances in
        knowledge—and **innovation**, which is putting those advances to
        use in a new product or service. For example, the transistor was
        invented in 1947. It allowed us to miniaturize the footprint of
        electronic devices and use less power than the tube technology
        that came before it. Innovations since then have produced
        smaller and better transistors that are ubiquitous in products
        as varied as smart-phones, computers, and escalators. Developing
        the transistor has allowed workers to be anywhere with smaller
        devices. People can use these devices to communicate with other
        workers, measure product quality or do any other task in less
        time, improving worker productivity.<span

        <a href="http://cnx.org/content/m63680/latest/" class="s34">The third factor that determines labor productivity is economies of scale. Recall that economies of scale are the cost advantages that industries obtain due to size. (Read more about economies of scale in</a>

        Canadian worker who could produce 10 loaves of bread in an hour.
        If this difference in productivity was due only to economies of
        scale, it could be that the Canadian worker had access to a
        large industrial-size oven while the U.S. worker was using a
        standard residential size oven.

        Now that we have explored the determinants of worker
        productivity, let’s turn to how economists measure economic
        growth and productivity.

        Sources of Economic Growth: The Aggregate Production Function

        <span id="bookmark551">To analyze the sources of economic
        growth, it is useful to think about a</span> **production
        function**, which is the technical relationship by which
        economic inputs like labor, machinery, and raw materials are
        turned into outputs like goods and services that consumers use.
        A microeconomic production function describes a firm's or
        perhaps an industry's inputs and outputs. In macroeconomics, we
        call the connection from inputs to outputs for the entire
        economy an **aggregate production function**.<span
        id="bookmark552">‌</span>

        Components of the Aggregate Production Function

        <a href="#bookmark553" class="s34">Economists construct different production functions depending on the focus of their studies.</a>
        <a href="#bookmark553" class="a">Figure 7.2</a>

        <a href="#bookmark553" class="a">Figure 7.2</a> <span
        class="p">(a), the output is GDP. The inputs in this example are
        workforce, human capital, physical capital, and technology. We
        discuss these inputs further in the module, Components of
        Economic Growth.</span>

        Functions</span> <span class="s37">An aggregate production
        function shows what goes into producing the output for an
        overall economy. (a) This aggregate production function has GDP
        as its output. (b) This aggregate production function has GDP
        per capita as its output. Because we calculate it on a
        per-person basis, we already figure the labor input into the
        other factors and we do not need to list it separately.</span>

          

        Measuring Productivity

        An economy’s rate of productivity growth is closely linked to
        the growth rate of its GDP per capita, although the two are not
        identical. For example, if the percentage of the population who
        holds jobs in an economy increases, GDP per capita will increase
        but the productivity of individual workers may not be affected.
        Over the long term, the only way that GDP per capita can grow
        continually is if the productivity of the average worker rises
        or if there are complementary increases in capital.

        <a href="#bookmark554" class="s34">A common measure of U.S. productivity per worker is dollar value per hour the worker contributes to the employer’s output. This measure excludes government workers, because their output is not sold in the market and so their productivity is hard to measure. It also excludes farming, which accounts for only a relatively small share of the U.S. economy.</a>
        <a href="#bookmark554" class="a">Figure 7.3</a> <span
        class="p">shows an index of output per hour, with 2009 as the
        base year (when the index equals 100). The index equaled about
        106 in 2014. In 1972, the index equaled 50, which shows that
        workers have more than doubled their productivity since
        then.</span>

        worker productivity rose more quickly in the 1960s and the
        mid-1990s compared with the 1970s and 1980s. However, these
        growth-rate differences are only a few percentage points per
        year. Look carefully to see them in the changing slope of the
        line. The average U.S. worker produced over twice as much per
        hour in 2014 than he did in the early 1970s. (Source: U.S.

        <a href="#bookmark555" class="s34">According to the Department of Labor, U.S. productivity growth was fairly strong in the 1950s but then declined in the 1970s and 1980s before rising again in the second half of the 1990s and the first half of the 2000s. In fact, the rate of productivity measured by the change in output per hour worked averaged 3.2% per year from 1950 to 1970; dropped to 1.9% per year from 1970 to 1990; and then climbed back to over 2.3% from 1991 to the present, with another modest slowdown after 2001.</a>

        2000s saw productivity rebound, but then productivity sagged a
        bit in the 2000s. Some think the productivity rebound of the
        late 1990s and early 2000s marks the start of a “new economy”
        built on higher productivity growth, but we cannot determine
        this until more time has passed. (Source: U.S. Department of
        Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics.)</span>

          

        The “New Economy” Controversy

        In recent years a controversy has been brewing among economists
        about the resurgence of U.S. productivity in the second half of
        the 1990s. One school of thought argues that the United States
        had developed a “new economy” based on the extraordinary
        advances in communications and information technology of the
        1990s. The most optimistic proponents argue that it would
        generate higher average productivity growth for decades to come.
        The pessimists, alternatively, argue that even five or ten years
        of stronger productivity growth does not prove that higher
        productivity will last for the long term. It is hard to infer
        anything about long-term productivity trends during the later
        part of the 2000s, because the steep 2008-2009 recession, with
        its sharp but not completely synchronized declines in output and
        employment, complicates any interpretation. While productivity
        growth was high in 2009 and 2010 (around 3%), it has slowed down
        since then.

        <span id="bookmark557">Comparing the Economies of Two
        Countries</span>

        The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development
        (OECD) tracks data on the annual growth rate of real GDP per
        hour worked. You can find these data on the OECD data webpage
        “Growth in GDP per capita,

        <span id="bookmark556">Productivity growth is also closely
        linked to the average level of wages. Over time, the amount that
        firms are willing to pay workers will depend on the value of the
        output those workers produce. If a few employers tried to pay
        their workers less than what those workers produced, then those
        workers would receive offers of higher wages from other
        profit-seeking employers. If a few employers mistakenly paid
        their workers more than what those workers produced, those
        employers would soon end up with losses. In the long run,
        productivity per hour is the most important determinant of the
        average wage level in any economy. To learn how to compare
        economies in this regard, follow the steps in the following Work

        Step 5. For both measures, growth in Canada is greater than
        growth in Belgium for the first four years. In addition, there
        are year-to-year fluctuations. Many factors can affect growth.
        For example, one factor that may have contributed to Canada’s
        stronger growth may be its larger inflows of immigrants, who
        generally contribute to economic growth.

          

        The Power of Sustained Economic Growth

        <a href="#bookmark559" class="s34">Nothing is more important for people’s standard of living than sustained economic growth. Even small changes in the rate of growth, when sustained and compounded over long periods of time, make an enormous difference in the standard of living. Consider</a>
        <a href="#bookmark559" class="a">Table</a> 7.3<span class="p">,
        in which the rows of the table show several different rates of
        growth in GDP per capita and the columns show different periods
        of time. Assume for simplicity that an economy starts with a GDP
        per capita of 100. The table then applies the following formula
        to calculate what GDP will be at the given growth rate in the
        future:</span>

        GDP at starting date × (1 + growth rate of GDP)<span
        class="s88">years</span><span class="s89"> </span>= GDP at end
        date

        For example, an economy that starts with a GDP of 100 and grows
        at 3% per year will reach a GDP of 209 after 25 years; that is,
        100 (1.03)<span class="s28">25</span> = 209.

        The slowest rate of GDP per capita growth in the table, just 1%
        per year, is similar to what the United States experienced
        during its weakest years of productivity growth. The second
        highest rate, 3% per year, is close to what the U.S. economy
        experienced during the strong economy of the late 1990s and into
        the 2000s. Higher rates of per capita growth, such as 5% or 8%
        per year, represent the experience of rapid growth in economies
        like Japan, Korea, and China.

        <a href="#bookmark559" class="a">Table 7.3</a> <span
        class="p">shows that even a few percentage points of difference
        in economic growth rates will have a profound effect if
        sustained and compounded over time. For example, an economy
        growing at a 1% annual rate over 50 years will see its GDP per
        capita rise by a total of 64%, from 100 to 164 in this example.
        However, a country growing at a 5% annual rate will see (almost)
        the same amount of growth—from 100 to 163—over just 10 years.
        Rapid rates of economic growth can bring profound
        transformation. (See the following Clear It Up feature on the
        relationship between compound growth rates and compound interest
        rates.) If the rate of growth is 8%, young adults starting
        at</span>

          

          

        age 20 will see the average standard of living in their country
        more than double by the time they reach age 30, and grow nearly
        sixfold by the time they reach age 45.

        How are compound growth rates and compound interest rates
        related?

        <a href="#bookmark554" class="s84">The formula for GDP growth rates over different periods of time, as</a>
        <a href="#bookmark554" class="s43">Figure 7.3</a>
        <a href="#bookmark96" class="s84">shows, is exactly the same as the formula for how a given amount of financial savings grows at a certain interest rate over time, as presented in</a>
        <a href="#bookmark96" class="s43">Choice in a World of</a>
        Scarcity<span class="s37">. Both formulas have the same
        ingredients:</span>

        -   an original starting amount, in one case GDP and in the
            other case an amount of financial saving;

        -   a percentage increase over time, in one case the GDP growth
            rate and in the other case an interest rate;

        -   and an amount of time over which this effect happens.

    <span id="bookmark560">Recall that compound interest is interest
    that is earned on past interest. It causes the total amount of
    financial savings to grow dramatically over time. Similarly,
    compound rates of economic growth, or the</span> **compound growth
    rate**, means that we multiply the rate of growth by a base that
    includes past GDP growth, with dramatic effects over time.

    <a href="#bookmark561" class="s84">For example, in 2013, the Central Intelligence Agency's World Fact Book reported that South Korea had a GDP of $1.67 trillion with a growth rate of 2.8%. We can estimate that at that growth rate, South Korea’s GDP will be $1.92 trillion in five years. If we apply the growth rate to each year’s ending GDP for the next five years, we will calculate that at the end of year one, GDP is $1.72 trillion. In year two, we start with the end-of-year one value of $1.72 and increase it by 2.8%. Year three starts with the end-of-year two GDP, and we increase it by 2.8% and so on, as</a>

    Another way to calculate the growth rate is to apply the following
    formula:

    Future Value = Present Value × (1 + g) <span class="s89">n</span>

    Where “future value” is the value of GDP five years hence, “present
    value” is the starting GDP amount of $1.67 trillion, “g” is the
    growth rate of 2.8%, and “n” is the number of periods for which we
    are calculating growth.

    Future Value = 1.67 × (1+0.028) <span class="s89">5 </span>= $1.92

    id="bookmark562">‌</span>

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Discuss the components of economic growth, including physical
    capital, human capital, and technology

-   Explain capital deepening and its significance

-   Analyze the methods employed in economic growth accounting studies

-   Identify factors that contribute to a healthy climate for economic
    growth

  

Over decades and generations, seemingly small differences of a few
percentage points in the annual rate of economic growth make an enormous
difference in GDP per capita. In this module, we discuss some of the
components of economic growth, including physical capital, human
capital, and technology.

<span id="bookmark563">The category of</span> **physical capital**
includes the plant and equipment that firms use as well as things like
roads (also called **infrastructure**). Again, greater physical capital
implies more output. Physical capital can affect productivity in two
ways: (1) an increase in the *quantity* of physical capital (for
example, more computers of the same quality); and<span
id="bookmark564">‌</span>

1.  <span id="bookmark565">an increase in the</span> *quality* of
    physical capital (same number of computers but the computers are
    faster, and so on). **Human capital** refers to the skills and
    knowledge that make workers productive. Human capital and physical
    capital accumulation are similar: In both cases, investment now pays
    off in higher productivity in the future.

    <span id="bookmark566">The category of</span> **technology** is the
    “joker in the deck.” Earlier we described it as the combination of
    invention and innovation. When most people think of new technology,
    the invention of new products like the laser, the smartphone, or
    some new wonder drug come to mind. In food production, developing
    more drought-resistant seeds is another example of technology.
    Technology, as economists use the term, however, includes still
    more. It includes new ways of organizing work, like the invention of
    the assembly line, new methods for ensuring better quality of output
    in factories, and innovative institutions that facilitate the
    process of converting inputs into output. In short, technology
    comprises all the advances that make the existing machines and other
    inputs produce more, and at higher quality, as well as altogether
    new products.

    <span id="bookmark567">It may not make sense to compare the GDPs of
    China and say, Benin, simply because of the great difference in
    population size. To understand economic growth, which is really
    concerned with the growth in living standards of an average person,
    it is often useful to focus on GDP per capita. Using GDP per capita
    also makes it easier to compare countries with smaller numbers of
    people, like Belgium, Uruguay, or Zimbabwe, with countries that have
    larger populations, like the United States, the Russian Federation,
    or Nigeria.</span>

    <a href="#bookmark553" id="bookmark568" class="s34">To obtain a per capita production function, divide each input in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark553" class="a">Figure</a>
    7.2<a href="#bookmark553" class="s34">(a) by the population. This creates a second aggregate production function where the output is GDP per capita (that is, GDP divided by population). The inputs are the average level of human capital per person, the average level of physical capital per person, and the level of technology per person—see</a>

    The result of having population in the denominator is mathematically
    appealing. Increases in population lower per capita income. However,
    increasing population is important for the average person only if
    the rate of income growth exceeds population growth. A more
    important reason for constructing a per capita production function
    is to understand the contribution of human and physical
    capital.</span>

    Capital Deepening

    <span id="bookmark569">When society increases the level of capital
    per person, we call the result</span> **capital deepening**. The
    idea of capital deepening can apply both to additional human capital
    per worker and to additional physical capital per worker.

    <a href="#bookmark570" class="s34">Recall that one way to measure human capital is to look at the average levels of education in an economy.</a>
    [Figure](#bookmark570)

    <a href="#bookmark570" class="a">7.5</a> <span class="p">illustrates
    the human capital deepening for U.S. workers by showing that the
    proportion of the U.S. population with a high school and a college
    degree is rising. As recently as 1970, for example, only about half
    of U.S. adults had at least a high school diploma. By the start of
    the twenty-first century, more than 80% of adults had graduated from
    high school. The idea of human capital deepening also applies to the
    years of experience that workers have, but the average experience
    level of U.S. workers has not changed much in recent decades. Thus,
    the key dimension for deepening human capital in the U.S. economy
    focuses more on additional education and training than on a higher
    average level of work experience.</span>

    deepening of human capital to occur. (Source: US Department of

    worker of the early 1950s.</span>

    <span id="bookmark571">Figure 7.6 Physical Capital per Worker in the
    United States</span> <span class="s37">The value of the physical
    capital, measured by plant and equipment, used by the average worker
    in the U.S. economy has risen over the decades. The increase may
    have leveled off a bit in the 1970s and 1980s, which were, not
    coincidentally, times of slower-than-usual growth in worker
    productivity. We see a renewed increase in physical capital per
    worker in the late 1990s, followed by a flattening in the early
    2000s. (Source: Center for International Comparisons of Production,
    Income and Prices, University of Pennsylvania)</span>

      

    <span id="bookmark572">Not only does the current U.S. economy have
    better-educated workers with more and improved physical capital than
    it did several decades ago, but these workers have access to more
    advanced technologies. Growth in technology is impossible to measure
    with a simple line on a graph, but evidence that we live in an age
    of technological marvels is all around us—discoveries in genetics
    and in the structure of particles, the wireless internet, and other
    inventions almost too numerous to count. The U.S. Patent and
    Trademark Office typically has issued more than 150,000 patents
    annually in recent years.</span>

    This recipe for economic growth—investing in labor productivity,
    with investments in human capital and technology, as well as
    increasing physical capital—also applies to other economies. South
    Korea, for example, already achieved universal enrollment in primary
    school (the equivalent of kindergarten through sixth grade in the
    United States) by 1965, when Korea’s GDP per capita was still near
    its rock bottom low. By the late 1980s, Korea had achieved almost
    universal secondary school education (the equivalent of a high
    school education in the United States). With regard to physical
    capital, Korea’s rates of investment had been about 15% of GDP at
    the start of the 1960s, but doubled to 30–35% of GDP by the late
    1960s and early 1970s. With regard to technology, South Korean
    students went to universities and colleges around the world to
    obtain scientific and technical training, and South Korean firms
    reached out to study and form partnerships with firms that could
    offer them technological insights. These factors combined to foster
    South Korea’s high rate of economic growth.

    Growth Accounting Studies

    Since the late 1950s, economists have conducted growth accounting
    studies to determine the extent to which physical and human capital
    deepening and technology have contributed to growth. The usual
    approach uses an aggregate production function to estimate how much
    of per capita economic growth can be attributed to growth in
    physical capital and human capital. We can measure these two inputs
    at least roughly. The part of growth that is unexplained by measured
    inputs, called the residual, is then attributed to growth in
    technology. The exact numerical estimates differ from study to study
    and from country to country, depending on how researchers measured
    these three main

      

      

    factors and over what time horizons. For studies of the U.S.
    economy, three lessons commonly emerge from growth accounting
    studies.

    First, technology is typically the most important contributor to
    U.S. economic growth. Growth in human capital and physical capital
    often explains only half or less than half of the economic growth
    that occurs. New ways of doing things are tremendously important.

    Second, while investment in physical capital is essential to growth
    in labor productivity and GDP per capita, building human capital is
    at least as important. Economic growth is not just a matter of more
    machines and buildings. One vivid example of the power of human
    capital and technological knowledge occurred in Europe in the years
    after World War II (1939–1945). During the war, a large share of
    Europe’s physical capital, such as factories, roads, and vehicles,
    was destroyed. Europe also lost an overwhelming amount of human
    capital in the form of millions of men, women, and children who died
    during the war. However, the powerful combination of skilled workers
    and technological knowledge, working within a market-oriented
    economic framework, rebuilt Europe’s productive capacity to an even
    higher level within less than two decades.

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_176.png" width="624" height="51" alt="image" />

    How do girls’ education and economic growth relate in low- income
    countries?

    In the early 2000s, according to the World Bank, about 110 million
    children between the ages of 6 and 11 were not in school—and about
    two-thirds of them were girls. In Afghanistan, for example, the
    literacy rate for those aged 15-24 for the period 2005-2014 was 62%
    for males and only 32% for females. In Benin, in West Africa, it was
    55% for males and 31% for females. In Nigeria, Africa’s most
    populous country, it was 76% for males and 58 percent for females.

    Whenever any child does not receive a basic education, it is both a
    human and an economic loss. In low- income countries, wages
    typically increase by an average of 10 to 20% with each additional
    year of education. There is, however, some intriguing evidence that
    helping girls in low-income countries to close the education gap
    with boys may be especially important, because of the social role
    that many of the girls will play as mothers and homemakers.

    Girls in low-income countries who receive more education tend to
    grow up to have fewer, healthier, better- educated children. Their
    children are more likely to be better nourished and to receive basic
    health care like immunizations. Economic research on women in
    low-income economies backs up these findings. When 20 women obtain
    one additional year of schooling, as a group they will, on average,
    have one less child. When 1,000 women obtain one additional year of
    schooling, on average one to two fewer women from that group will
    die in childbirth. When a woman stays in school an additional year,
    that factor alone means that, on average, each of her children will
    spend an additional half-year in school. Education for girls is a
    good investment because it is an investment in economic growth with
    benefits beyond the current generation.

    A third lesson is that these three factors of human capital,
    physical capital, and technology work together. Workers with a
    higher level of education and skills are often better at coming up
    with new technological innovations. These technological innovations
    are often ideas that cannot increase production until they become a
    part of new investment in physical capital. New machines that embody
    technological innovations often require additional training, which
    builds worker skills further. If the recipe for economic growth is
    to succeed, an economy needs all the ingredients of the aggregate
    production function. See the following Clear It Up feature for an
    example of how human capital, physical capital, and technology can
    combine to significantly impact lives.

      

      

    A Healthy Climate for Economic Growth

    While physical and human capital deepening and better technology are
    important, equally important to a nation’s well-being is the climate
    or system within which these inputs are cultivated. Both the type of
    market economy and a legal system that governs and sustains property
    rights and contractual rights are important contributors to a
    healthy economic climate.

      

      

    A healthy economic climate usually involves some sort of market
    orientation at the microeconomic, individual, or firm
    decision-making level. Markets that allow personal and business
    rewards and incentives for increasing human and physical capital
    encourage overall macroeconomic growth. For example, when workers
    participate in a competitive and well-functioning labor market, they
    have an incentive to acquire additional human capital, because
    additional education and skills will pay off in higher wages. Firms
    have an incentive to invest in physical capital and in training
    workers, because they expect to earn higher profits for their
    shareholders. Both individuals and firms look for new technologies,
    because even small inventions can make work easier or lead to
    product improvement. Collectively, such individual and business
    decisions made within a market structure add up to macroeconomic
    growth. Much of the rapid growth since the late nineteenth century
    has come from harnessing the power of competitive markets to
    allocate resources. This market orientation typically reaches beyond
    national borders and includes openness to international trade.

    A general orientation toward markets does not rule out important
    roles for government. There are times when markets fail to allocate
    capital or technology in a manner that provides the greatest benefit
    for society as a whole. The government's role is to correct these
    failures. In addition, government can guide or influence markets
    toward certain outcomes. The following examples highlight some
    important areas that governments around the world have chosen to
    invest in to facilitate capital deepening and technology:

    -   Education. The Danish government requires all children under 16
        to attend school. They can choose to attend a public school
        (*Folkeskole*) or a private school. Students do not pay tuition
        to attend *Folkeskole*. Thirteen percent of primary/secondary
        (elementary/high) school is private, and the government supplies
        vouchers to citizens who choose private school.

    -   Savings and Investment. In the United States, as in other
        countries, the government taxes gains from private investment.
        Low capital gains taxes encourage investment and so also
        economic growth.

    -   Infrastructure. The Japanese government in the mid-1990s
        undertook significant infrastructure projects to improve roads
        and public works. This in turn increased the stock of physical
        capital and ultimately economic growth.

    -   <span id="bookmark573">Special Economic Zones. The island of
        Mauritius is one of the few African nations to encourage
        international trade in government-supported</span> **special
        economic zones (SEZ)**. These are areas of the country, usually
        with access to a port where, among other benefits, the
        government does not tax trade. As a result of its SEZ, Mauritius
        has enjoyed above-average economic growth since the 1980s. Free
        trade does not have to occur in an SEZ however. Governments can
        encourage international trade across the board, or surrender to
        protectionism.

    -   <span id="bookmark574">Scientific Research. The European Union
        has strong programs to invest in scientific research. The
        researchers Abraham García and Pierre Mohnen demonstrate that
        firms which received support from the Austrian government
        actually increased their research intensity and had more sales.
        Governments can support scientific research and technical
        training that helps to create and spread new technologies.
        Governments can also provide a legal environment that protects
        the ability of inventors to profit from their inventions.</span>

    <a href="#bookmark1530" class="s34">There are many more ways in which the government can play an active role in promoting economic growth. We explore them in other chapters and in particular in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1530" class="a">Macroeconomic Policy Around the</a>
    World<span class="p">. A healthy climate for growth in GDP per
    capita and labor productivity includes human capital deepening,
    physical capital deepening, and technological gains, operating in a
    market-oriented economy with supportive government policies.</span>

    <span id="bookmark576">Some low-income and middle-income economies

    its own unique story of investments in human and physical capital,
    technological gains, market forces, government policies, and even
    lucky events, but an overall pattern of convergence is clear. The
    low-income countries have GDP growth that is faster than that of the
    middle-income countries, which in turn have GDP growth that is
    faster than that of the high-income countries. Two prominent members
    of the fast- growth club are China and India, which between them
    have nearly 40% of the world’s population. Some prominent members of
    the slow-growth club are high-income countries like France, Germany,
    Italy, and Japan.</span>

    Will this pattern of economic convergence persist into the future?
    This is a controversial question among economists that we will
    consider by looking at some of the main arguments on both sides.

    Arguments Favoring Convergence

    Several arguments suggest that low-income countries might have an
    advantage in achieving greater worker productivity and economic
    growth in the future.

    <span id="bookmark578">A first argument is based on diminishing
    marginal returns. Even though deepening human and physical capital
    will tend to increase GDP per capita, the law of diminishing returns
    suggests that as an economy continues to increase its human and
    physical capital, the marginal gains to economic growth will
    diminish. For example, raising the average education level of the
    population by two years from a tenth-grade level to a high school
    diploma (while holding all other inputs constant) would produce a
    certain increase in output. An additional two-year increase, so that
    the average person had a two-year college degree, would increase
    output further, but the marginal gain would be smaller. Yet another
    additional two-year increase in the level of education, so that the
    average person would have a four-year- college bachelor’s degree,
    would increase output still further, but the marginal increase would
    again be smaller. A similar lesson holds for physical capital. If
    the quantity of physical capital available to the average worker
    increases, by, say, $5,000 to $10,000 (again, while holding all
    other inputs constant), it will increase the level of output. An
    additional increase from $10,000 to $15,000 will increase output
    further, but the marginal increase will be smaller.</span>

    Low-income countries like China and India tend to have lower levels
    of human capital and physical capital, so an investment in capital
    deepening should have a larger marginal effect in these countries
    than in high-income countries, where levels of human and physical
    capital are already relatively high. Diminishing returns implies
    that low-income economies could converge to the levels that the
    high-income countries achieve.

    <span id="bookmark579">A second argument is that low-income
    countries may find it easier to improve their technologies than
    high-income countries. High-income countries must continually invent
    new technologies, whereas low-income countries can often find ways
    of applying technology that has already been invented and is well
    understood. The economist Alexander Gerschenkron (1904–1978) gave
    this phenomenon a memorable name: “the advantages of backwardness.”
    Of course, he did not literally mean that it is an advantage to have
    a lower standard of living. He was pointing out that a country that
    is behind has some extra potential for catching up.</span>

    Finally, optimists argue that many countries have observed the
    experience of those that have grown more quickly and have learned
    from it. Moreover, once the people of a country begin to enjoy the
    benefits of a higher standard of living, they may be more likely to
    build and support the market-friendly institutions that will help
    provide this standard of living.

    Arguments That Convergence Is neither Inevitable nor Likely

    If the economy's growth depended only on the deepening of human
    capital and physical capital, then we would expect that economy's
    growth rate to slow down over the long run because of diminishing
    marginal returns. However, there is another crucial factor in the
    aggregate production function: technology.

    <a href="#bookmark580" class="s34">Developing new technology can provide a way for an economy to sidestep the diminishing marginal returns of capital deepening.</a>
    <a href="#bookmark580" class="a">Figure 7.7</a><span class="s54">
    </span>shows how. The figure's horizontal axis measures the amount
    of capital deepening, which on this figure is an overall measure
    that includes deepening of both physical and human capital. The
    amount of human and physical capital per worker increases as you
    move from left to right, from C<span class="s60">1</span> to C<span
    class="s60">2</span> to C<span class="s60">3</span>. The diagram's
    vertical axis measures per capita output. Start by considering the
    lowest line in this diagram, labeled Technology 1. Along this
    aggregate production function, the level of technology is held
    constant, so the line shows only the relationship between capital
    deepening and output. As capital deepens from C<span
    class="s60">1</span> to C<span class="s60">2</span> to C<span
    class="s60">3</span> and the economy moves from R to U to W, per
    capita output does increase—but the way in which the line starts out
    steeper on the left but then flattens as it moves to the right shows
    the diminishing marginal returns, as additional marginal amounts of
    capital deepening increase output by ever-smaller amounts. The shape
    of the aggregate production line (Technology 1) shows that the
    ability of capital deepening, by itself, to generate sustained
    economic growth is limited, since diminishing returns will
    eventually set in.

      

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_180.jpg" width="252" height="176" alt="image" />

    <span id="bookmark580"><span class="s36">Figure 7.7 Capital
    Deepening and New Technology </span></span>Imagine that the economy
    starts at point R, with the level of physical and human capital
    C<span class="s63">1</span> and the output per capita at G<span
    class="s63">1</span>. If the economy relies only on capital
    deepening, while remaining at the technology level shown by the
    Technology 1 line, then it would face diminishing marginal returns
    as it moved from point R to point U to point W. However, now imagine
    that capital deepening is combined with improvements in technology.
    Then, as capital deepens from C<span class="s63">1</span> to C<span
    class="s63">2</span>, technology improves from Technology 1 to
    Technology 2, and the economy moves from R to S. Similarly, as
    capital deepens from C<span class="s63">2</span> to C<span
    class="s63">3</span>, technology increases from Technology 2 to
    Technology 3, and the economy moves from S to T. With improvements
    in technology, there is no longer any reason that economic growth
    must necessarily slow down.

      

    Now, bring improvements in technology into the picture. Improved
    technology means that with a given set of inputs, more output is
    possible. The production function labeled Technology 1 in the figure
    is based on one level of technology, but Technology 2 is based on an
    improved level of technology, so for every level of capital
    deepening on

      

    the horizontal axis, it produces a higher level of output on the
    vertical axis. In turn, production function Technology 3 represents
    a still higher level of technology, so that for every level of
    inputs on the horizontal axis, it produces a higher level of output
    on the vertical axis than either of the other two aggregate
    production functions.

    Most healthy, growing economies are deepening their human and
    physical capital and increasing technology at the same time. As a
    result, the economy can move from a choice like point R on the
    Technology 1 aggregate production line to a point like S on
    Technology 2 and a point like T on the still higher aggregate
    production line (Technology 3). With the combination of technology
    and capital deepening, the rise in GDP per capita in high-income
    countries does not need to fade away because of diminishing returns.
    The gains from technology can offset the diminishing returns
    involved with capital deepening.

    Will technological improvements themselves run into diminishing
    returns over time? That is, will it become continually harder and
    more costly to discover new technological improvements? Perhaps
    someday, but, at least over the last two centuries since the
    beginning of the Industrial Revolution, improvements in technology
    have not run into diminishing marginal returns. Modern inventions,
    like the internet or discoveries in genetics or materials science,
    do not seem to provide smaller gains to output than earlier
    inventions like the steam engine or the railroad. One reason that
    technological ideas do not seem to run into diminishing returns is
    that we often can apply widely the ideas of new technology at a
    marginal cost that is very low or even zero. A specific worker or
    group of workers must use a specific additional machine, or an
    additional year of education. Many workers across the economy can
    use a new technology or invention at very low marginal cost.

    The argument that it is easier for a low-income country to copy and
    adapt existing technology than it is for a high-income country to
    invent new technology is not necessarily true, either. When it comes
    to adapting and using new technology, a society’s performance is not
    necessarily guaranteed, but is the result of whether the country's
    economic, educational, and public policy institutions are
    supportive. In theory, perhaps, low-income countries have many
    opportunities to copy and adapt technology, but if they lack the
    appropriate supportive economic infrastructure and institutions, the
    theoretical possibility that backwardness might have certain
    advantages is of little practical relevance.

      

      

    The Slowness of Convergence

    Although economic convergence between the high-income countries and
    the rest of the world seems possible and even likely, it will
    proceed slowly. Consider, for example, a country that starts off
    with a GDP per capita of $40,000, which would roughly represent a
    typical high-income country today, and another country that starts
    out at $4,000, which is roughly the level in low-income but not
    impoverished countries like Indonesia, Guatemala, or Egypt. Say that
    the rich country chugs along at a 2% annual growth rate of GDP per
    capita, while the poorer country grows at the aggressive rate of 7%
    per year. After 30 years, GDP per capita in the rich country will be
    $72,450 (that is, $40,000 (1

    \+ 0.02)<span class="s28">30</span>) while in the poor country it
    will be $30,450 (that is, $4,000 (1 + 0.07)<span
    class="s28">30</span>). Convergence has occurred. The rich country
    used to be 10 times as wealthy as the poor one, and now it is only
    about 2.4 times as wealthy. Even after 30 consecutive years of very
    rapid growth, however, people in the low-income country are still
    likely to feel quite poor compared to people in the rich country.
    Moreover, as the poor country catches up, its opportunities for
    catch-up growth are reduced, and its growth rate may slow down
    somewhat.

      

      

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_182.png" width="624" height="492" alt="image" />

    The slowness of convergence illustrates again that small differences
    in annual rates of economic growth become huge differences over
    time. The high-income countries have been building up their
    advantage in standard of living over decades—more than a century in
    some cases. Even in an optimistic scenario, it will take decades for
    the low-income countries of the world to catch up significantly.

      

    Calories and Economic Growth

    <span id="bookmark581">We can tell the story of modern economic
    growth by looking at calorie consumption over time. The dramatic
    rise in incomes allowed the average person to eat better and consume
    more calories. How did these incomes increase? The neoclassical
    growth consensus uses the aggregate production function to suggest
    that the period of modern economic growth came about because of
    increases in inputs such as technology and physical and human
    capital. Also important was the way in which technological progress
    combined with physical and human capital deepening to create growth
    and convergence. The issue of distribution of income
    notwithstanding, it is clear that the average worker can afford more
    calories in 2017 than in 1875.</span>

    Aside from increases in income, there is another reason why the
    average person can afford more food. Modern agriculture has allowed
    many countries to produce more food than they need. Despite having
    more than enough food, however, many governments and multilateral
    agencies have not solved the food distribution problem. In fact,
    food shortages, famine, or general food insecurity are caused more
    often by the failure of government macroeconomic policy, according
    to the Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen. Sen has conducted
    extensive research into issues of inequality, poverty, and the role
    of government in improving standards of living. Macroeconomic
    policies that strive toward stable inflation, full employment,
    education of women, and preservation of property rights are more
    likely to eliminate starvation and provide for a more even
    distribution of food.

    Because we have more food per capita, global food prices have
    decreased since 1875. The prices of some foods, however, have
    decreased more than the prices of others. For example, researchers
    from the University of Washington have shown that in the United
    States, calories from zucchini and lettuce are 100 times more
    expensive than calories from oil, butter, and sugar. Research from
    countries like India, China, and the United States suggests that as
    incomes rise, individuals want more calories from fats and protein
    and fewer from carbohydrates. This has very interesting implications
    for global food production, obesity, and environmental consequences.
    Affluent urban India has an obesity problem much like many parts of
    the United States. The forces of convergence are at work.

    KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY

      

    1.  <a href="#bookmark538" class="a">The Relatively Recent Arrival of Economic</a>
        [Growth](#bookmark538)

        Since the early nineteenth century, there has been a spectacular
        process of long-run economic growth during which the world’s
        leading economies—mostly those in Western Europe and North
        America—expanded GDP per capita at an average rate of about 2%
        per year. In the last half-century, countries like Japan, South
        Korea, and China have shown the potential to catch up. The
        Industrial Revolution facilitated the extensive process of
        economic growth, that economists often refer to as modern
        economic growth. This increased worker productivity and trade,
        as well as the

          

          

        development of governance and market institutions.

          

    2.  <a href="#bookmark546" class="a">Labor Productivity and Economic</a>
        [Growth](#bookmark546)

        We can measure productivity, the value of what is produced per
        worker, or per hour worked, as the level of GDP per worker or
        GDP per hour. The United States experienced a productivity
        slowdown between 1973 and 1989. Since then,

        U.S. productivity has rebounded for the most part, but annual
        growth in productivity in the nonfarm business sector has been
        less than one percent each year between 2011 and 2016. It is not
        clear what productivity growth will be in the coming years. The
        rate of productivity growth is the primary determinant of an
        economy’s rate of long-term economic growth and higher wages.
        Over decades and generations, seemingly small differences of a
        few percentage points in the annual rate of economic growth make
        an enormous difference in GDP per capita. An aggregate
        production function specifies how certain inputs in the economy,
        like human capital, physical capital, and technology, lead to
        the output measured as GDP per capita.

        Compound interest and compound growth rates behave in the same
        way as productivity rates. Seemingly small changes in percentage
        points can have big impacts on income over time.

          

    3.  <a href="#bookmark562" class="a">Components of Economic</a>
        [Growth](#bookmark562)

        Over decades and generations, seemingly small differences of a
        few percentage points in the annual rate of economic growth make
        an enormous difference in GDP per capita. Capital deepening
        refers to an increase in the amount of capital per worker,
        either human capital per worker, in the form of higher education
        or skills, or physical capital per worker. Technology, in its
        economic meaning, refers broadly to all new methods of
        production, which includes major scientific inventions but also
        small inventions and even better forms of management or other
        types of institutions. A healthy climate for growth in GDP per
        capita consists of improvements in human capital, physical
        capital, and technology, in a market-oriented environment with
        supportive public policies and institutions.

          

    4.  <a href="#bookmark575" class="a">Economic</a>
        [Convergence](#bookmark575)

When countries with lower GDP levels per capita catch up to countries
with higher GDP levels per capita, we call the process convergence.
Convergence can occur even when both high- and low-income countries
increase investment in physical and human capital with the objective of
growing GDP. This is because the impact of new investment in physical
and human capital on a low-income country may result in huge gains as
new skills or equipment combine with the labor force. In higher-income
countries, however, a level of investment equal to that of the low
income country is not likely to have as big an impact, because the more
developed country most likely already has high levels of capital
investment. Therefore, the marginal gain from this additional investment
tends to be successively less and less. Higher income countries are more
likely to have diminishing returns to their investments and must
continually invent new technologies. This allows lower-income economies
to have a chance for convergent growth. However, many high-income
economies have developed economic and political institutions that
provide a healthy economic climate for an ongoing stream of
technological innovations. Continuous technological innovation can
counterbalance diminishing returns to investments in human and physical
capital.

    REVIEW QUESTIONS

      

13. How did the Industrial Revolution increase the economic growth rate
    and income levels in the United States?

14. How much should a nation be concerned if its rate of economic growth
    is just 2% slower than other nations?

    CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS

      

    1.  Over the past 50 years, many countries have experienced an
        annual growth rate in real GDP per capita greater than that of
        the United States. Some examples are China, Japan, South Korea,
        and Taiwan. Does that mean the United States is regressing
        relative to other countries? Does that mean these countries will
        eventually overtake the United States in terms of the growth
        rate of real GDP per capita? Explain.

18. What is capital deepening?

19. What do economists mean when they refer to improvements in
    technology?

20. For a high-income economy like the United States, what aggregate

    Brazil? A low-income country such as Niger?

21. List some arguments for and against the likelihood of convergence.

  

1.  Change in labor productivity is one of the most watched
    international statistics of growth. Visit the St. Louis Federal
    Reserve website and find the data section
    (http://research.stlouisfed.org). Find international comparisons of
    labor productivity, listed under the FRED Economic database (Growth
    Rate of Total Labor Productivity), and compare two countries in the
    recent past. State what you think the reasons for differences in
    labor productivity could be.

    the data for the two countries you chose. How are they similar? How
    are they different?</span>

      

3.  Education seems to be important for human capital deepening. As
    people become better educated and more knowledgeable, are there
    limits to how much additional benefit more education can provide?
    Why or why not?

4.  Describe some of the political and social tradeoffs that might occur
    when a less developed country adopts a strategy to promote labor
    force participation and economic growth via investment in girls’
    education.

6.  How is the concept of technology, as defined with the aggregate
    production function, different from our everyday use of the word?

    increase, obesity is likely. What factors do you think may limit
    obesity?

      

    PROBLEMS

9.  An economy starts off with a GDP per capita of

    $5,000. How large will the GDP per capita be if it grows at an
    annual rate of 2% for 20 years? 2% for 40 years?

    4% for 40 years? 6% for 40 years?

10. An economy starts off with a GDP per capita of 12,000 euros. How
    large will the GDP per capita be if it grows at an annual rate of 3%
    for 10 years? 3% for 30 years? 6% for 30 years?

      

11. Say that the average worker in Canada has a productivity level of
    $30 per hour while the average worker in the United Kingdom has a
    productivity level of $25 per hour (both measured in U.S. dollars).
    Over the next five years, say that worker productivity in Canada
    grows at 1% per year while worker productivity in the UK grows 3%
    per year. After five years, who will have the higher productivity
    level, and by how much?

12. Say that the average worker in the U.S. economy is eight times as
    productive as an average worker in Mexico. If the productivity of
    U.S. workers grows at 2% for 25 years and the productivity of
    Mexico’s workers grows at 6% for 25 years, which country will have
    higher worker productivity at that point?

Unemployment and the Great Recession

Nearly eight million U.S. jobs were lost as a consequence of the Great
Recession, which lasted from December 2007 to June 2009. At the outset
of the recession, the unemployment rate was 5.0%. The rate began rising
several months after the recession began, and it peaked at 10.0% in
October 2009, several months after the recession ended, according to the
Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The job loss represented a huge number
of positions gone. Subsequently, the recovery was tepid. Companies added
some positions, but as of summer 2013, four years after the end of the
recession, unemployment was about 7.5%, well above the pre-recession
rate. Employment began increasing at the outset of 2010, and reached its
pre-recession level in mid-2014. However, because of population and
labor force growth, the unemployment rate at that point was still
slightly above 6%. The economy only returned to an unemployment rate of
5.0% in September 2015, and it has remained at or slightly below that
level since then, up through January 2017.

This brief overview of unemployment during and after the Great Recession
highlights a few important points. First, unemployment is a lagging
indicator of business activity. It didn’t begin to increase until a few
months after the onset of the recession, and it didn’t begin to decline
until several months after the recovery. Second, the decline in the
unemployment rate was quite slow, with the pre-recession unemployment
rate only reaching a higher level than six years after the recession
ended. This reflects a combination of slow increase in the number of
jobs and ongoing increases in the size of the population and the labor
force.

It turns out that recent recessions, going back to the early 1990s, have
been characterized by longer periods of recovery than their
predecessors. We will return to this point at the end of the chapter.
However, first we

need to examine unemployment. What constitutes it, and how do we measure
it?

  

#### Introduction to Unemployment

In this chapter, you will learn about:

-   How Economists Define and Compute Unemployment Rate

-   Patterns of Unemployment

-   What Causes Changes in Unemployment over the Short Run

-   What Causes Changes in Unemployment over the Long Run

  

Unemployment can be a terrible and wrenching life experience—like a
serious automobile accident or a messy divorce—whose consequences only
someone who has gone through it can fully understand. For unemployed
individuals and their families, there is the day-to-day financial stress
of not knowing from where the next paycheck is coming. There are painful
adjustments, like watching your savings account dwindle, selling a car
and buying a cheaper one, or moving to a less expensive place to live.
Even when the unemployed person finds a new job, it may pay less than
the previous one. For many people, their job is an important part of
their self worth. When unemployment separates people from the workforce,
it can affect family relationships as well as mental and physical
health.

<span id="bookmark620">The human costs of unemployment alone would
justify making a low level of unemployment an important public policy
priority. However, unemployment also includes economic costs to the
broader society. When millions of unemployed but willing workers cannot
find jobs, economic resource are unused. An economy with high
unemployment is like a company operating with a functional but unused
factory. The opportunity cost of unemployment is the output that the
unemployed workers could have produced.</span>

This chapter will discuss how economists define and compute the
unemployment rate. It will examine the patterns of unemployment over
time, for the U.S. economy as a whole, for different demographic groups
in the U.S. economy, and for other countries. It will then consider an
economic explanation for unemployment, and how it explains the patterns
of unemployment and suggests public policies for reducing it.

    Economists Define and Compute Unemployment Rate</span><span
    id="bookmark621">‌</span>

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Calculate the labor force participation rate and the
        unemployment rate

    -   Explain hidden unemployment and what it means to be in or out of
        the labor force

    -   Evaluate the collection and interpretation of unemployment data

      

    Newspaper or television reports typically describe unemployment as a
    percentage or a rate. A recent report might have said, for example,
    *from August 2009 to November 2009, the U.S. unemployment rate rose
    from 9.7% to 10.0%, but by June 2010, it had fallen to 9.5%*. At a
    glance, the changes between the percentages may seem small. However,
    remember that the U.S. economy has about 160 million adults (as of
    the beginning of 2017) who either have jobs or are looking for them.
    A rise or fall of just 0.1% in the unemployment rate of 160 million
    potential workers translates into 160,000 people, which is roughly
    the total population of a city like Syracuse, New York, Brownsville,
    Texas, or Pasadena, California. Large rises in the unemployment rate
    mean large numbers of job losses. In November 2009, at the peak of
    the recession, about 15 million people were out of work. Even with
    the unemployment rate now at 4.8% as of January 2017, about 7.6
    million people who would like to have jobs are out of work.

    (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/BLS1) <span
    style=" color: #000;">tracks and reports all data related to
    unemployment.</span>

    Who’s In or Out of the Labor Force?

    Should we count everyone without a job as unemployed? Of course not.
    For example, we should not count children as unemployed. Surely, we
    should not count the retired as unemployed. Many full-time college
    students have only a part-time job, or no job at all, but it seems
    inappropriate to count them as suffering the pains of unemployment.
    Some people are not working because they are rearing children, ill,
    on vacation, or on parental leave.

    <span id="bookmark622">The point is that we do not just divide the
    adult population into employed and unemployed. A third group exists:
    people who do not have a job, and for some reason—retirement,
    looking after children, taking a voluntary break before a new
    job—are not interested in having a job, either. It also includes
    those who do want a job but have quit looking, often due to
    discouragement due to their inability to find suitable employment.
    Economists refer to this third group of those who are not working
    and not looking for work as</span> **out of the labor force** or not
    in the labor force.

    The U.S. unemployment rate, which is based on a monthly survey
    carried out by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, asks a series of
    questions to divide the adult population into employed, unemployed,
    or not in the labor force. To be classified as unemployed, a person
    must be without a job, currently available to work, and actively
    looking for work in the previous four weeks. Thus, a person who does
    not have a job but who is not currently available to work or has not
    actively looked for work in the last four weeks is counted as out of
    the labor force.

    Employed: currently working for pay

    Unemployed: Out of work and actively looking for a job

    Out of the labor force: Out of paid work and not actively looking
    for a job Labor force: the number of employed plus the unemployed

    Calculating the Unemployment Rate

    <a href="#bookmark625" class="s34">shows the three-way division of the 16-and-over population. In January 2017, about 62.9% of the adult population was "in the labor force"; that is, people are either employed or without a job but looking for work.

    Calculating Labor Force Percentages

    <a href="#bookmark625" class="s84">How do economists arrive at the percentages in and out of the labor force and the unemployment rate? We will use the values in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark625" class="s43">Table</a> 8.1 <span
    class="s37">to illustrate the steps.</span>

    To determine the percentage in the labor force:

    Step 1. Divide the number of people in the labor force (159.716
    million) by the total adult (working-age) population (254.082
    million).

    Step 2. Multiply by 100 to obtain the percentage.

    In this example, we can calculate the unemployment rate as 7.635
    million unemployed people divided by 159.716 million people in the
    labor force, which works out to a 4.8% rate of unemployment. The
    following Work It Out feature will walk you through the steps of
    this calculation.

      

      

      

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_188.png" width="624" height="354" alt="image" />

    Percentage in the labor force =

    159.716

    = 0.6286

    = 62.9%

    254.082

    To determine the percentage out of the labor force:

    Step 1. Divide the number of people out the labor force (94.366
    million) by the total adult (working-age) population (254.082
    million).

    Step 2. Multiply by 100 to obtain the percentage.

    Percentage in the labor force = <u>94.366</u>

    = 0.3714

    = 37.1%

    254.082

    To determine the unemployment rate:

    Step 1. Divide the number of unemployed people (7.635 million) by
    the total labor force (157 million). Step 2. Multiply by 100 to
    obtain the rate.

    Unemployment rate = <u>   7.635  </u>

    159.716

    = 0.0478

    = 4.8%

    Hidden Unemployment

    <span id="bookmark626">Even with the “out of the labor force”
    category, there are still some people who are mislabeled in the
    categorization of employed, unemployed, or out of the labor force.
    There are some people who have only part time or temporary jobs, and
    they are looking for full time and permanent employment that are
    counted as employed, although they are not employed in the way they
    would like or need to be. Additionally, there are individuals who
    are</span> **underemployed**. This includes those who are trained or
    skilled for one type or level of work but are working in a lower
    paying job or one that does not utilize their skills. For example,
    we would consider an individual with a college degree in finance who
    is working as a sales clerk underemployed. They are, however, also
    counted in the employed group. All of these individuals fall under
    the umbrella of the term “hidden unemployment.” **Discouraged
    workers**, those who have stopped looking for employment and, hence,
    are no longer counted in the unemployed also fall into this
    group<span id="bookmark627">‌</span>

    Labor Force Participation Rate

    <span id="bookmark628"><span class="p">Another important statistic
    is the </span></span><span class="s31">labor force participation
    rate</span><a href="#bookmark624" class="s34">. This is the percentage of adults in an economy who are either employed or who are unemployed and looking for a job. Using the data in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark624" class="a">Figure 8.2</a>
    <a href="#bookmark625" class="s34">and</a>
    <a href="#bookmark625" class="a">Table</a> 8.1<span class="p">,
    those included in this calculation would be the 159.716 million
    individuals in the labor force. We calculate the rate by taking the
    number of people in the labor force, that is, the number employed
    and the number unemployed, divided by the total adult population and
    multiplying by 100 to get the percentage. For the data from January
    2017, the labor force participation rate is 62.9%. Historically, the
    civilian labor force participation rate in the United States climbed
    beginning in the 1960s as women increasingly entered the workforce,
    and it peaked at just over 67% in late 1999 to early 2000. Since
    then, the labor force participation rate has steadily declined,
    slowly to about 66% in 2008, early in the Great Recession, and then
    more rapidly during and after that recession, reaching its present
    level, where it has remained stable, near the end of 2013.</span>

    The Establishment Payroll Survey

    When the unemployment report comes out each month, the Bureau of
    Labor Statistics (BLS) also reports on the number of jobs
    created—which comes from the establishment payroll survey. The
    payroll survey is based on a survey of about 147,000 businesses and
    government agencies throughout the United States. It generates
    payroll employment estimates by the following criteria: all
    employees, average weekly hours worked, and average hourly, weekly,
    and overtime earnings. One of the criticisms of this survey is that
    it does not count the self-employed. It also does not make a
    distinction between new, minimum wage, part time or temporary jobs
    and full time jobs with “decent” pay.

    How Does the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Collect the U.S.

      

    Unemployment Data?

    The unemployment rate announced by the U.S. Bureau of Labor
    Statistics on the first Friday of each month for the previous month
    is based on the Current Population Survey (CPS), which the Bureau
    has carried out every month since 1940. The Bureau takes great care
    to make this survey representative of the country as a whole. The
    country is first divided into 3,137 areas. The U.S. Bureau of the
    Census then selects 729 of these areas to survey. It divides the 729
    areas into districts of about 300 households each, and divides each
    district into clusters of about four dwelling units. Every month,
    Census Bureau employees call about 15,000 of the four-household
    clusters, for a total of 60,000 households. Employees interview
    households for four consecutive months, then rotate them out of the
    survey for eight months, and then interview them again for the same
    four months the following year, before leaving the sample
    permanently.

    What is the difference between CPS and EPS?

    The United States Census Bureau conducts the Current Population
    Survey (CPS), which measures the percentage of the labor force that
    is unemployed. The Bureau of Labor Statistics' establishment payroll
    survey (EPS) is a payroll survey that measures the net change in
    jobs created for the month.

    Based on this survey, state, industry, urban and rural areas,
    gender, age, race or ethnicity, and level of education statistics
    comprise components that contribute to unemployment rates. A wide
    variety of other information is available, too. For example, how
    long have people been unemployed? Did they become unemployed because
    they quit, or were laid off, or their employer went out of business?
    Is the unemployed person the only wage earner in the family? The
    Current Population Survey is a treasure trove of information about
    employment and unemployment. If you are wondering what the
    difference is between the CPS and EPS, read the following Clear it
    Up feature.

      

      

    Criticisms of Measuring Unemployment

    There are always complications in measuring the number of
    unemployed. For example, what about people who do not have jobs and
    would be available to work, but are discouraged by the lack of
    available jobs in their area and stopped looking? Such people, and
    their families, may be suffering the pains of unemployment. However,
    the survey counts them as out of the labor force because they are
    not actively looking for work. Other people may tell the Census
    Bureau that they are ready to work and looking for a job but, truly,
    they are not that eager to work and are not looking very hard at
    all. They are counted as unemployed, although they might more
    accurately be classified as out of the labor force. Still other
    people may have a job, perhaps doing something like yard work, child
    care, or cleaning houses, but are not reporting the income earned to
    the tax authorities. They may report being unemployed, when they
    actually are working.

    Although the unemployment rate gets most of the public and media
    attention, economic researchers at the Bureau of Labor Statistics
    publish a wide array of surveys and reports that try to measure
    these kinds of issues and to develop a more nuanced and complete
    view of the labor market. It is not exactly a hot news flash that
    economic statistics are imperfect. Even imperfect measures like the
    unemployment rate, however, can still be quite informative, when
    interpreted knowledgeably and sensibly.

2.  <span id="bookmark614">|</span> <span
    style=" color: #3767B1;">Patterns of Unemployment</span><span
    id="bookmark629">‌</span>

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Explain historical patterns of unemployment in the U.S.

    -   Identify trends of unemployment based on demographics

    -   Evaluate global unemployment rates

      

    Let’s look at how unemployment rates have changed over time and how
    various groups of people are affected by unemployment differently.

    The Historical U.S. Unemployment Rate

    <a href="#bookmark630" class="a">Figure 8.3</a> <span
    class="p">shows the historical pattern of U.S. unemployment
    since 1955.</span>

      

      

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_192.jpg" width="365" height="243" alt="image" />

    <span id="bookmark630">Figure 8.3 The U.S. Unemployment Rate,
    1955–2015</span> <span class="s37">The U.S. unemployment rate moves
    up and down as the economy moves in and out of recessions. However,
    over time, the unemployment rate seems to return to a range of 4% to
    6%. There does not seem to be a long-term trend toward the rate
    moving generally higher or generally lower. (Source: Federal Reserve
    Economic Data (FRED)
    https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/LRUN64TTUSA156S0)</span><span
    id="bookmark631">‌</span>

      

    As we look at this data, several patterns stand out:

    1.  Unemployment rates do fluctuate over time. During the deep
        recessions of the early 1980s and of 2007–2009, unemployment
        reached roughly 10%. For comparison, during the 1930s Great
        Depression, the unemployment rate reached almost 25% of the
        labor force.

    2.  Unemployment rates in the late 1990s and into the mid-2000s were
        rather low by historical standards. The unemployment rate was
        below 5% from 1997 to 2000, and near 5% during almost all of
        2006–2007, and 5% or slightly less from September 2015 through
        January 2017 (the latest date for which data are available as of
        this writing). The previous time unemployment had been less than
        5% for three consecutive years was three

          

          

        decades earlier, from 1968 to 1970.

    3.  The unemployment rate never falls all the way to zero. It almost
        never seems to get below 3%—and it stays that low only for very
        short periods. (We discuss reasons why this is the case later in
        this chapter.)

    4.  <span id="bookmark632">The timing of rises and falls in
        unemployment matches fairly well with the timing of upswings and
        downswings in the overall economy, except that unemployment
        tends to lag changes in economic activity, and especially so
        during upswings of the economy following a recession. During
        periods of recession and depression, unemployment is high.
        During periods of economic growth, unemployment tends to be
        lower.</span><span id="bookmark633">‌</span>

    5.  No significant upward or downward trend in unemployment rates is
        apparent. This point is especially worth noting because the U.S.
        population more than quadrupled from 76 million in 1900 to over
        324 million by 2017. Moreover, a higher proportion of U.S.
        adults are now in the paid workforce, because women have entered
        the paid labor force in significant numbers in recent decades.
        Women comprised 18% of the paid workforce in 1900 and nearly
        half of the paid workforce in 2017. However, despite the
        increased number of workers, as well as other economic events
        like globalization and the continuous invention of new
        technologies, the economy has provided jobs without causing any
        long-term upward or downward trend in unemployment rates.

        Unemployment Rates by Group

        <a href="#bookmark634" class="s34">Unemployment is not distributed evenly across the U.S. population.</a>
        <a href="#bookmark634" class="a">Figure 8.4</a> <span

        Demographic Group</span> <span class="s37">(a) By gender,
        1972–2016. Unemployment rates for men used to be lower than
        unemployment rates for women, but in recent decades, the two
        rates have been very close, often– and especially during and
        soon after the Great Recession – with the unemployment rate for
        men somewhat higher. (b) By age, 1972–2016. Unemployment rates
        are highest for the very young and become lower with age. (c) By
        race and ethnicity, 1972–2016. Although unemployment rates for
        all groups tend to rise and fall together, the unemployment rate
        for blacks is typically about twice as high as that for whites,
        while the unemployment rate for Hispanics is in between.

        recession. It also provides some very useful information on the
        statistics of unemployment.</span>

        <a href="#bookmark634" class="s34">The unemployment rate for women had historically tended to be higher than the unemployment rate for men, perhaps reflecting the historical pattern that women were seen as “secondary” earners. By about 1980, however, the unemployment rate for women was essentially the same as that for men, as</a>
        <a href="#bookmark634" class="a">Figure 8.4</a> <span
        class="p">(a) shows. During the 2008-2009 recession and in the
        immediate aftermath, the unemployment rate for men exceeded the
        unemployment rate for women. Subsequently, however, the gap has
        narrowed.</span>

          

          

        <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_195.png" width="624" height="160" alt="image" />

          

        <a href="#bookmark634" class="s34">Younger workers tend to have higher unemployment, while middle-aged workers tend to have lower unemployment, probably because the middle-aged workers feel the responsibility of needing to have a job more heavily. Younger workers move in and out of jobs more than middle-aged workers, as part of the process of matching of workers and jobs, and this contributes to their higher unemployment rates. In addition, middle-aged workers are more likely to feel the responsibility of needing to have a job more heavily. Elderly workers have extremely low rates of unemployment, because those who do not have jobs often exit the labor force by retiring, and thus are not counted in the unemployment statistics.</a>
        <a href="#bookmark634" class="a">Figure 8.4</a> <span
        class="p">(b) shows unemployment rates for women divided by age.
        The pattern for men is similar.</span>

        <a href="#bookmark634" class="s34">The unemployment rate for African-Americans is substantially higher than the rate for other racial or ethnic groups, a fact that surely reflects, to some extent, a pattern of discrimination that has constrained blacks’ labor market opportunities. However, the gaps between unemployment rates for whites and for blacks and Hispanics diminished in the 1990s, as</a>
        <a href="#bookmark634" class="a">Figure</a> 8.4 <span
        class="p">(c) shows. In fact, unemployment rates for blacks and
        Hispanics were at the lowest levels for several decades in the
        mid-2000s before rising during the recent Great
        Recession.</span>

        Finally, those with less education typically suffer higher
        unemployment. In January 2017, for example, the unemployment
        rate for those with a college degree was 2.5%; for those with
        some college but not a four year degree, the unemployment rate
        was 3.8%; for high school graduates with no additional degree,
        the unemployment rate was 5.3%; and for those without a high
        school diploma, the unemployment rate was 7.7%. This pattern
        arises because additional education typically offers better
        connections to the labor market and higher demand. With less
        attractive labor market opportunities for low-skilled workers
        compared to the opportunities for the more highly- skilled,
        including lower pay, low-skilled workers may be less motivated
        to find jobs.

        unemployment rates with care, because each country has slightly
        different definitions of unemployment, survey tools for
        measuring unemployment, and also different labor markets. For
        example, Japan’s unemployment rates appear quite low, but
        Japan’s economy has been mired in slow growth and recession
        since the late 1980s, and Japan’s unemployment rate probably
        paints too rosy a picture of its

        <a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/ChinaEmployment" class="s84">We hear about the Chinese economy in the news all the time. The value of the Chinese yuan in comparison to the U.S. dollar is likely to be part of the nightly business report, so why is the Chinese economy not included in this discussion of international unemployment? The lack of reliable statistics is the reason. This</a>

        labor market. In Japan, workers who lose their jobs are often
        quick to exit the labor force and not look for a new job, in
        which case they are not counted as unemployed. In addition,
        Japanese firms are often quite reluctant to fire workers, and so
        firms have substantial numbers of workers who are on reduced
        hours or officially employed, but doing very little. We can view
        this Japanese pattern as an unusual method for society to
        provide support for the unemployed, rather than a sign of a
        healthy economy.

          

          

        <span id="bookmark638">Comparing unemployment rates in the
        United States and other high-income economies with unemployment
        rates in Latin America, Africa, Eastern Europe, and Asia is very
        difficult. One reason is that the statistical agencies in many
        poorer countries lack the resources and technical capabilities
        of the U.S. Bureau of the Census. However, a more difficult
        problem with international comparisons is that in many
        low-income countries, most workers are not involved in the labor
        market through an employer who pays them regularly. Instead,
        workers in these countries are engaged in short-term work,
        subsistence activities, and barter. Moreover, the effect of
        unemployment is very different in high-income and low-income
        countries. Unemployed workers in the developed economies have
        access to various government programs like unemployment
        insurance, welfare, and food stamps. Such programs may barely
        exist in poorer countries. Although unemployment is a serious
        problem in many low-income countries, it manifests itself in a
        different way than in high-income countries.</span>

            style=" color: #3767B1;">What Causes Changes in Unemployment
            over the Short Run</span><span id="bookmark639">‌</span>

            By the end of this section, you will be able to:

            -   Analyze cyclical unemployment

            -   Explain the relationship between sticky wages and
                employment using various economic arguments

            -   Apply supply and demand models to unemployment and wages

              

            We have seen that unemployment varies across times and
            places. What causes changes in unemployment? There are
            different answers in the short run and in the long run.
            Let's look at the short run first.

            Cyclical Unemployment

            Let’s make the plausible assumption that in the short run,
            from a few months to a few years, the quantity of hours that
            the average person is willing to work for a given wage does
            not change much, so the labor supply curve does not shift
            much. In addition, make the standard *ceteris paribus*
            assumption that there is no substantial short-term change in
            the age structure of the labor force, institutions and laws
            affecting the labor market, or other possibly relevant
            factors.

            <span id="bookmark640">One primary determinant of the demand
            for labor from firms is how they perceive the state of the
            macro economy. If firms believe that business is expanding,
            then at any given wage they will desire to hire a greater
            quantity of labor, and</span>

              

              

            <span id="bookmark641">the labor demand curve shifts to the
            right. Conversely, if firms perceive that the economy is
            slowing down or entering a recession, then they will wish to
            hire a lower quantity of labor at any given wage, and the
            labor demand curve will shift to the left. Economists call
            the variation in unemployment that the economy causes moving
            from expansion to recession or from recession to expansion
            (i.e. the business cycle)</span> **cyclical unemployment**.

            <a href="#bookmark643" id="bookmark642" class="s34">From the standpoint of the supply-and-demand model of competitive and flexible labor markets, unemployment represents something of a puzzle. In a supply-and-demand model of a labor market, as</a>
            <a href="#bookmark643" class="a">Figure 8.5</a> <span
            class="p">illustrates, the labor market should move toward
            an equilibrium wage and quantity. At the equilibrium wage
            (We), the equilibrium quantity (Qe) of labor supplied by
            workers should be equal to the quantity of labor demanded by
            employers.</span>

              

              

            <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_198.jpg" width="243" height="230" alt="image" />

            Equilibrium in the Labor Market</span> <span class="s37">In
            a labor market with flexible wages, the equilibrium will
            occur at wage We and quantity Qe, where the number of people
            who want jobs (shown by S) equals the number of jobs
            available (shown by D).</span>

              

            One possibility for unemployment is that people who are
            unemployed are those who are not willing to work at the
            current equilibrium wage, say $10 an hour, but would be
            willing to work at a higher wage, like $20 per hour. The
            monthly Current Population Survey would count these people
            as unemployed, because they say they are ready and looking
            for work (at $20 per hour). However, from an economist’s
            perspective, these people are choosing to be unemployed.

            <span id="bookmark644">Probably a few people are unemployed
            because of unrealistic expectations about wages, but they do
            not represent the majority of the unemployed. Instead,
            unemployed people often have friends or acquaintances of
            similar skill levels who are employed, and the unemployed
            would be willing to work at the jobs and wages similar to
            what those people are receiving. However, the employers of
            their friends and acquaintances do not seem to be hiring. In
            other words, these people are involuntarily unemployed. What
            causes involuntary unemployment?</span>

            Why Wages Might Be Sticky Downward

            If a labor market model with flexible wages does not
            describe unemployment very well—because it predicts that
            anyone willing to work at the going wage can always find a
            job—then it may prove useful to consider economic models in
            which wages are not flexible or adjust only very slowly. In
            particular, even though wage increases may occur with
            relative ease, wage decreases are few and far between.

            <span id="bookmark645">One set of reasons why wages may be
            “sticky downward,” as economists put it, involves economic
            laws and institutions. For low-skilled workers receiving
            minimum wage, it is illegal to reduce their wages. For union
            workers operating under a multiyear contract with a company,
            wage cuts might violate the contract and create a labor
            dispute or a strike. However, minimum wages and union
            contracts are not a sufficient reason why wages would be
            sticky downward for the U.S. economy as a whole. After all,
            out of the 150 million or so employed workers in the U.S.
            economy, only about 2.6 million—less than 2% of the total—do
            not receive compensation above the minimum wage. Similarly,
            labor unions represent only about 11% of American wage and
            salary workers. In other high-income countries, more workers
            may have their wages determined by unions or the minimum
            wage may be set at a level that applies to a larger share of
            workers. However, for the United States, these two factors
            combined affect only about 15% or less of the labor
            force.</span>

              

              

            <span id="bookmark646">Economists looking for reasons why
            wages might be sticky downwards have focused on factors that
            may characterize most labor relationships in the economy,
            not just a few. Many have proposed a number of different
            theories, but they share a common tone.</span>

            <span id="bookmark647">One argument is that even employees
            who are not union members often work under an</span>
            **implicit contract**, which is that the employer will try
            to keep wages from falling when the economy is weak or the
            business is having trouble, and the employee will not expect
            huge salary increases when the economy or the business is
            strong. This wage-setting behavior acts like a form of
            insurance: the employee has some protection against wage
            declines in bad times, but pays for that protection with
            lower wages in good times. Clearly, this sort of implicit
            contract means that firms will be hesitant to cut wages,
            lest workers feel betrayed and work less hard or even leave
            the firm.

            <span id="bookmark648">Efficiency wage theory</span> <span
            class="p">argues that workers' productivity depends on their
            pay, and so employers will often find it worthwhile to pay
            their employees somewhat more than market conditions might
            dictate. One reason is that employees who receive better pay
            than others will be more productive because they recognize
            that if they were to lose their current jobs, they would
            suffer a decline in salary. As a result, they are motivated
            to work harder and to stay with the current employer. In
            addition, employers know that it is costly and
            time-consuming to hire and train new employees, so they
            would prefer to pay workers a little extra now rather than
            to lose them and have to hire and train new workers. Thus,
            by avoiding wage cuts, the employer minimizes costs of
            training and hiring new workers, and reaps the benefits of
            well-motivated employees.</span>

            <span id="bookmark649">The</span> **adverse selection of
            wage cuts argument** points out that if an employer reacts
            to poor business conditions by reducing wages for all
            workers, then the best workers, those with the best
            employment alternatives at other firms, are the most likely
            to leave. The least attractive workers, with fewer
            employment alternatives, are more likely to stay.
            Consequently, firms are more likely to choose which workers
            should depart, through layoffs and firings, rather than
            trimming wages across the board. Sometimes companies that
            are experiencing difficult times can persuade workers to
            take a pay cut for the short term, and still retain most of
            the firm’s workers. However, it is far more typical for
            companies to lay off some workers, rather than to cut wages
            for everyone.

            <span id="bookmark650">The</span> **insider-outsider model**
            of the labor force, in simple terms, argues that those
            already working for firms are “insiders,” while new
            employees, at least for a time, are “outsiders.” A firm
            depends on its insiders to keep the organization running
            smoothly, to be familiar with routine procedures, and to
            train new employees. However, cutting wages will alienate
            the insiders and damage the firm’s productivity and
            prospects.

            <span id="bookmark651">Finally, the</span> **relative wage
            coordination argument** points out that even if most workers
            were hypothetically willing to see a decline in their own
            wages in bad economic times as long as everyone else also
            experiences such a decline, there is no obvious way for a
            decentralized economy to implement such a plan. Instead,
            workers confronted with the possibility of a wage cut will
            worry that other workers will not have such a wage cut, and
            so a wage cut means being worse off both in absolute terms
            and relative to others. As a result, workers fight hard
            against wage cuts.

            <a href="#bookmark652" class="s34">These theories of why wages tend not to move downward differ in their logic and their implications, and figuring out the strengths and weaknesses of each theory is an ongoing subject of research and controversy among economists. All tend to imply that wages will decline only very slowly, if at all, even when the economy or a business is having tough times. When wages are inflexible and unlikely to fall, then either short-run or long-run unemployment can result.</a>

            This analysis helps to explain the connection that we noted

            wages that are sticky downwards, unemployment changes. The
            rise in unemployment that occurs because of a recession is
            cyclical unemployment.

            By the end of this section, you will be able to:

            -   Explain frictional and structural unemployment

            -   Assess relationships between the natural rate of
                employment and potential real GDP, productivity, and
                public policy

            -   Identify recent patterns in the natural rate of
                employment

            -   Propose ways to combat unemployment

              

            <span id="bookmark655">Cyclical unemployment explains why
            unemployment rises during a recession and falls during an
            economic expansion, but what explains the remaining level of
            unemployment even in good economic times? Why is the
            unemployment rate never zero? Even when the U.S. economy is
            growing strongly, the unemployment rate only rarely dips as
            low as 4%. Moreover, the discussion earlier in this chapter
            pointed out that unemployment rates in many European
            countries like Italy, France, and Germany have often been
            remarkably high at various times in the last few decades.
            Why does some level of unemployment persist even when
            economies are growing strongly? Why are unemployment rates
            continually higher in certain economies, through good
            economic years and bad? Economists have a term to describe
            the remaining level of unemployment that occurs even when
            the economy is healthy: they call it the</span> **natural
            rate of unemployment**.

            The Long Run: The Natural Rate of Unemployment

            The natural rate of unemployment is not “natural” in the
            sense that water freezes at 32 degrees Fahrenheit or boils
            at 212 degrees Fahrenheit. It is not a physical and
            unchanging law of nature. Instead, it is only the “natural”
            rate because it is the unemployment rate that would result
            from the combination of economic, social, and political
            factors that exist at a time—assuming the economy was
            neither booming nor in recession. These forces include the
            usual pattern of companies expanding and contracting their
            workforces in a dynamic economy, social and economic forces
            that affect the labor market, or public policies that affect
            either the eagerness of people to work or the willingness of
            businesses to hire. Let’s discuss these factors in more
            detail.

              

            Frictional Unemployment

            <span id="bookmark656">In a market economy, some companies
            are always going broke for a variety of reasons: old
            technology; poor management; good management that happened
            to make bad decisions; shifts in tastes of consumers so that
            less of the firm’s product is desired; a large customer who
            went broke; or tough domestic or foreign competitors.
            Conversely, other companies will be doing very well for just
            the opposite reasons and looking to hire more employees. In
            a perfect world, all of those who lost jobs would
            immediately find new ones. However, in the real world, even
            if the number of job seekers is equal to the number of job
            vacancies, it takes time to find out about new jobs, to
            interview and figure out if the new job is a good match, or
            perhaps to sell a house and buy another in proximity to a
            new job. Economists call the unemployment that occurs in the
            meantime, as workers move between jobs,</span> **frictional
            unemployment**. Frictional unemployment is not inherently a
            bad thing. It takes time on part of both the employer and
            the individual to match those looking for employment with
            the correct job openings. For individuals and companies to
            be successful and productive, you want people to find the
            job for which they are best suited, not just the first job
            offered.<span id="bookmark657">‌</span>

            In the mid-2000s, before the 2008–2009 recession, it was
            true that about 7% of U.S. workers saw their jobs disappear
            in any three-month period. However, in periods of economic
            growth, these destroyed jobs are counterbalanced for the
            economy as a whole by a larger number of jobs created. In
            2005, for example, there were typically about 7.5 million
            unemployed people at any given time in the U.S. economy.
            Even though about two-thirds of those unemployed people
            found a job in 14 weeks or fewer, the unemployment rate did
            not change much during the year, because those who found new
            jobs were largely offset by others who lost jobs.

            Of course, it would be preferable if people who were losing
            jobs could immediately and easily move into newly created
            jobs, but in the real world, that is not possible. Someone
            who is laid off by a textile mill in South Carolina cannot
            turn around and immediately start working for a textile mill
            in California. Instead, the adjustment process happens in
            ripples. Some people find new jobs near their old ones,
            while others find that they must move to new locations. Some
            people can do a very similar job with a different company,
            while others must start new career paths. Some people may be
            near retirement and decide to look only for part-time work,
            while others want an employer that offers a long-term career
            path. The frictional unemployment that results from people
            moving between jobs in a dynamic economy may account for one
            to two percentage points of total unemployment.

            The level of frictional unemployment will depend on how easy
            it is for workers to learn about alternative jobs, which may
            reflect the ease of communications about job prospects in
            the economy. The extent of frictional unemployment will also
            depend to some extent on how willing people are to move to
            new areas to find jobs—which in turn may depend on history
            and culture.

            <a href="#bookmark634" class="s34">Frictional unemployment and the natural rate of unemployment also seem to depend on the age distribution of the population.</a>
            <a href="#bookmark634" class="a">Figure 8.4</a> <span
            class="p">(b) showed that unemployment rates are typically
            lower for people between 25–54 years of age or aged 55 and
            over than they are for those who are younger. “Prime-age
            workers,” as those in the 25–54 age bracket are sometimes
            called, are typically at a place in their lives when they
            want to have a job and income arriving at all times. In
            addition, older workers who lose jobs may prefer to opt for
            retirement. By contrast, it is likely that a relatively high
            proportion of those who are under 25 will be trying out jobs
            and life options, and this leads to greater job mobility and
            hence higher frictional unemployment. Thus, a society with a
            relatively high proportion of young workers, like the U.S.
            beginning in the mid-1960s when Baby Boomers began entering
            the labor market, will tend to have a higher unemployment
            rate than a society with a higher proportion of its workers
            in older ages.</span>

            Structural Unemployment

            <span id="bookmark658">Another factor that influences the
            natural rate of unemployment is the amount of</span>
            **structural unemployment**. The structurally unemployed are
            individuals who have no jobs because they lack skills valued
            by the labor market, either because demand has shifted away
            from the skills they do have, or because they never learned
            any skills. An example of the former would be the
            unemployment among aerospace engineers after the U.S. space
            program downsized in the 1970s. An example of the latter
            would be high school dropouts.

            Some people worry that technology causes structural
            unemployment. In the past, new technologies have put lower
            skilled employees out of work, but at the same time they
            create demand for higher skilled workers to use the new
            technologies. Education seems to be the key in minimizing
            the amount of structural unemployment. Individuals who have
            degrees can be retrained if they become structurally
            unemployed. For people with no skills and little education,
            that option is more limited.

              

            Natural Unemployment and Potential Real GDP

            The natural unemployment rate is related to two other
            important concepts: full employment and potential real GDP.
            Economists consider the economy to be at full employment
            when the actual unemployment rate is equal to the natural
            unemployment rate. When the economy is at full employment,
            real GDP is equal to potential real GDP. By contrast, when
            the economy is below full employment, the unemployment rate
            is greater than the natural unemployment rate and real GDP
            is less than potential. Finally, when the economy is above
            full employment, then the unemployment rate is less than the
            natural unemployment rate and real GDP is greater than
            potential. Operating above potential is only possible for a
            short while, since it is analogous to all workers working
            overtime.

            Productivity Shifts and the Natural Rate of Unemployment

            Unexpected shifts in productivity can have a powerful effect
            on the natural rate of unemployment. Over time, workers'
            productivity determines the level of wages in an economy.
            After all, if a business paid workers more than could be
            justified by their productivity, the business will
            ultimately lose money and go bankrupt. Conversely, if a
            business tries to pay workers less than their productivity
            then, in a competitive labor market, other businesses will
            find it worthwhile to hire away those workers and pay them
            more.

            <span id="bookmark659">However, adjustments of wages to
            productivity levels will not happen quickly or smoothly.
            Employers typically review wages only once or twice a year.
            In many modern jobs, it is difficult to measure productivity
            at the individual level. For example, how precisely would
            one measure the quantity produced by an accountant who is
            one of many people working in the tax department of a large
            corporation? Because productivity is difficult to observe,
            employers often determine wage increases based on recent
            experience with productivity. If productivity has been
            rising at, say, 2% per year, then wages rise at that level
            as well. However, when productivity changes unexpectedly, it
            can affect the natural rate of unemployment for a
            time.</span>

            <a href="#bookmark537" class="s34">The U.S. economy in the 1970s and 1990s provides two vivid examples of this process. In the 1970s, productivity growth slowed down unexpectedly (as we discussed in</a>
            <a href="#bookmark537" class="a">Economic</a> <span
            class="s54">Growth</span><a href="#bookmark660" class="s34">). For example, output per hour of U.S. workers in the business sector increased at an annual rate of 3.3% per year from 1960 to 1973, but only 0.8% from 1973 to 1982.</a>
            <a href="#bookmark660" class="a">Figure</a> <span
            class="s54">8.8 </span>(a) illustrates the situation where
            the demand for labor—that is, the quantity of labor that
            business is willing to hire at any given wage—has been
            shifting out a little each year because of rising
            productivity, from D<span class="s60">0</span> to D<span
            class="s60">1</span> to D<span class="s60">2</span>. As a
            result, equilibrium wages have been rising each year from
            W<span class="s60">0</span> to W<span class="s60">1</span>
            to W<span class="s60">2</span>. However, when productivity
            unexpectedly slows down, the pattern of wage increases does
            not adjust right away. Wages keep rising each year from
            W<span class="s60">2</span> to W<span class="s60">3</span>
            to W<span class="s60">4</span>, but the demand for labor is
            no longer shifting up. A gap opens where the quantity of
            labor supplied at wage level W<span class="s60">4</span> is
            greater than the quantity demanded. The natural rate of
            unemployment rises. In the aftermath of this unexpectedly
            low productivity in the 1970s, the national unemployment
            rate did not fall below 7% from May, 1980 until 1986. Over
            time, the rise in wages will adjust to match the slower
            gains in productivity, and the unemployment rate will ease
            back down, but this process may take years.

            <span id="bookmark660"><span class="s36">Figure 8.8
            Unexpected Productivity Changes and Unemployment
            </span></span>(a) Productivity is rising, increasing the
            demand for labor. Employers and workers become used to the
            pattern of wage increases. Then productivity suddenly stops
            increasing. However, the expectations of employers and
            workers for wage increases do not shift immediately, so
            wages keep rising as before. However, the demand for labor
            has not increased, so at wage W<span class="s63">4</span>,
            unemployment exists where the quantity supplied of labor
            exceeds the quantity demanded. (b) The rate of productivity
            increase has been zero for a time, so employers and workers
            have come to accept the equilibrium wage level (W). Then
            productivity increases unexpectedly, shifting demand for
            labor from D<span class="s63">0</span> to D<span
            class="s63">1</span>. At the wage (W), this means that the
            quantity demanded of labor exceeds the quantity supplied,
            and with job offers plentiful, the unemployment rate will be
            low.

              

            <a href="#bookmark660" class="s34">The late 1990s provide an opposite example: instead of the surprise decline in productivity that occurred in the 1970s, productivity unexpectedly rose in the mid-1990s. The annual growth rate of real output per hour of labor increased from 1.7% from 1980–1995, to an annual rate of 2.6% from 1995–2001. Let’s simplify the situation a bit, so that the economic lesson of the story is easier to see graphically, and say that productivity had not been increasing at all in earlier years, so the intersection of the labor market was at point E in</a>
            <a href="#bookmark660" class="a">Figure 8.8</a><span
            class="s54"> </span>(b), where the demand curve for labor
            (D<span class="s60">0</span>) intersects the supply curve
            for labor. As a result, real wages were not increasing. Now,
            productivity jumps upward, which shifts the demand for labor
            out to the right, from D<span class="s60">0</span> to D<span
            class="s60">1</span>. At least for a time, however, wages
            are still set according to the earlier expectations of no
            productivity growth, so wages do not rise. The result is
            that at the prevailing wage level (W), the quantity of labor
            demanded (Qd) will for a time exceed the quantity of labor
            supplied (Qs), and unemployment will be very low—actually
            below the natural level of unemployment for a time. This
            pattern of unexpectedly high productivity helps to explain
            why the unemployment rate stayed below 4.5%—quite a low
            level by historical standards—from 1998 until after the U.S.
            economy had entered a recession in 2001.

            Levels of unemployment will tend to be somewhat higher on
            average when productivity is unexpectedly low, and
            conversely, will tend to be somewhat lower on average when
            productivity is unexpectedly high. However, over time, wages
            do eventually adjust to reflect productivity levels.

            Public Policy and the Natural Rate of Unemployment

            Public policy can also have a powerful effect on the natural
            rate of unemployment. On the supply side of the labor
            market, public policies to assist the unemployed can affect
            how eager people are to find work. For example, if a worker
            who loses a job is guaranteed a generous package of
            unemployment insurance, welfare benefits, food stamps, and
            government medical benefits, then the opportunity cost of
            unemployment is lower and that worker will be less eager to
            seek a new job.

            What seems to matter most is not just the amount of these
            benefits, but how long they last. A society that provides
            generous help for the unemployed that cuts off after, say,
            six months, may provide less of an incentive for
            unemployment than a society that provides less generous help
            that lasts for several years. Conversely, government
            assistance for job search or retraining can in some cases
            encourage people back to work sooner. See the Clear it Up to
            learn how the U.S. handles unemployment insurance.

              

            <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_203.png" width="624" height="740" alt="image" />

            How does U.S. unemployment insurance work?

            Unemployment insurance is a joint federal–state program that
            the federal government enacted in 1935. While the federal
            government sets minimum standards for the program, state
            governments conduct most of the administration.

            The funding for the program is a federal tax collected from
            employers. The federal government requires tax collection on
            the first $7,000 in wages paid to each worker; however,
            states can choose to collect the tax on a higher amount if
            they wish, and 41 states have set a higher limit. States can
            choose the length of time that they pay benefits, although
            most states limit unemployment benefits to 26 weeks—with
            extensions possible in times of especially high
            unemployment. The states then use the fund to pay benefits
            to those who become unemployed. Average unemployment
            benefits are equal to about one-third of the wage that the
            person earned in his or her previous job, but the level of
            unemployment benefits varies considerably across states.

            One other interesting thing to note about the
            classifications of unemployment—an individual does not have
            to collect unemployment benefits to be classified as
            unemployed. While there are statistics kept and studied
            relating to how many people are collecting unemployment
            insurance, this is not the source of unemployment rate
            information.

            On the demand side of the labor market, government rules,
            social institutions, and the presence of unions can affect
            the willingness of firms to hire. For example, if a
            government makes it hard for businesses to start up or to
            expand, by wrapping new businesses in bureaucratic red tape,
            then businesses will become more discouraged about hiring.
            Government regulations can make it harder to start a
            business by requiring that a new business obtain many
            permits and pay many fees, or by restricting the types and
            quality of products that a company can sell. Other
            government regulations, like zoning laws, may limit where
            companies can conduct business, or whether businesses are
            allowed to be open during evenings or on Sunday.

            Whatever defenses may be offered for such laws in terms of
            social value—like the value some Christians place on not
            working on Sunday, or Orthodox Jews or highly observant
            Muslims on Saturday—these kinds of restrictions impose a
            barrier between some willing workers and other willing
            employers, and thus contribute to a higher natural rate of
            unemployment. Similarly, if government makes it difficult to
            fire or lay off workers, businesses may react by trying not
            to hire more workers than strictly necessary—since laying
            these workers off would be costly and difficult. High
            minimum wages may discourage businesses from hiring
            low-skill workers. Government rules may encourage and
            support powerful unions, which can then push up wages for
            union workers, but at a cost of discouraging businesses from
            hiring those workers.

            The Natural Rate of Unemployment in Recent Years

            The underlying economic, social, and political factors that
            determine the natural rate of unemployment can change over
            time, which means that the natural rate of unemployment can
            change over time, too.

            Estimates by economists of the natural rate of unemployment
            in the U.S. economy in the early 2000s run at about 4.5 to
            5.5%. This is a lower estimate than earlier. We outline
            three of the common reasons that economists propose for this
            change below.

            1.  The internet has provided a remarkable new tool through
                which job seekers can find out about jobs at different
                companies and can make contact with relative ease. An
                internet search is far easier than trying to find a list
                of local employers and then hunting up phone numbers for
                all of their human resources departments, and requesting
                a list of jobs and application forms. Social networking
                sites such as LinkedIn have changed how people find work
                as well.

            2.  The growth of the temporary worker industry has probably
                helped to reduce the natural rate of unemployment. In
                the early 1980s, only about 0.5% of all workers held
                jobs through temp agencies. By the early 2000s, the
                figure had risen above 2%. Temp agencies can provide
                jobs for workers while they are looking for permanent
                work. They can also serve as a clearinghouse, helping
                workers find out about jobs with certain employers and
                getting a tryout with the employer. For many workers, a
                temp job is a stepping-stone to a permanent job that
                they might not have heard about or obtained any other
                way, so the growth of temp jobs will also tend to reduce
                frictional unemployment.

            3.  The aging of the “baby boom generation”—the especially
                large generation of Americans born between 1946 and
                1964—meant that the proportion of young workers in the
                economy was relatively high in the 1970s, as the boomers
                entered the labor market, but is relatively low today.
                As we noted earlier, middle-aged and older workers are
                far more likely to experience low unemployment than
                younger workers, a factor that tends to reduce the
                natural rate of unemployment as the baby boomers age.

    The combined result of these factors is that the natural rate of
    unemployment was on average lower in the 1990s and the early 2000s
    than in the 1980s. The 2008–2009 Great Recession pushed monthly
    unemployment rates up to 10% in late 2009. However, even at that
    time, the Congressional Budget Office was forecasting that by 2015,
    unemployment

      

      

    rates would fall back to about 5%. During the last four months of
    2015 the unemployment rate held steady at 5.0%. Throughout 2016 and
    up through January 2017, the unemployment rate has remained at or
    slightly below 5%. As of the first quarter of 2017, the
    Congressional Budget Office estimates the natural rate to be 4.74%,
    and the measured unemployment rate for January 2017 is 4.8%.

    The Natural Rate of Unemployment in Europe

    By the standards of other high-income economies, the natural rate of
    unemployment in the U.S. economy appears relatively low. Through
    good economic years and bad, many European economies have had
    unemployment rates hovering near 10%, or even higher, since the
    1970s. European rates of unemployment have been higher not because
    recessions in Europe have been deeper, but rather because the
    conditions underlying supply and demand for labor have been
    different in Europe, in a way that has created a much higher natural
    rate of unemployment.

    Many European countries have a combination of generous welfare and
    unemployment benefits, together with nests of rules that impose
    additional costs on businesses when they hire. In addition, many
    countries have laws that require firms to give workers months of
    notice before laying them off and to provide substantial severance
    or retraining packages after laying them off. The legally required
    notice before laying off a worker can be more than three months in
    Spain, Germany, Denmark, and Belgium, and the legally required
    severance package can be as high as a year’s salary or more in
    Austria, Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Greece. Such laws will surely
    discourage laying off or firing current workers. However, when
    companies know that it will be difficult to fire or lay off workers,
    they also become hesitant about hiring in the first place.

    We can attribute the typically higher levels of unemployment in many
    European countries in recent years, which have prevailed even when
    economies are growing at a solid pace, to the fact that the sorts of
    laws and regulations that lead to a high natural rate of
    unemployment are much more prevalent in Europe than in the United
    States.

    A Preview of Policies to Fight Unemployment

    <a href="#bookmark1384" class="a">Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1530" class="s34">and</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1530" class="a">Macroeconomic Policy Around the World</a>
    <span class="p">chapters provide a detailed discussion of how to
    fight unemployment, when we can discuss these policies in the
    context of the full array of macroeconomic goals and frameworks for
    analysis. However, even at this preliminary stage, it is useful to
    preview the main issues concerning policies to fight
    unemployment.</span>

    <a href="#bookmark1384" class="s34">The remedy for unemployment will depend on the diagnosis. Cyclical unemployment is a short-term problem, caused because the economy is in a recession. Thus, the preferred solution will be to avoid or minimize recessions. As</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1384" class="a">Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy</a>
    <span class="p">discusses, governments can enact this policy by
    stimulating the overall buying power in the economy, so that firms
    perceive that sales and profits are possible, which makes them eager
    to hire.</span>

    Dealing with the natural rate of unemployment is trickier. In a
    market-oriented economy, firms will hire and fire workers.
    Governments cannot control this. Furthermore, the evolving age
    structure of the economy's population, or unexpected shifts in
    productivity are beyond a government's control and, will affect the
    natural rate of unemployment for a time. However, as the example of
    high ongoing unemployment rates for many European countries
    illustrates, government policy clearly can affect the natural rate
    of unemployment that will persist even when GDP is growing.

    When a government enacts policies that will affect workers or
    employers, it must examine how these policies will affect the
    information and incentives employees and employers have to find one
    another. For example, the government may have a role to play in
    helping some of the unemployed with job searches. Governments may
    need to rethink the design of their programs that offer assistance
    to unemployed workers and protections to employed workers so that
    they will not unduly discourage the supply of labor. Similarly,
    governments may need to reassess rules that make it difficult for
    businesses to begin or to expand so that they will not unduly
    discourage the demand for labor. The message is not that governments
    should repeal all laws affecting labor markets, but only that when
    they enact such laws, a society that cares about unemployment will
    need to consider the tradeoffs involved.

    Unemployment and the Great Recession

    In the review of unemployment during and after the Great Recession
    at the outset of this chapter, we noted that unemployment tends to
    be a lagging indicator of business activity. This has historically
    been the case, and it is evident for all recessions that have taken
    place since the end of World War II. In brief, this results from the
    costs to employers of recruitment, hiring, and training workers.
    Those costs represent investments by firms in their work forces.

    At the outset of a recession, when a firm realizes that demand for
    its product or service is not as strong as anticipated, it has an
    incentive to lay off workers. However, doing so runs the risk of
    losing those workers, and if the weak demand proves to be only
    temporary, the firm will be obliged to recruit, hire, and train new
    workers. Thus, firms tend to retain workers initially in a downturn.
    Similarly, as business begins to pick up when a recession is over,
    firms are not sure if the improvement will last. Rather than incur
    the costs of hiring and training new workers, they will wait, and
    perhaps resort to overtime work for existing workers, until they are
    confident that the recession is over.

    Another point that we noted at the outset is that the duration of
    recoveries in employment following recessions has been longer
    following the last three recessions (going back to the early 1990s)
    than previously. Nir Jaimovich and Henry Siu have argued that these
    “jobless recoveries” are a consequence of job polarization

    – the disappearance of employment opportunities focused on “routine”
    tasks. Job polarization refers to the increasing concentration of
    employment in the highest- and lowest-wage occupations, as jobs in
    middle-skill occupations disappear. Job polarization is an outcome
    of technological progress in robotics, computing, and information
    and communication technology. The result of this progress is a
    decline in demand for labor in occupations that perform “routine”
    tasks – tasks that are limited in scope and can be performed by
    following a well-defined set of procedures – and hence a decline in
    the share of total employment that is composed of routine
    occupations. Jaimovich and Siu have shown that job polarization
    characterizes the aftermath of the last three recessions, and this
    appears to be responsible for the jobless recoveries.

    KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY

      

    1.  <a href="#bookmark621" class="a">How Economists Define and Compute Unemployment</a>
        [Rate](#bookmark621)

        Unemployment imposes high costs. Unemployed individuals suffer
        from loss of income and from stress. An economy with high
        unemployment suffers an opportunity cost of unused resources. We
        can divide the adult population into those in the labor force
        and those out of the labor force. In turn, we divide those in
        the labor force into employed and unemployed. A person without a
        job must be willing and able to work and actively looking for
        work to be counted as unemployed; otherwise, a person without a
        job is counted as out of the labor force. Economists define the
        unemployment rate as the number of unemployed persons divided by
        the number of persons in the labor force (not the overall adult
        population). The Current Population Survey (CPS) conducted by
        the United States Census Bureau measures the percentage of the
        labor force that is unemployed. The establishment payroll survey
        by the Bureau of Labor Statistics measures the net change in
        jobs created for the month.

          

    2.  <a href="#bookmark629" class="a">Patterns of</a>
        [Unemployment](#bookmark629)

        The U.S. unemployment rate rises during periods of recession and
        depression, but falls back to the range of 4% to

          

          

        6% when the economy is strong. The unemployment rate never falls
        to zero. Despite enormous growth in the size of the U.S.
        population and labor force in the twentieth century, along with
        other major trends like globalization and new technology, the
        unemployment rate shows no long-term rising trend.

        Unemployment rates differ by group: higher for African-Americans
        and Hispanics than for whites; higher for less educated than
        more educated; higher for the young than the middle-aged.
        Women’s unemployment rates used to be higher than men’s, but in
        recent years men’s and women’s unemployment rates have been very
        similar. In recent years, unemployment rates in the United
        States have compared favorably with unemployment rates in most
        other high-income economies.

          

    3.  <a href="#bookmark639" class="a">What Causes Changes in Unemployment over the Short</a>
        [Run](#bookmark639)

        Cyclical unemployment rises and falls with the business cycle.
        In a labor market with flexible wages, wages will adjust in such
        a market so that quantity demanded of labor always equals the
        quantity supplied of labor at the equilibrium wage. Economists
        have proposed many theories for why wages might not be flexible,
        but instead may adjust only in a “sticky” way, especially when
        it comes to downward adjustments: implicit contracts, efficiency
        wage theory, adverse selection of wage cuts, insider-outsider
        model, and relative wage coordination.

          

    4.  <a href="#bookmark654" class="a">What Causes Changes in Unemployment over the Long</a>
        [Run](#bookmark654)

The natural rate of unemployment is the rate of unemployment that the
economic, social, and political forces in the economy would cause even
when the economy is not in a recession. These factors include the
frictional unemployment that occurs when people either choose to change
jobs or are put out of work for a time by the shifts of a dynamic and
changing economy. They also include any laws concerning conditions of
hiring and firing that have the undesired side effect of discouraging
job formation. They also include structural unemployment, which occurs
when demand shifts permanently away from a certain type of job skill.

  

SELF-CHECK QUESTIONS

1.  <span id="bookmark675">Suppose the adult population over the age of
    16 is 237.8 million and the labor force is 153.9 million (of
    whom</span>

    139.1 million are employed). How many people are “not in the labor
    force?” What are the proportions of employed, unemployed and not in
    the labor force in the population? *Hint*: Proportions are
    percentages.

2.  <span id="bookmark676">Using the above data, what is the
    unemployment rate? These data are U.S. statistics from 2010. How
    does it compare to the February 2015 unemployment rate computed
    earlier?</span>

3.  <span id="bookmark677">Over the long term, has the U.S. unemployment
    rate generally trended up, trended down, or remained at basically
    the same level?</span>

    3.  College graduates or high school graduates?

5.  <span id="bookmark679">Beginning in the 1970s and continuing for
    three decades, women entered the U.S. labor force in a big way. If
    we assume that wages are sticky in a downward direction, but that
    around 1970 the demand for labor equaled the supply of labor at the
    current wage rate, what do you imagine happened to the wage rate,
    employment, and unemployment as a result of increased labor force
    participation?</span>

6.  <span id="bookmark680">Is the increase in labor force participation
    rates among women better thought of as causing an increase in
    cyclical unemployment or an increase in the natural rate of
    unemployment? Why?</span>

        CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS

          

30. Using the definition of the unemployment rate, is an increase in the
    unemployment rate necessarily a bad thing for a nation?

31. Is a decrease in the unemployment rate necessarily a good thing for
    a nation? Explain.

32. If many workers become discouraged from looking for jobs, explain
    how the number of jobs could decline but the unemployment rate could
    fall at the same time.

33. Would you expect hidden unemployment to be higher, lower, or about
    the same when the unemployment rate is high, say 10%, versus low,
    say 4%? Explain.

34. Is the higher unemployment rates for minority workers necessarily an
    indication of discrimination? What could be some other reasons for
    the higher unemployment rate?

35. While unemployment is highly negatively correlated with the level of
    economic activity, in the real world it responds with a lag. In
    other words, firms do not immediately lay off workers in response to
    a sales decline. They wait a while before responding. Similarly,
    firms do not immediately hire workers when sales pick up. What do
    you think accounts for the lag in response time?

36. Why do you think that unemployment rates are lower for individuals
    with more education?

37. Do you think it is rational for workers to prefer sticky wages to
    wage cuts, when the consequence of sticky wages is unemployment for
    some workers? Why or why not? How do the reasons for sticky wages
    explained in this section apply to your argument?

38. Under what condition would a decrease in unemployment be bad for the
    economy?

39. Under what condition would an increase in the unemployment rate be a
    positive sign?

40. As the baby boom generation retires, the ratio of retirees to
    workers will increase noticeably. How will this affect the Social
    Security program? How will this affect the standard of living of the
    average American?

41. Unemployment rates have been higher in many European countries in
    recent decades than in the United States. Is the main reason for
    this long-term difference in unemployment rates more likely to be
    cyclical unemployment or the natural rate of unemployment? Explain
    briefly.

42. Is it desirable to pursue a goal of zero unemployment? Why or why
    not?

43. Is it desirable to eliminate natural unemployment? Why or why not?
    *Hint*: Think about what our economy would look like today and what
    assumptions would have to be met to have a zero rate of natural
    unemployment.

44. The U.S. unemployment rate increased from 4.6% in July 2001 to 5.9%
    by June 2002. Without studying the subject in any detail, would you
    expect that a change of this kind is more likely to be due to
    cyclical unemployment or a change in the natural rate of
    unemployment? Why?

      

    PROBLEMS

45. A country with a population of eight million adults has five million
    employed, 500,000 unemployed, and the rest of the adult population
    is out of the labor force. What’s the unemployment rate? What share
    of population is in the labor force? Sketch a pie chart that divides
    the adult population into these three groups.

      

46. A government passes a family-friendly law that no companies can have
    evening, nighttime, or weekend hours, so that everyone can be home
    with their families during these times. Analyze the effect of this
    law using a demand and supply diagram for the labor market: first
    assuming that wages are flexible, and then assuming that wages are
    sticky downward.

47. As the baby boomer generation retires, what should happen to wages
    and employment? Can you show this graphically?

A $550 Million Loaf of Bread?

If you were born within the last three decades in the United States,
Canada, or many other countries in the developed world, you probably
have no real experience with a high rate of inflation. Inflation is when
most prices in an entire economy are rising. However, there is an
extreme form of inflation called hyperinflation. This occurred in
Germany between 1921 and 1928, and more recently in Zimbabwe between
2008 and 2009. In November 2008, Zimbabwe had an inflation rate of 79.6
billion percent. In contrast, in 2014, the United States had an average
annual rate of inflation of 1.6%.

Zimbabwe’s inflation rate was so high it is difficult to comprehend, so
let’s put it into context. It is equivalent to price increases of 98%
per day. This means that, from one day to the next, prices essentially
double. What is life like in an economy afflicted with hyperinflation?
Most of you reading this will have never experienced this phenomenon.
The government adjusted prices for commodities in Zimbabwean dollars
several times *each day*. There was no desire to hold on to currency
since it lost value by the minute. The people there spent a great deal
of time getting rid of any cash they acquired by purchasing whatever
food or other commodities they could find. At one point, a loaf of bread
cost 550 million Zimbabwean dollars. Teachers' salaries were in the
trillions a month; however, this was equivalent to only one U.S. dollar
a day. At its height, it took 621,984,228 Zimbabwean dollars to purchase
one U.S. dollar.

Government agencies had no money to pay their workers so they started
printing money to pay their bills rather than raising taxes. Rising
prices caused the government to enact price controls on private
businesses, which led to shortages and the emergence of black markets.
In 2009, the country abandoned its currency and allowed people to use
foreign currencies for purchases.

  

How does this happen? How can both government and the economy fail to
function at the most basic level? Before we consider these extreme cases
of hyperinflation, let’s first look at inflation itself.

  

#### Introduction to Inflation

In this chapter, you will learn about:

-   Tracking Inflation

-   How to Measure Changes in the Cost of Living

-   How the U.S. and Other Countries Experience Inflation

-   The Confusion Over Inflation

-   Indexing and Its Limitations

  

<span id="bookmark691">Inflation</span> <span class="p">is a general and
ongoing rise in the level of prices in an entire economy. Inflation does
not refer to a change in relative prices. A relative price change occurs
when you see that the price of tuition has risen, but the price of
laptops has fallen. Inflation, on the other hand, means that there is
pressure for prices to rise in most markets in the economy. In addition,
price increases in the supply-and-demand model were one-time events,
representing a shift from a previous equilibrium to a new one. Inflation
implies an ongoing rise in prices. If inflation happened for one year
and then stopped, then it would not be inflation any more.</span>

This chapter begins by showing how to combine prices of individual goods
and services to create a measure of overall inflation. It discusses the
historical and recent experience of inflation, both in the United States
and in other countries around the world. Other chapters have sometimes
included a note under an exhibit or a parenthetical reminder in the text
saying that the numbers have been adjusted for inflation. In this
chapter, it is time to show how to use inflation statistics to adjust
other economic variables, so that you can tell how much of, for example,
we can attribute the rise in GDP over different periods of time to an
actual increase in the production of goods and services and how much we
should attribute to the fact that prices for most items have risen.

Inflation has consequences for people and firms throughout the economy,
in their roles as lenders and borrowers, wage-earners, taxpayers, and
consumers. The chapter concludes with a discussion of some imperfections
and biases in the inflation statistics, and a preview of policies for
fighting inflation that we will discuss in other chapters.

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Calculate the annual rate of inflation

    -   Explain and use index numbers and base years when simplifying
        the total quantity spent over a year for products

    -   Calculate inflation rates using index numbers

      

    <a href="#bookmark693" class="s34">Dinner table conversations where you might have heard about inflation usually entail reminiscing about when “everything seemed to cost so much less. You used to be able to buy three gallons of gasoline for a dollar and then go see an afternoon movie for another dollar.”</a>
    <a href="#bookmark693" class="a">Table 9.1</a>
    <a href="#bookmark693" class="s34">compares some prices of common goods in 1970 and 2017. Of course, the average prices in this table may not reflect the prices where you live. The cost of living in New York City is much higher than in Houston, Texas, for example. In addition, certain products have evolved over recent decades. A new car in 2017, loaded with antipollution equipment, safety gear, computerized engine controls, and many other technological advances, is a more advanced machine (and more fuel efficient) than your typical 1970s car. However, put details like these to one side for the moment, and look at the overall pattern. The primary reason behind the price rises in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark693" class="a">Table</a> 9.1<span class="p">—and
    all the price increases for the other products in the economy—is not
    specific to the market for housing or cars or gasoline or movie
    tickets. Instead, it is part of a general rise in the level of all
    prices. At the beginning of 2017, $1 had about the same purchasing
    power in overall terms of goods and services as 18 cents did
    in</span>

      

      

    1972, because of the amount of inflation that has occurred over that
    time period.

    <a href="#bookmark693" id="bookmark694" class="s34">Moreover, the power of inflation does not affect just goods and services, but wages and income levels, too. The second-to-last row of</a>
    <a href="#bookmark693" class="a">Table 9.1</a> <span class="p">shows
    that the average hourly wage for a manufacturing worker increased

    better educated and more productive than the average worker in
    1970—but not six times more productive. Per capita GDP increased
    substantially from 1970 to 2017, but is the average person in the

    years? Not likely.</span><span id="bookmark695">‌</span>

    A modern economy has millions of goods and services whose prices are
    continually quivering in the breezes of supply and demand. How can
    all of these shifts in price attribute to a single inflation rate?
    As with many problems in economic measurement, the conceptual answer
    is reasonably straightforward: Economists combine prices of a
    variety of goods and services into a single price level. The
    inflation rate is simply the percentage change in the price level.
    Applying the concept, however, involves some practical difficulties.

    The Price of a Basket of Goods

    <span id="bookmark696">To calculate the price level, economists
    begin with the concept of a</span> **basket of goods and services**,
    consisting of the different items individuals, businesses, or
    organizations typically buy. The next step is to look at how the
    prices of those items change over time. In thinking about how to
    combine individual prices into an overall price level, many people
    find that their first impulse is to calculate the average of the
    prices. Such a calculation, however, could easily be misleading
    because some products matter more than others.

    Calculating an Annual Rate of Inflation

    <a href="#bookmark697" class="s84">Consider the simple basket of goods with only three items, represented in</a>
    Table 9.2<span class="s37">. Say that in any given month, a college
    student spends money on 20 hamburgers, one bottle of aspirin, and
    five movies. The table provides prices for these items over four
    years through each time period (Pd). Prices of some goods in the
    basket may rise while others fall. In this example, the price of
    aspirin does not change over the four years, while movies increase
    in price and hamburgers bounce up and down. The table shows the cost
    of buying the</span>

    Changes in the prices of goods for which people spend a larger share
    of their incomes will matter more than changes in the prices of
    goods for which people spend a smaller share of their incomes. For
    example, an increase of 10% in the rental rate on housing matters
    more to most people than whether the price of carrots rises by 10%.
    To construct an overall measure of the price level, economists
    compute a weighted average of the prices of the items in the basket,
    where the weights are based on the actual quantities of goods and
    services people buy. The following Work It Out feature walks you
    through the steps of calculating the annual rate of inflation based
    on a few products.

    Table 9.2 A College Student’s Basket of Goods

      

    To calculate the annual rate of inflation in this example:

    <span id="bookmark698">Step 1. Find the percentage change in the
    cost of purchasing the overall basket of goods between the time
    periods. The general equation for percentage changes between two
    years, whether in the context of inflation or in any other
    calculation, is:</span>

    ⎝
                                                                                                                                                
     ⎠

    ⎛<span class="s16">Level in new year – Level in previous year
    </span>⎞

    Level in previous year

    x 100 = Percentage change

      

    <a href="#bookmark697" class="s84">Step 2. From period 1 to period 2, the total cost of purchasing the basket of goods in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark697" class="s43">Table 9.2</a> <span
    class="s37">rises from</span>

    $100 to $106.50. Therefore, the percentage change over this time—the
    inflation rate—is:

    (106.50 – 100)

    100.0

    = 0.065 = 6.5%

    Step 3. From period 2 to period 3, the overall change in the cost of
    purchasing the basket rises from $106.50 to $107. Thus, the
    inflation rate over this time, again calculated by the percentage
    change, is approximately:

    (107 – 106.50)

    106.50

    = 0.0047 = 0.47%

    Step 4. From period 3 to period 4, the overall cost rises from $107
    to $117.50. The inflation rate is thus:

    (117.50 – 107)

    107

    = 0.098 = 9.8%

    This calculation of the change in the total cost of purchasing a
    basket of goods accounts for how much a student spends on each good.
    Hamburgers are the lowest-priced good in this example, and aspirin
    is the highest-priced. If an individual buys a greater quantity of a
    low-price good, then it makes sense that changes in the price of
    that good should have a larger impact on the buying power of that
    person’s money. The larger impact of hamburgers shows up in the
    “amount spent” row, where, in all time periods, hamburgers are the
    largest item within the amount spent row.

      

    Index Numbers

    <a href="#bookmark697" class="s34">The numerical results of a calculation based on a basket of goods can get a little messy. The simplified example in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark697" class="a">Table 9.2</a> <span class="p">has
    only three goods and the prices are in even dollars, not numbers
    like 79 cents or $124.99. If the list of products were much longer,
    and we used more realistic prices, the total quantity spent over a
    year might be some</span>

      

      

    messy-looking number like $17,147.51 or $27,654.92.

    <span id="bookmark699">To simplify the task of interpreting the
    price levels for more realistic and complex baskets of goods,
    economists typically report the price level in each period as
    an</span> **index number**, rather than as the dollar amount for
    buying the basket of goods. Economists create price indices to
    calculate an overall average change in relative prices over time. To
    convert the money spent on the basket to an index number, economists
    arbitrarily choose one year to be the **base year**, or starting
    point from which we measure changes in prices. The base year, by
    definition, has an index number equal to 100. This sounds
    complicated, but it is really a simple math trick. In the example
    above, say that we choose time period 3 as the base year. Since the
    total amount of spending in that year is $107, we divide that amount
    by itself ($107) and multiply by 100. Again, this is because the
    index number in the base year *always* has to have a value of<span
    id="bookmark700">‌</span>

    100\. Then, to figure out the values of the index number for the
    other years, we divide the dollar amounts for the other years by
    1.07 as well. Note also that the dollar signs cancel out so that
    index numbers have no units.

    <a href="#bookmark701" class="a">Table 9.3</a>
    <a href="#bookmark697" class="s34">shows calculations for the other values of the index number, based on the example in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark697" class="a">Table</a> 9.2<span class="p">.
    Because we calculate the index numbers so that they are in exactly
    the same proportion as the total dollar cost of purchasing the
    basket of goods, we can calculate the inflation rate based on the
    index numbers, using the percentage change formula. Thus, the
    inflation rate from period 1 to period 2 would be</span>

    (99.5 – 93.4)

    93.4

    = 0.065 = 6.5%

    This is the same answer that we derived when measuring inflation
    based on the dollar cost of the basket of goods for the same time
    period.

    Table 9.3 Calculating Index Numbers When Period 3 is the Base Year

      

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_211.png" width="624" height="51" alt="image" />

    Why do you not just subtract index numbers?

    A word of warning: When a price index moves from, say, 107 to 110,
    the rate of inflation is not *exactly* 3%. Remember, the inflation
    rate is not derived by subtracting the index numbers, but rather
    through the percentage-change calculation. We calculate the precise
    inflation rate as the price index moves from 107 to

    If the inflation rate is the same whether it is based on dollar
    values or index numbers, then why bother with the index numbers? The
    advantage is that indexing allows easier eyeballing of the inflation
    numbers. If you glance at two index numbers like 107 and 110, you
    know automatically that the rate of inflation between the two years
    is about, but not quite exactly equal to, 3%. By contrast, imagine
    that we express the price levels in absolute dollars of a large
    basket of goods, so that when you looked at the data, the numbers
    were $19,493.62 and $20,040.17. Most people find it difficult to
    eyeball those kinds of numbers and say that it is a change of about
    3%. However, the two numbers expressed in absolute dollars are
    exactly in the same proportion of 107 to 110 as the previous
    example. If you’re wondering why simple subtraction of the index
    numbers wouldn’t work, read the following Clear It Up feature.

      

      

    110 as 100 x (110 – 107) / 107 = 100 x 0.028 = 2.8%. When the base
    year is fairly close to 100, a quick subtraction is not a terrible
    shortcut to calculating the inflation rate—but when precision
    matters down to tenths of a percent, subtracting will not give the
    right answer.

      

    Two final points about index numbers are worth remembering. First,
    index numbers have no dollar signs or other units attached to them.
    Although we can use index numbers to calculate a percentage
    inflation rate, the index numbers themselves do not have percentage
    signs. Index numbers just mirror the proportions that we find in
    other data. They transform the other data so that it is easier to
    work with the data.

    Second, the choice of a base year for the index number—that is, the
    year that is automatically set equal to 100—is arbitrary. We choose
    it as a starting point from which we can track changes in prices. In
    the official inflation statistics, it is common to use one base year
    for a few years, and then to update it, so that the base year of 100
    is relatively close to the present. However, any base year that we
    choose for the index numbers will result in exactly the same
    inflation rate. To see this in the previous example, imagine that
    period 1 is the base year when total spending was $100, and we
    assign it an index number of 100. At a glance, you can see that the
    index numbers would now exactly match the dollar figures, and the
    inflation rate in the first period would be 6.5%.

    Now that we see how indexes work to track inflation, the next module
    will show us how economists measure the cost of living.

      

      

2.  <span id="bookmark684">|</span> <span style=" color: #3767B1;">How
    to Measure Changes in the Cost of Living</span><span
    id="bookmark702">‌</span>

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Use the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to calculate U.S. inflation
        rates

    -   Identify several ways the Bureau of Labor Statistics avoids
        biases in the Consumer Price Index (CPI)

    -   Differentiate among the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the Producer
        Price Index (PPI), the International Price Index, the Employment
        Cost Index, and the GDP deflator.

      

    <span id="bookmark703">The most commonly cited measure of inflation
    in the United States is the</span> **Consumer Price Index (CPI)**.
    Government statisticians at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
    calculate the CPI based on the prices in a fixed basket of goods and
    services that represents the purchases of the average family of
    four. In recent years, the statisticians have paid considerable
    attention to a subtle problem: that the change in the total cost of
    buying a fixed basket of goods and services over time is
    conceptually not quite the same as the change in the cost of living,
    because the cost of living represents how much it costs for a person
    to feel that his or her consumption provides an equal level of
    satisfaction or utility.<span id="bookmark704">‌</span>

    To understand the distinction, imagine that over the past 10 years,
    the cost of purchasing a fixed basket of goods increased by 25% and
    your salary also increased by 25%. Has your personal standard of
    living held constant? If you

      

      

    do not necessarily purchase an identical fixed basket of goods every
    year, then an inflation calculation based on the cost of a fixed
    basket of goods may be a misleading measure of how your cost of
    living has changed. Two problems arise here: substitution bias and
    quality/new goods bias.

    <span id="bookmark705">When the price of a good rises, consumers
    tend to purchase less of it and to seek out substitutes instead.
    Conversely, as the price of a good falls, people will tend to
    purchase more of it. This pattern implies that goods with generally
    rising prices should tend over time to become less important in the
    overall basket of goods used to calculate inflation, while goods
    with falling prices should tend to become more important. Consider,
    as an example, a rise in the price of peaches by $100 per pound. If
    consumers were utterly inflexible in their demand for peaches, this
    would lead to a big rise in the price of food for consumers.
    Alternatively, imagine that people are utterly indifferent to
    whether they have peaches or other types of fruit. Now, if peach
    prices rise, people completely switch to other fruit choices and the
    average price of food does not change at all. A fixed and unchanging
    basket of goods assumes that consumers are locked into buying
    exactly the same goods, regardless of price changes—not a very
    likely assumption. Thus,</span> **substitution bias**—the rise in
    the price of a fixed basket of goods over time—tends to overstate
    the rise in a consumer’s true cost of living, because it does not
    take into account that the person can substitute away from goods
    whose relative prices have risen.

    (http://openstax.org/l/Fords) <span style=" color: #000;">to view a
    list of Ford car prices between 1909 and 1927. Consider how these
    prices compare to today’s models. Is the product today of a
    different quality?</span>

    The other major problem in using a fixed basket of goods as the
    basis for calculating inflation is how to deal with the arrival of
    improved versions of older goods or altogether new goods. Consider
    the problem that arises if a cereal is improved by adding 12
    essential vitamins and minerals—and also if a box of the cereal
    costs 5% more. It would clearly be misleading to count the entire
    resulting higher price as inflation, because the new price reflects
    a higher quality (or at least different) product. Ideally, one would
    like to know how much of the higher price is due to the quality
    change, and how much of it is just a higher price. The Bureau of
    Labor Statistics, which is responsible for computing the Consumer
    Price Index, must deal with these difficulties in adjusting for
    quality changes.

      

      

    We can think of a new product as an extreme improvement in
    quality—from something that did not exist to something that does.
    However, the basket of goods that was fixed in the past obviously
    does not include new goods created since then. The basket of goods
    and services in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is revised and
    updated over time, and so new products are gradually included.
    However, the process takes some time. For example, room air
    conditioners were widely sold in the early 1950s, but were not
    introduced into the basket of goods behind the Consumer Price Index
    until 1964. The VCR and personal computer were available in the late
    1970s and widely sold by the early 1980s, but did not enter the CPI
    basket of goods until 1987. By 1996, there were more than 40 million
    cellular phone subscribers in the United States—but cell phones were
    not yet part of the CPI basket of goods. The parade of inventions
    has continued, with the CPI inevitably lagging a few years behind.

    <span id="bookmark706">The arrival of new goods creates problems
    with respect to the accuracy of measuring inflation. The reason
    people buy new goods, presumably, is that the new goods offer better
    value for money than existing goods. Thus, if the price index leaves
    out new goods, it overlooks one of the ways in which the cost of
    living is improving. In addition, the price of a new good is often
    higher when it is first introduced and then declines over time. If
    the new good is not included in the CPI for some years, until its
    price is already lower, the CPI may miss counting this price decline
    altogether. Taking these arguments together, the</span>
    **quality/new goods bias** means that the rise in the price of a
    fixed basket of goods over time tends to overstate the rise in a
    consumer’s true cost of living, because it does not account

    for how improvements in the quality of existing goods or the
    invention of new goods improves the standard of living. The
    following Clear It Up feature is a must-read on how statisticians
    comprise and calculate the CPI.

      

    How do U.S. government statisticians measure the Consumer Price
    Index?

    When the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) calculates the
    Consumer Price Index, the first task is to decide on a basket of
    goods that is representative of the purchases of the average
    household. We do this by using the Consumer Expenditure Survey, a
    national survey of about 7,000 households, which provides detailed
    information on spending habits. Statisticians divide consumer
    expenditures into eight major groups (seen below), which in turn
    they divide into more than 200 individual item categories. The BLS
    currently uses 1982–1984 as the base period.

    For each of the 200 individual expenditure items, the BLS chooses
    several hundred very specific examples of that item and looks at the
    prices of those examples. In figuring out the “breakfast cereal”
    item under the overall category of “foods and beverages,” the BLS
    picks several hundred examples of breakfast cereal. One example
    might be the price of a 24-oz. box of a particular brand of cereal
    sold at a particular store. The BLS statistically selects specific
    products and sizes and stores to reflect what people buy and where
    they shop. The basket of goods in the Consumer Price Index thus
    consists of about 80,000 products; that is, several hundred specific
    products in over 200 broad-item categories. Statisticians rotate
    about one-quarter of these 80,000 specific products of the sample
    each year, and replace them with a different set of products.

    The next step is to collect data on prices. Data collectors visit or
    call about 23,000 stores in 87 urban areas all over the United
    States every month to collect prices on these 80,000 specific
    products. The BLS also conducts a survey of 50,000 landlords or
    tenants to collect information about rents.

    <a href="#bookmark707" class="s84">Statisticians then calculate the Consumer Price Index by taking the 80,000 prices of individual products and combining them, using weights (see</a>
    <a href="#bookmark707" class="s43">Figure</a> 9.2<span class="s37">)
    determined by the quantities of these products that people buy and
    allowing for factors like substitution between goods and quality
    improvements, into price indices for the 200 or so overall items.
    Then, the statisticians combine the price indices for the 200 items
    into an overall Consumer Price Index. According the Consumer Price
    Index website, there are eight categories that data collectors
    use:</span>

    The Eight Major Categories in the Consumer Price Index

    1.  Food and beverages (breakfast cereal, milk, coffee, chicken,
        wine, full-service meals, and snacks)

    2.  Housing (renter’s cost of housing, homeowner’s cost of housing,
        fuel oil, bedroom furniture)

    3.  Apparel (men’s shirts and sweaters, women’s dresses, jewelry)

    4.  Transportation (new vehicles, airline fares, gasoline, motor
        vehicle insurance)

    5.  Medical care (prescription drugs and medical supplies,
        physicians’ services, eyeglasses and eye care, hospital
        services)

    6.  Recreation (televisions, cable television, pets and pet
        products, sports equipment, admissions)

    7.  Education and communication (college tuition, postage, telephone
        services, computer software and accessories)

    8.  Other goods and services (tobacco and smoking products, haircuts
        and other personal services, funeral expenses)

        <span id="bookmark707">The CPI and Core Inflation Index</span>

        Imagine if you were driving a company truck across the country-
        you probably would care about things like the prices of
        available roadside food and motel rooms as well as the truck’s
        operating condition. However, the manager of the firm might have
        different priorities. He would care mostly about the truck’s
        on-time performance and much less so about the food you were
        eating and the places you were staying. In other words, the
        company manager would be paying attention to the firm's
        production, while ignoring transitory elements that impacted
        you, but did not affect the company’s bottom line.

        <span id="bookmark708">In a sense, a similar situation occurs
        with regard to measures of inflation. As we’ve learned, CPI
        measures prices as they affect everyday household spending.
        Economists typically calculate a</span> **core inflation index**
        by taking the CPI and excluding volatile economic variables. In
        this way, economists have a better sense of the underlying
        trends in prices that affect the cost of living.

        Examples of excluded variables include energy and food prices,
        which can jump around from month to month because of the
        weather. According to an article by Kent Bernhard, during
        Hurricane Katrina in 2005, a key supply point for the nation’s
        gasoline was nearly knocked out. Gas prices quickly shot up
        across the nation, in some places by up to 40 cents a gallon in
        one day. This was not the cause of an economic policy but rather
        a short-lived event until the pumps were restored in the region.
        In this case, the CPI that month would register the change as a
        cost of living event to households, but the core inflation index
        would remain unchanged. As a result, the Federal Reserve’s
        decisions on interest rates would not be influenced. Similarly,
        droughts can cause world-wide spikes in food prices that, if
        temporary, do not affect the nation’s economic capability.

        As former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke noted in
        1999 about the core inflation index, “It provide(s) a better
        guide to monetary policy than the other indices, since it
        measures the more persistent underlying inflation rather than
        transitory influences on the price level.” Bernanke also noted
        that it helps communicate that the Federal Reserve does not need
        to respond to every inflationary shock since some price changes
        are transitory and not part of a structural change in the
        economy.

        In sum, both the CPI and the core inflation index are important,
        but serve different audiences. The CPI helps households
        understand their overall cost of living from month to month,
        while the core inflation index is a preferred gauge from which
        to make important government policy changes.

          

        Practical Solutions for the Substitution and the Quality/New
        Goods Biases

        By the early 2000s, the Bureau of Labor Statistics was using
        alternative mathematical methods for calculating the Consumer
        Price Index, more complicated than just adding up the cost of a
        fixed basket of goods, to allow for some substitution between
        goods. It was also updating the basket of goods behind the CPI
        more frequently, so that it could include new and improved goods
        more rapidly. For certain products, the BLS was carrying out
        studies to try to measure the quality improvement. For example,
        with computers, an economic study can try to adjust for changes
        in speed, memory, screen size, and other product
        characteristics, and then calculate the change in price after
        accounting for these product changes. However, these adjustments
        are inevitably imperfect, and exactly how to make these
        adjustments is often a source of controversy among professional
        economists.

        By the early 2000s, the substitution bias and quality/new goods
        bias had been somewhat reduced, so that since then the rise in
        the CPI probably overstates the true rise in inflation by only
        about 0.5% per year. Over one or a few years, this is not much.
        Over a period of a decade or two, even half of a percent per
        year compounds to a more significant amount. In addition, the
        CPI tracks prices from physical locations, and not at online
        sites like Amazon, where prices can be lower.

        When measuring inflation (and other economic statistics, too), a
        tradeoff arises between simplicity and interpretation. If we
        calculate the inflation rate with a basket of goods that is
        fixed and unchanging, then the calculation of an inflation rate
        is straightforward, but the problems of substitution bias and
        quality/new goods bias will arise. However, when the basket of
        goods is allowed to shift and evolve to reflect substitution
        toward lower relative prices, quality improvements, and new
        goods, the technical details of calculating the inflation rate
        grow more complex.

        Additional Price Indices: PPI, GDP Deflator, and More

        The basket of goods behind the Consumer Price Index represents
        an average hypothetical U.S. household's consumption, which is
        to say that it does not exactly capture anyone’s personal
        experience. When the task is to calculate an average level of
        inflation, this approach works fine. What if, however, you are
        concerned about inflation experienced by a certain group, like
        the elderly, or the poor, or single-parent families with
        children, or Hispanic- Americans? In specific situations, a
        price index based on the buying power of the average consumer
        may not feel quite right.

        This problem has a straightforward solution. If the Consumer
        Price Index does not serve the desired purpose, then invent
        another index, based on a basket of goods appropriate for the
        group of interest. The Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes a
        number of experimental price indices: some for particular groups
        like the elderly or the poor, some for different geographic
        areas, and some for certain broad categories of goods like food
        or housing.

        <span id="bookmark709">The BLS also calculates several price
        indices that are not based on baskets of consumer goods. For
        example, the</span> **Producer Price Index (PPI)** is based on
        prices paid for supplies and inputs by producers of goods and
        services. We can break it down into price indices for different
        industries, commodities, and stages of processing (like finished
        goods, intermediate goods, or crude materials for further
        processing). There is an **International Price Index** based on
        the prices of merchandise that is exported or imported. An
        **Employment Cost Index** measures wage inflation in the labor
        market. The **GDP
        deflator**<a href="http://bpp.mit.edu/usa/)" class="s34">, which the Bureau of Economic Analysis measures, is a price index that includes all the GDP components (that is, consumption plus investment plus government plus exports minus imports). Unlike the CPI, its baskets are not fixed but re-calculate what that year’s GDP would have been worth using the base-year’s prices. MIT's Billion Prices Project is a more recent alternative attempt to measure prices: economists collect data online from retailers and then put them into an index that they compare to the CPI (Source: http://bpp.mit.edu/usa/).</a><span

        id="bookmark712">‌</span>

        What’s the best measure of inflation? If one is concerned with
        the most accurate measure of inflation, one should use the GDP
        deflator as it picks up the prices of goods and services
        produced. However, it is not a good measure of the cost of
        living as it includes prices of many products not purchased by
        households (for example, aircraft, fire engines, factory
        buildings, office complexes, and bulldozers). If one wants the
        most accurate measure of inflation as it impacts households, one
        should use the CPI, as it only picks up prices of products
        purchased by households. That is why economists sometimes refer
        to the CPI as the cost-of-living index. As the Bureau of Labor
        Statistics states on its website: “The ‘best’ measure of
        inflation for a given application depends on the intended use of
        the data.”

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Identify patterns of inflation for the United States using data
        from the Consumer Price Index

    -   Identify patterns of inflation on an international level

      

    In the last three decades, inflation has been relatively low in the
    U.S. economy, with the Consumer Price Index typically rising 2% to
    4% per year. Looking back over the twentieth century, there have
    been several periods where inflation caused the price level to rise
    at double-digit rates, but nothing has come close to hyperinflation.

    Historical Inflation in the U.S. Economy

        trends in the U.S. price level from the year 1913 to 2016. In
        1913, the graph starts out close to 10, rises to around 20 in
        1920, stays around 16 or 17 until 1931, then falls to 13 or 14
        until 1940. It gradually increases until about 1973, then
        increases more rapidly through the remainder of the 1970s and
        beyond, with periodic dips, until 2016, when it reached
        around 240. Graph b shows the trends in U.S. inflation rates
        from the year 1914 to 2016. In 1916, the graph starts out with
        inflation at almost 8%, jumps to about 17% in 1917, drops
        drastically to close to –11% in 1921, goes up and down
        periodically, with peaks in the 1940s and the 1970s, until
        settling to around 1.3% in 2016.</span>

          

        <span id="bookmark715">The first two waves of inflation are easy
        to characterize in historical terms: they are right after World
        War I and World War II. However, there are also two periods of
        severe negative inflation—called</span> **deflation**—in the
        early decades of the twentieth century: one following the deep
        1920-21 recession of and the other during the 1930s Great
        Depression of the 1930s. (Since inflation is a time when the
        buying power of money in terms of goods and services is reduced,
        deflation will be a time when the buying power of money in terms
        of goods and services increases.) For the period from 1900 to
        about 1960, the major inflations and deflations nearly balanced
        each other out, so the average annual rate of inflation over
        these years was only about 1% per year. A third wave of more
        severe inflation arrived in the

        <span id="bookmark716">Times of recession or depression often
        seem to be times when the inflation rate is lower, as in the
        recession of 1920–1921, the Great Depression, the recession of
        1980–1982, and the Great Recession in 2008–2009. There were a
        few months in 2009 that were deflationary, but not at an annual
        rate. High levels of unemployment typically accompany
        recessions, and the total demand for goods falls, pulling the
        price level down. Conversely, the rate of inflation often, but
        not always, seems to start moving up when the economy is growing
        very strongly, like right after wartime or during the 1960s. The
        frameworks for macroeconomic analysis, that we developed in
        other chapters, will explain why recession often accompanies
        higher unemployment and lower inflation, while rapid economic
        growth often brings lower unemployment but higher
        inflation.</span>

        for the United Kingdom was almost 25%. In the 1980s, inflation
        rates came down in the United States and in Europe and have
        largely stayed down.</span>

        <span id="bookmark718">Countries with controlled economies in
        the 1970s, like the Soviet Union and China, historically had
        very low rates of measured inflation—because prices were
        forbidden to rise by law, except for the cases where the
        government deemed a price increase to be due to quality
        improvements. However, these countries also had perpetual
        shortages of goods, since forbidding prices to rise acts like a
        price ceiling and creates a situation where quantity demanded
        often exceeds quantity supplied. As Russia and China made a
        transition toward more market-oriented economies, they also
        experienced outbursts of inflation, although we should regard
        the statistics for these economies as somewhat shakier.
        Inflation in China averaged about 10% per year for much of the
        1980s and early 1990s, although it has dropped off since then.

        Many countries in Latin America experienced raging inflation
        during the 1980s and early 1990s, with inflation rates often
        well above 100% per year. In 1990, for example, both Brazil and
        Argentina saw inflation climb above 2000%. Certain countries in
        Africa experienced extremely high rates of inflation, sometimes
        bordering on hyperinflation, in the 1990s. Nigeria, the most
        populous country in Africa, had an inflation rate of 75%
        in 1995.

        In the early 2000s, the problem of inflation appears to have
        diminished for most countries, at least in comparison to the
        worst times of recent decades. As we noted in this earlier Bring
        it Home feature, in recent years, the world’s worst example of
        hyperinflation was in Zimbabwe, where at one point the
        government was issuing bills with a face value of $100 trillion
        (in Zimbabwean dollars)—that is, the bills had
        $100,000,000,000,000 written on the front, but were almost
        worthless. In many countries, the memory of double-digit,
        triple-digit, and even quadruple-digit inflation is not very far
        in the past.

        Inflation</span><span id="bookmark720">‌</span>

        By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        -   Explain how inflation can cause redistributions of
            purchasing power

        -   Identify ways inflation can blur the perception of supply
            and demand

        -   Explain the economic benefits and challenges of inflation

          

        <span id="bookmark721">Economists usually oppose high inflation,
        but they oppose it in a milder way than many non-economists.
        Robert Shiller, one of 2013’s Nobel Prize winners in economics,
        carried out several surveys during the 1990s about attitudes
        toward inflation. One of his questions asked, “Do you agree that
        preventing high inflation is an important national priority, as
        important as preventing drug abuse or preventing deterioration
        in the quality of our schools?” Answers were on a scale of 1–5,
        where 1 meant “Fully agree” and 5 meant “Completely disagree.”
        For the U.S. population as a whole, 52% answered “Fully agree”
        that preventing high inflation was a highly important national
        priority and just 4% said “Completely disagree.” However, among
        professional economists, only 18% answered “Fully agree,” while
        the same percentage of 18% answered “Completely
        disagree.”</span>

        The Land of Funny Money

        <span id="bookmark722">What are the economic problems caused by
        inflation, and why do economists often regard them with less
        concern than the general public? Consider a very short story:
        “The Land of Funny Money.”</span>

        One morning, everyone in the Land of Funny Money awakened to
        find that everything denominated in money had increased by 20%.
        The change was completely unexpected. Every price in every store
        was 20% higher. Paychecks were 20% higher. Interest rates were
        20 % higher. The amount of money, everywhere from wallets to
        savings accounts, was 20% larger. This overnight inflation of
        prices made newspaper headlines everywhere in the Land of Funny
        Money. However, the headlines quickly disappeared, as people
        realized that in terms of what they could actually buy with
        their incomes, this inflation had no economic impact. Everyone’s
        pay could still buy exactly the same set of goods as it did
        before. Everyone’s savings were still sufficient to buy exactly
        the same car, vacation, or retirement that they could have
        bought before. Equal levels of inflation in all wages and prices
        ended up not mattering much at all.

        When the people in Robert Shiller’s surveys explained their
        concern about inflation, one typical reason was that they feared
        that as prices rose, they would not be able to afford to buy as
        much. In other words, people were worried because they did not
        live in a place like the Land of Funny Money, where all prices
        and wages rose simultaneously. Instead, people live here on
        Planet Earth, where prices might rise while wages do not rise at
        all, or where wages rise more slowly than prices.

          

          

        <span id="bookmark723">Economists note that over most periods,
        the inflation level in prices is roughly similar to the
        inflation level in wages, and so they reason that, on average,
        over time, people’s economic status is not greatly changed by
        inflation. If all prices, wages, and interest rates adjusted
        automatically and immediately with inflation, as in the Land of
        Funny Money, then no one’s purchasing power, profits, or real
        loan payments would change. However, if other economic variables
        do not move exactly in sync with inflation, or if they adjust
        for inflation only after a time lag, then inflation can cause
        three types of problems: unintended redistributions of
        purchasing power, blurred price signals, and difficulties in
        long-term planning.</span><span id="bookmark724">‌</span>

        Unintended Redistributions of Purchasing Power

        Inflation can cause redistributions of purchasing power that
        hurt some and help others. People who are hurt by inflation
        include those who are holding considerable cash, whether it is
        in a safe deposit box or in a cardboard box under the bed. When
        inflation happens, the buying power of cash diminishes. However,
        cash is only an example of a more general problem: anyone who
        has financial assets invested in a way that the nominal return
        does not keep up with inflation will tend to suffer from
        inflation. For example, if a person has money in a bank account
        that pays 4% interest, but inflation rises to 5%, then the real
        rate of return for the money invested in that bank account is
        negative 1%.

        <span id="bookmark725">The problem of a good-looking nominal
        interest rate transforming into an ugly-looking real interest
        rate can be worsened by taxes. The U.S. income tax is charged on
        the nominal interest received in dollar terms, without an
        adjustment for inflation. Thus, the government taxes a person
        who invests $10,000 and receives a 5% nominal rate of interest
        on the $500 received—no matter whether the inflation rate is 0%,
        5%, or 10%. If inflation is 0%, then the real interest rate is
        5% and all $500 is a gain in buying power. However, if inflation
        is 5%, then the real interest rate is zero and the person had no
        real gain—but owes income tax on the nominal gain anyway. If
        inflation is 10%, then the real interest rate is</span>
        *negative* 5% and the person is actually falling behind in
        buying power, but would still owe taxes on the $500 in nominal
        gains.

        <a href="#bookmark693" id="bookmark726" class="s34">Inflation can cause unintended redistributions for wage earners, too. Wages do typically creep up with inflation over time, eventually. The last row of</a>
        <a href="#bookmark693" class="a">Table 9.1</a>
        <a href="#bookmark727" class="s34">at the start of this chapter showed that the average hourly wage in manufacturing in the U.S. economy increased from $3.23 in 1970 to $20.65 in 2017, which is an increase by a factor of more than six. Over that time period, the Consumer Price Index increased by an almost identical amount. However, increases in wages may lag behind inflation for a year or two, since wage adjustments are often somewhat sticky and occur only once or twice a year. Moreover, the extent to which wages keep up with inflation creates insecurity for workers and may involve painful, prolonged conflicts between employers and employees. If the government adjusts minimum wage for inflation only infrequently, minimum wage workers are losing purchasing power from their nominal wages, as</a>
        <a href="#bookmark727" class="a">Figure 9.6</a> <span
        class="p">shows.</span>

        <span id="bookmark727">Figure 9.6 U.S. Minimum Wage and
        Inflation</span>
        <a href="http://www.dol.gov/whd/minwage/chart.htm%3B" class="s84">After adjusting for inflation, the federal minimum wage dropped more than 30 percent from 1967 to 2010, even though the nominal figure climbed from $1.40 to $7.25 per hour. Increases in the minimum wage in between 2008 and 2010 kept the decline from being worse—as it would have been if the wage had remained the same as it did from 1997 through 2007. Since 2010, the real minimum wage has continued to decline. (Sources: http://www.dol.gov/whd/minwage/chart.htm;</a>
        <http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/surveymost?cu)>

          

        <span id="bookmark728">One sizable group of people has often
        received a large share of their income in a form that does not
        increase over time: retirees who receive a private company
        pension. Most pensions have traditionally been set as a fixed
        nominal dollar amount per year at retirement. For this reason,
        economists call pensions “defined benefits” plans. Even if
        inflation is low, the combination of inflation and a fixed
        income can create a substantial problem over time. A person who
        retires on a fixed income at age 65 will find that losing just
        1% to 2% of buying power per year to inflation compounds to a
        considerable loss of buying power after a decade or two.</span>

        <span id="bookmark729">Fortunately, pensions and other defined
        benefits retirement plans are increasingly rare, replaced
        instead by “defined contribution” plans, such as 401(k)s and
        403(b)s. In these plans, the employer contributes a fixed amount
        to the worker’s retirement account on a regular basis (usually
        every pay check). The employee often contributes as well. The
        worker invests these funds in a wide range of investment
        vehicles. These plans are tax deferred, and they are portable so
        that if the individual takes a job with a different employer,
        their 401(k) comes with them. To the extent that the investments
        made generate real rates of return, retirees do not suffer from
        the inflation costs of traditional pensioners.</span>

        However, ordinary people can sometimes benefit from the
        unintended redistributions of inflation. Consider someone who
        borrows $10,000 to buy a car at a fixed interest rate of 9%. If
        inflation is 3% at the time the loan is made, then he or she
        must repay the loan at a real interest rate of 6%. However, if
        inflation rises to 9%, then the real interest rate on the loan
        is zero. In this case, the borrower’s benefit from inflation is
        the lender’s loss. A borrower paying a fixed interest rate, who
        benefits from inflation, is just the flip side of an investor
        receiving a fixed interest rate, who suffers

          

          

        from inflation. The lesson is that when interest rates are
        fixed, rises in the rate of inflation tend to penalize suppliers
        of financial capital, who receive repayment in dollars that are
        worth less because of inflation, while demanders of financial
        capital end up better off, because they can repay their loans in
        dollars that are worth less than originally expected.

        Is there a connection between German hyperinflation and Hitler’s
        rise to power?

        Germany suffered an intense hyperinflation of its currency, the
        Mark, in the years after World War I, when the Weimar Republic
        in Germany resorted to printing money to pay its bills and the
        onset of the Great Depression created the social turmoil that
        Adolf Hitler was able to take advantage of in his rise to power.
        Shiller described the connection this way in a National Bureau
        of Economic Research 1996 Working Paper:

        A fact that is probably little known to young people today, even
        in Germany, is that the final collapse of the Mark in 1923, the
        time when the Mark’s inflation reached astronomical levels
        (inflation of 35,974.9% in November 1923 alone, for an annual
        rate that month of 4.69 × 10<span class="s65">28</span>%), came
        in the same month as did Hitler’s Beer Hall Putsch, his Nazi
        Party’s armed attempt to overthrow the German government. This
        failed putsch resulted in Hitler’s imprisonment, at which time
        he wrote his book *Mein Kampf*, setting forth an inspirational
        plan for Germany’s future, suggesting plans for world
        domination. . .

        . . . Most people in Germany today probably do not clearly
        remember these events; this lack of attention to it may be
        because its memory is blurred by the more dramatic events that
        succeeded it (the Nazi seizure of power and World War II).
        However, to someone living through these historical events in
        sequence . . . \[the putsch\] may have been remembered as vivid
        evidence of the potential effects of inflation.

        The unintended redistributions of buying power that inflation
        causes may have a broader effect on society. America’s
        widespread acceptance of market forces rests on a perception
        that people’s actions have a reasonable connection to market
        outcomes. When inflation causes a retiree who built up a pension
        or invested at a fixed interest rate to suffer, however, while
        someone who borrowed at a fixed interest rate benefits from
        inflation, it is hard to believe that this outcome was deserved
        in any way. Similarly, when homeowners benefit from inflation
        because the price of their homes rises, while renters suffer
        because they are paying higher rent, it is hard to see any
        useful incentive effects. One of the reasons that the general
        public dislikes inflation is a sense that it makes economic
        rewards and penalties more arbitrary—and therefore likely to be
        perceived as unfair – even dangerous, as the next Clear It Up
        feature shows.

          

          

        Blurred Price Signals

        <span id="bookmark730">Prices are the messengers in a market
        economy, conveying information about conditions of demand and
        supply. Inflation blurs those price messages. Inflation means
        that we perceive price signals more vaguely, like a radio
        program received with considerable static. If the static becomes
        severe, it is hard to tell what is happening.</span>

        In Israel, when inflation accelerated to an annual rate of 500%
        in 1985, some stores stopped posting prices directly on items,
        since they would have had to put new labels on the items or
        shelves every few days to reflect inflation. Instead, a shopper
        just took items from a shelf and went up to the checkout
        register to find out the price for that day. Obviously, this
        situation makes comparing prices and shopping for the best deal
        rather difficult. When the levels and changes of prices become
        uncertain, businesses and individuals find it harder to react to
        economic signals. In a world where inflation is at a high rate,
        but bouncing up and down to some extent, does a higher price of
        a good mean that inflation has risen, or that supply of that
        good has decreased, or that demand for that good has increased?
        Should a buyer of the good take the higher prices as an economic
        hint to start substituting other products—or have the prices of
        the substitutes risen by an equal amount? Should a seller of the
        good take a higher price as a reason to increase production—or
        is the higher price only a sign of a general inflation in which
        the prices of all inputs to production are rising as well? The
        true story will presumably become clear over time, but at a
        given moment, who can say?

          

          

        <span id="bookmark731">High and variable inflation means that
        the incentives in the economy to adjust in response to changes
        in prices are weaker. Markets will adjust toward their
        equilibrium prices and quantities more erratically and slowly,
        and many individual markets will experience a greater chance of
        surpluses and shortages.</span>

        Problems of Long-Term Planning

        <span id="bookmark732">Inflation can make long-term planning
        difficult. In discussing unintended redistributions, we
        considered the case of someone trying to plan for retirement
        with a pension that is fixed in nominal terms and a high rate of
        inflation. Similar problems arise for all people trying to save
        for retirement, because they must consider what their money will
        really buy several decades in the future when we cannot know the
        rate of future inflation.</span>

        Inflation, especially at moderate or high levels, will pose
        substantial planning problems for businesses, too. A firm can
        make money from inflation—for example, by paying bills and wages
        as late as possible so that it can pay in inflated dollars,
        while collecting revenues as soon as possible. A firm can also
        suffer losses from inflation, as in the case of a retail
        business that gets stuck holding too much cash, only to see
        inflation eroding the value of that cash. However, when a
        business spends its time focusing on how to profit by inflation,
        or at least how to avoid suffering from it, an inevitable
        tradeoff strikes: less time is spent on improving products and
        services or on figuring out how to make existing products and
        services more cheaply. An economy with high inflation rewards
        businesses that have found clever ways of profiting from
        inflation, which are not necessarily the businesses that excel
        at productivity, innovation, or quality of service.

        <a href="#bookmark733" class="s34">In the short term, low or moderate levels of inflation may not pose an overwhelming difficulty for business planning, because costs of doing business and sales revenues may rise at similar rates. If, however, inflation varies substantially over the short or medium term, then it may make sense for businesses to stick to shorter-term strategies. The evidence as to whether relatively low rates of inflation reduce productivity is controversial among economists. There is some evidence that if inflation can be held to moderate levels of less than 3% per year, it need not prevent a nation’s real economy from growing at a healthy pace. For some countries that have experienced hyperinflation of several thousand percent per year, an annual inflation rate of 20–30% may feel basically the same as zero. However, several economists have pointed to the suggestive fact that when U.S. inflation heated up in the early 1970s—to 10%—U.S. growth in productivity slowed down, and when inflation slowed down in the 1980s, productivity edged up again not long thereafter, as</a>
        <a href="#bookmark733" class="a">Figure 9.7</a> <span
        class="p">shows.</span>

        Labor Productivity, 1961–2014</span> <span class="s37">Over the
        last several decades in the United States, there have been times
        when rising inflation rates have been closely followed by lower
        productivity rates and lower inflation rates have corresponded
        to increasing productivity rates. As the graph shows, however,
        this correlation does not always exist.</span>

          

        Any Benefits of Inflation?

        Although the economic effects of inflation are primarily
        negative, two countervailing points are worth noting. First,

          

          

        the impact of inflation will differ considerably according to
        whether it is creeping up slowly at 0% to 2% per year, galloping
        along at 10% to 20% per year, or racing to the point of
        hyperinflation at, say, 40% per month. Hyperinflation can rip an
        economy and a society apart. An annual inflation rate of 2%, 3%,
        or 4%, however, is a long way from a national crisis. Low
        inflation is also better than deflation which occurs with severe
        recessions.

        <a href="#bookmark619" id="bookmark734" class="s34">Second, economists sometimes argue that moderate inflation may help the economy by making wages in labor markets more flexible. The discussion in</a>
        <a href="#bookmark619" class="a">Unemployment</a> <span
        class="p">pointed out that wages tend to be sticky in their
        downward movements and that unemployment can result. A little
        inflation could nibble away at real wages, and thus help real
        wages to decline if necessary. In this way, even if a moderate
        or high rate of inflation may act as sand in the gears of the
        economy, perhaps a low rate of inflation serves as oil for the
        gears of the labor market. This argument is controversial. A
        full analysis would have to account for all the effects of
        inflation. It does, however, offer another reason to believe
        that, all things considered, very low rates of inflation may not
        be especially harmful.</span>

          

    3.  <span id="bookmark687">|</span> <span
        style=" color: #3767B1;">Indexing and Its
        Limitations</span><span id="bookmark735">‌</span>

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   Explain the relationship between indexing and inflation

-   Identify three ways the government can control inflation through
    macroeconomic policy

  

<span id="bookmark736">When a price, wage, or interest rate is adjusted
automatically with inflation, economists use the term</span>
**indexed**. An indexed payment increases according to the index number
that measures inflation. Those in private markets and government
programs observe a wide range of indexing arrangements. Since the
negative effects of inflation depend in large part on having inflation
unexpectedly affect one part of the economy but not another—say,
increasing the prices that people pay but not the wages that workers
receive—indexing will take some of the sting out of inflation.<span
id="bookmark737">‌</span>

Indexing in Private Markets

<span id="bookmark738">In the 1970s and 1980s, labor unions commonly
negotiated wage contracts that had</span> **cost-of-living adjustments
(COLAs)** which guaranteed that their wages would keep up with
inflation. These contracts were sometimes written as, for example, COLA
plus 3%. Thus, if inflation was 5%, the wage increase would
automatically be 8%, but if inflation rose to 9%, the wage increase
would automatically be 12%. COLAs are a form of indexing applied to
wages.

<span id="bookmark739">Loans often have built-in inflation adjustments,
too, so that if the inflation rate rises by two percentage points, then
the interest rate that a financial institution charges on the loan rises
by two percentage points as well. An</span> **adjustable- rate mortgage
(ARM)** is a type of loan that one can use to purchase a home in which
the interest rate varies with the rate of inflation. Often, a borrower
will be able receive a lower interest rate if borrowing with an ARM,
compared to a fixed-rate loan. The reason is that with an ARM, the
lender is protected against the risk that higher inflation will reduce
the real loan payments, and so the risk premium part of the interest
rate can be correspondingly lower.

A number of ongoing or long-term business contracts also have provisions
that prices will adjust automatically according to inflation. Sellers
like such contracts because they are not locked into a low nominal
selling price if inflation turns out higher than expected. Buyers like
such contracts because they are not locked into a high buying price if
inflation turns out to be lower than expected. A contract with automatic
adjustments for inflation in effect agrees on a real price for the
borrower to pay, rather than a nominal price.

Indexing in Government Programs

Many government programs are indexed to inflation. The U.S. income tax
code is designed so that as a person’s income rises above certain
levels, the tax rate on the marginal income earned rises as well. That
is what the expression “move into a higher tax bracket” means. For
example, according to the basic tax tables from the Internal Revenue
Service, in 2017 a single person owed 10% of all taxable income from $0
to $9,325; 15% of all income from $9,326 to

$37,950; 25% of all taxable income from $37,951 to $91,900; 28% of all
taxable income from $91,901 to $191,650; 33% of all taxable income from
$191,651 to $416,700; 35% of all taxable income from $416,701 to
$418,400; and 39.6% of all income from $418,401 and above.

Because of the many complex provisions in the rest of the tax code, it
is difficult to determine exactly the taxes an individual owes the
government based on these numbers, but the numbers illustrate the basic
theme that tax rates rise as the marginal dollar of income rises. Until
the late 1970s, if nominal wages increased along with inflation, people
were moved into higher tax brackets and owed a higher proportion of
their income in taxes, even though their real

  

  

income had not risen. In 1981, the government eliminated this “bracket
creep”. Now, the income levels where higher tax rates kick in are
indexed to rise automatically with inflation.

<span id="bookmark740">The Social Security program offers two examples
of indexing. Since the passage of the Social Security Indexing Act of
1972, the level of Social Security benefits increases each year along
with the Consumer Price Index. Also, Social Security is funded by
payroll taxes, which the government imposes on the income earned up to a
certain amount—$117,000 in 2014. The government adjusts this level of
income upward each year according to the rate of inflation, so that an
indexed increase in the Social Security tax base accompanies the indexed
rise in the benefit level.</span>

<span id="bookmark741">As yet another example of a government program
affected by indexing, in 1996 the U.S., government began offering
indexed bonds. Bonds are means by which the U.S. government (and many
private-sector companies as well) borrows money; that is, investors buy
the bonds, and then the government repays the money with interest.
Traditionally, government bonds have paid a fixed rate of interest. This
policy gave a government that had borrowed an incentive to encourage
inflation, because it could then repay its past borrowing in inflated
dollars at a lower real interest rate. However, indexed bonds promise to
pay a certain real rate of interest above whatever inflation rate
occurs. In the case of a retiree trying to plan for the long term and
worried about the risk of inflation, for example, indexed bonds that
guarantee a rate of return higher than inflation—no matter the level of
inflation—can be a very comforting investment.</span>

Might Indexing Reduce Concern over Inflation?

Indexing may seem like an obviously useful step. After all, when
individuals, firms, and government programs are indexed against
inflation, then people can worry less about arbitrary redistributions
and other effects of inflation.

However, some of the fiercest opponents of inflation express grave
concern about indexing. They point out that indexing is always partial.
Not every employer will provide COLAs for workers. Not all companies can
assume that costs and revenues will rise in lockstep with the general
rates of inflation. Not all interest rates for borrowers and savers will
change to match inflation exactly. However, as partial inflation
indexing spreads, the political opposition to inflation may diminish.
After all, older people whose Social Security benefits are protected
against inflation, or banks that have loaned their money with
adjustable-rate loans, no longer have as much reason to care whether
inflation heats up. In a world where some people are indexed against
inflation and some are not, financially savvy businesses and investors
may seek out ways to be protected against inflation, while the
financially unsophisticated and small businesses may suffer from it
most.

A Preview of Policy Discussions of Inflation

This chapter has focused on how economists measure inflation, historical
experience with inflation, how to adjust nominal variables into real
ones, how inflation affects the economy, and how indexing works. We have
barely hinted at the causes of inflation, and we have not addressed
government policies to deal with inflation. We will examine these issues
in depth in other chapters. However, it is useful to offer a preview
here.

We can sum up the cause of inflation in one phrase: Too many dollars
chasing too few goods. The great surges of inflation early in the
twentieth century came after wars, which are a time when government
spending is very high, but consumers have little to buy, because
production is going to the war effort. Governments also commonly impose
price controls during wartime. After the war, the price controls end and
pent-up buying power surges forth, driving up inflation. Otherwise, if
too few dollars are chasing too many goods, then inflation will decline
or even turn into deflation. Therefore, we typically associate slowdowns
in economic activity, as in major recessions and the Great Depression,
with a reduction in inflation or even outright deflation.

The policy implications are clear. If we are to avoid inflation, the
amount of purchasing power in the economy must grow at roughly the same
rate as the production of goods. Macroeconomic policies that the
government can use to affect the amount of purchasing power—through
taxes, spending, and regulation of interest rates and credit—can thus
cause inflation to rise or reduce inflation to lower levels.

A $550 Million Loaf of Bread?

<a href="#bookmark1071" class="s84">As we will learn in</a> Money and
Banking<span class="s37">, the existence of money provides enormous
benefits to an economy. In a real sense, money is the lubrication that
enhances the workings of markets. Money makes transactions easier. It
allows people to find employment producing one product, then use the
money earned to purchase the other products they need to live. However,
too much money in circulation can lead to inflation. Extreme cases of
governments recklessly printing money lead to hyperinflation. Inflation
reduces the value of money. Hyperinflation, because money loses value so
quickly, ultimately results in people no longer using money. The economy
reverts to barter, or it adopts another country’s more stable currency,
like U.S. dollars. In the meantime, the economy literally falls apart as
people leave jobs and fend for themselves because it is not worth the
time to work for money that will be worthless in a few days.</span>

Only national governments have the power to cause hyperinflation.
Hyperinflation typically happens when government faces extraordinary
demands for spending, which it cannot finance by taxes or borrowing. The
only option is to print money—more and more of it. With more money in
circulation chasing the same amount (or even fewer) goods and services,
the only result is increasingly higher prices until the economy and/or
the government collapses. This is why economists are generally wary of
letting inflation spiral out of control.

KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY

  

1.  <a href="#bookmark692" class="a">Tracking</a>
    [Inflation](#bookmark692)

    Economists measure the price level by using a basket of goods and
    services and calculating how the total cost of

      

      

    buying that basket of goods will increase over time. Economists
    often express the price level in terms of index numbers, which
    transform the cost of buying the basket of goods and services into a
    series of numbers in the same proportion to each other, but with an
    arbitrary base year of 100. We measure the inflation rate as the
    percentage change between price levels or index numbers over time.

      

2.  <a href="#bookmark702" class="a">How to Measure Changes in the Cost of</a>
    [Living](#bookmark702)

    Measuring price levels with a fixed basket of goods will always have
    two problems: the substitution bias, by which a fixed basket of
    goods does not allow for buying more of what becomes relatively less
    expensive and less of what becomes relatively more expensive; and
    the quality/new goods bias, by which a fixed basket cannot account
    for improvements in quality and the advent of new goods. These
    problems can be reduced in degree—for example, by allowing the
    basket of goods to evolve over time—but we cannot totally eliminate
    them. The most commonly cited measure of inflation is the Consumer
    Price Index (CPI), which is based on a basket of goods representing
    what the typical consumer buys. The Core Inflation Index further
    breaks down the CPI by excluding volatile economic commodities.
    Several price indices are not based on baskets of consumer goods.
    The GDP deflator is based on all GDP components. The Producer Price
    Index is based on prices of supplies and inputs bought by producers
    of goods and services. An Employment Cost Index measures wage
    inflation in the labor market. An International Price Index is based
    on the prices of merchandise that is exported or imported.

      

3.  <a href="#bookmark713" class="a">How the U.S. and Other Countries Experience</a>
    [Inflation](#bookmark713)

    In the U.S. economy, the annual inflation rate in the last two
    decades has typically been around 2% to 4%. The periods of highest
    inflation in the United States in the twentieth century occurred
    during the years after World Wars I and II, and in the 1970s. The
    period of lowest inflation—actually, with deflation—was the 1930s
    Great Depression.

      

4.  <a href="#bookmark720" class="a">The Confusion Over</a>
    [Inflation](#bookmark720)

    Unexpected inflation will tend to hurt those whose money received,
    in terms of wages and interest payments, does not rise with
    inflation. In contrast, inflation can help those who owe money that
    they can pay in less valuable, inflated dollars. Low rates of
    inflation have relatively little economic impact over the short
    term. Over the medium and the long term, even low rates of inflation
    can complicate future planning. High rates of inflation can muddle
    price signals in the short term and prevent market forces from
    operating efficiently, and can vastly complicate long-term savings
    and investment decisions.

      

5.  <a href="#bookmark735" class="a">Indexing and Its</a>
    [Limitations](#bookmark735)

A payment is indexed if it is automatically adjusted for inflation.
Examples of indexing in the private sector include wage contracts with
cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) and loan agreements like
adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs). Examples of indexing in the public
sector include tax brackets and Social Security payments.

    REVIEW QUESTIONS

      

11. How do economists use a basket of goods and services to measure the
    price level?

12. Why do economists use index numbers to measure the price level
    rather than dollar value of goods?

13. What is the difference between the price level and the rate of
    inflation?

14. Why does “substitution bias” arise if we calculate the inflation
    rate based on a fixed basket of goods?

15. Why does the “quality/new goods bias” arise if we calculate the
    inflation rate based on a fixed basket of goods?

      

    CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS

      

    1.  Inflation rates, like most statistics, are imperfect measures.
        Can you identify some ways that the inflation rate for fruit
        does not perfectly capture the rising price of fruit?

    2.  Given the federal budget deficit in recent years, some
        economists have argued that by adjusting Social Security
        payments for inflation using the CPI, Social Security is
        overpaying recipients. What is their argument, and do you agree
        or disagree with it?

    3.  Why is the GDP deflator not an accurate measure of inflation as
        it impacts a household?

    4.  Imagine that the government statisticians who calculate the
        inflation rate have been updating the basic basket of goods once
        every 10 years, but now they decide to update it every five
        years. How will this change affect the amount of substitution
        bias and quality/new goods bias?

    5.  Describe a situation, either a government policy situation, an
        economic problem, or a private sector situation, where using the
        CPI to convert from nominal to real would be more appropriate
        than using the GDP deflator.

16. What has been a typical range of inflation in the

    U.S. economy in the last decade or so?

17. Over the last century, during what periods was the

    U.S. inflation rate highest and lowest?

18. What is deflation?

19. Identify several parties likely to be helped and hurt by inflation.

20. What is indexing?

21. Name several forms of indexing in the private and public sector.

  

1.  Describe a situation, either a government policy situation, an
    economic problem, or a private sector situation, where using the GDP
    deflator to convert from nominal to real would be more appropriate
    than using the CPI.

2.  Why do you think the U.S. experience with inflation over the last 50
    years has been so much milder than in many other countries?

3.  If, over time, wages and salaries on average rise at least as fast
    as inflation, why do people worry about how inflation affects
    incomes?

4.  Who in an economy is the big winner from inflation?

5.  If a government gains from unexpected inflation when it borrows, why
    would it choose to offer indexed bonds?

6.  Do you think perfect indexing is possible? Why or why not?

      

    PROBLEMS

7.  The index number representing the price level changes from 110 to
    115 in one year, and then from 115 to 120 the next year. Since the
    index number increases by five each year, is five the inflation rate
    each year? Is the inflation rate the same each year? Explain your
    answer.

8.  The total price of purchasing a basket of goods in the United
    Kingdom over four years is: year 1=£940, year 2=£970, year 3=£1000,
    and year 4=£1070. Calculate two price indices, one using year 1 as
    the base year (set equal to 100) and the other using year 4 as the
    base year (set equal to 100). Then, calculate the inflation rate
    based on the first price index. If you had used the other price
    index, would you get a different inflation rate? If you are unsure,
    do the calculation and find out.

9.  Within 1 or 2 percentage points, what has the U.S. inflation rate
    been during the last 20 years? Draw a graph to show the data.

      

10. If inflation rises unexpectedly by 5%, indicate for each of the
    following whether the economic actor is helped, hurt, or unaffected:

    1.  A union member with a COLA wage contract

    2.  Someone with a large stash of cash in a safe deposit box

    3.  A bank lending money at a fixed rate of interest

    4.  A person who is not due to receive a pay raise for another 11
        months

11. Rosalie the Retiree knows that when she retires in 16 years, her
    company will give her a one-time payment of $20,000. However, if the
    inflation rate is 6% per year, how much buying power will that
    $20,000 have when measured in today’s dollars? *Hint*: Start by
    calculating the rise in the price level over the 16 years.

More than Meets the Eye in the Congo

How much do you interact with the global financial system? Do you think
not much? Think again. Suppose you take out a student loan, or you
deposit money into your bank account. You just affected domestic savings
and borrowing. Now say you are at the mall and buy two T-shirts “made in
China,” and later contribute to a charity that helps refugees. What is
the impact? You affected how much money flows into and out of the United
States. If you open an IRA savings account and put money in an
international mutual fund, you are involved in the flow of money
overseas. While your involvement may not seem as influential as that of
someone like the president, who can increase or decrease foreign aid
and, thereby, have a huge impact on money flows in and out of the
country, you do interact with the global financial system on a daily
basis.

The balance of payments—a term you will meet soon—seems like a huge
topic, but once you learn the specific components of trade and money, it
all makes sense. Along the way, you may have to give up some common
misunderstandings about trade and answer some questions: If a country is
running a trade deficit, is that bad? Is a trade surplus good? For
example, look at the Democratic Republic of the Congo (often referred to
as “Congo”), a large country in Central Africa. In 2013, it ran a trade
surplus of $1 billion, so it must be doing well, right? In contrast, the
trade deficit in the United States was $508 billion in 2013. Do these
figures suggest that the United States economy is performing worse than
the Congolese economy? Not necessarily. The U.S. trade deficit tends to
worsen as the economy strengthens. In contrast, high poverty rates in
the Congo persist, and these rates are not going down even with the
positive trade balance. Clearly, it is more complicated than

  

simply asserting that running a trade deficit is bad for the economy.
You will learn more about these issues and others in this chapter.

  

#### Introduction to International Trade and Capital Flows

In this chapter, you will learn about:

-   Measuring Trade Balances

-   Trade Balances in Historical and International Context

-   Trade Balances and Flows of Financial Capital

-   The National Saving and Investment Identity

-   The Pros and Cons of Trade Deficits and Surpluses

-   The Difference between Level of Trade and the Trade Balance

  

<span id="bookmark781">The</span> **balance of trade**
<a href="#bookmark432" class="s34">(or trade balance) is any gap between a nation’s dollar value of its exports, or what its producers sell abroad, and a nation’s dollar value of imports, or the foreign-made products and services that households and businesses purchase. Recall from</a>
<a href="#bookmark432" class="a">The Macroeconomic Perspective</a><span
class="s54"> </span>that if exports exceed imports, the economy has a
trade surplus. If imports exceed exports, the economy has a trade
deficit. If exports and imports are equal, then trade is balanced, but
what happens when trade is out of balance and large trade surpluses or
deficits exist?<span id="bookmark782">‌</span>

Germany, for example, has had substantial trade surpluses in recent
decades, in which exports have greatly exceeded imports. According to
the Central Intelligence Agency’s The World Factbook, in 2016, Germany
ran a trade surplus of $295 billion. In contrast, the U.S. economy in
recent decades has experienced large trade deficits, in which imports
have considerably exceeded exports. In 2016, for example, U.S. imports
exceeded exports by $502 billion.

<span id="bookmark783">A series of financial crises triggered by
unbalanced trade can lead economies into deep recessions. These crises
begin with large trade deficits. At some point, foreign investors become
pessimistic about the economy and move their money to other countries.
The economy then drops into deep recession, with real GDP often falling
up to 10% or more in a single year. This happened to Mexico in 1995 when
their GDP fell 8.1%. A number of countries in East Asia—Thailand, South
Korea, Malaysia, and Indonesia—succumbed to the same economic illness in
1997–1998 (called the Asian Financial Crisis). In the late 1990s and
into the early 2000s, Russia and Argentina had the identical experience.
What are the connections between imbalances of trade in goods and
services and the flows of international financial capital that set off
these economic avalanches?</span>

We will start by examining the balance of trade in more detail, by
looking at some patterns of trade balances in the United States and
around the world. Then we will examine the intimate connection between
international flows of goods and services and international flows of
financial capital, which to economists are really just two sides of the
same coin. People often assume that trade surpluses like those in
Germany must be a positive sign for an economy, while trade deficits
like those in the United States must be harmful. As it turns out, both
trade surpluses and deficits can be either good or bad. We will see why
in this chapter.

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Explain merchandise trade balance, current account balance, and
        unilateral transfers

    -   Identify components of the U.S. current account balance

    -   Calculate the merchandise trade balance and current account
        balance using import and export data for a country

      

    A few decades ago, it was common to track the solid or physical
    items that planes, trains, and trucks transported between countries
    as a way of measuring the balance of trade. Economists call this
    measurement is called the

      

      

    <span id="bookmark785">merchandise trade balance</span><span
    class="p">. In most high-income economies, including the United
    States, goods comprise less than half of a country’s total
    production, while services comprise more than half. The last two
    decades have seen a surge in international trade in services,
    powered by technological advances in telecommunications and
    computers that have made it possible to export or import customer
    services, finance, law, advertising, management consulting,
    software, construction engineering, and product design. Most global
    trade still takes the form of goods rather than services, and the
    government announces and the media prominently report the
    merchandise trade balance. Old habits are hard to break. Economists,
    however, typically rely on broader measures such as the balance of
    trade or the </span>current account balance <span class="p">which
    includes other international flows of income and foreign
    aid.</span><span id="bookmark786">‌</span>

    Components of the U.S. Current Account Balance

    <a href="#bookmark787" class="a">Table 10.1</a> <span
    class="p">breaks down the four main components of the U.S. current
    account balance for the last quarter of 2015 (seasonally adjusted).
    The first line shows the merchandise trade balance; that is, exports
    and imports of goods. Because imports exceed exports, the trade
    balance in the final column is negative, showing a merchandise trade
    deficit. We can explain how the government collects this trade
    information in the following Clear It Up feature.</span>

    How does the U.S. government collect trade statistics?

    <span id="bookmark788">Do not confuse the balance of trade (which
    tracks imports and exports), with the current account balance, which
    includes not just exports and imports, but also income from
    investment and transfers.</span>

    <span id="bookmark789">The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) within
    the U.S. Department of Commerce compiles statistics on the balance
    of trade using a variety of different sources. Merchandise importers
    and exporters must file monthly documents with the Census Bureau,
    which provides the basic data for tracking trade. To measure
    international trade in services—which can happen over a telephone
    line or computer network without shipping any physical goods—the BEA
    carries out a set of surveys. Another set of BEA surveys tracks
    investment flows, and there are even specific surveys to collect
    travel information from U.S. residents visiting Canada and Mexico.
    For measuring unilateral transfers, the BEA has access to official
    U.S. government spending on aid, and then also carries out a survey
    of charitable organizations that make foreign donations.</span>

    The BEA then cross-checks this information on international flows of
    goods and capital against other available data. For example, the
    Census Bureau also collects data from the shipping industry, which
    it can use to check the data on trade in goods. All companies
    involved in international flows of capital—including banks

    Table 10.1 Components of the U.S. Current Account Balance for 2015
    (in billions)

      

      

    and companies making financial investments like stocks—must file
    reports, which the U.S. Department of the Treasury ultimately
    checks. The BEA also can cross check information on foreign trade by
    looking at data collected by other countries on their foreign trade
    with the United States, and also at the data collected by various
    international organizations. Take these data sources, stir
    carefully, and you have the U.S. balance of trade statistics. Much
    of the statistics that we cite in this chapter come from these
    sources.

      

    <a href="#bookmark787" id="bookmark790" class="s34">The second row of</a>
    <a href="#bookmark787" class="a">Table 10.1</a> <span
    class="p">provides data on trade in services. Here, the U.S. economy
    is running a surplus. Although the level of trade in services is
    still relatively small compared to trade in goods, the importance of
    services has expanded substantially over the last few decades. For
    example, U.S. exports of services were equal to about one- half of
    U.S. exports of goods in 2015, compared to one-fifth in 1980.</span>

    <span id="bookmark791">The third component of the current account
    balance, labeled “income payments,” refers to money that U.S.
    financial investors received on their foreign investments (money
    flowing into the United States) and payments to foreign investors
    who had invested their funds here (money flowing out of the United
    States). The reason for including this money on foreign investment
    in the overall measure of trade, along with goods and services, is
    that, from an economic perspective, income is just as much an
    economic transaction as car, wheat, or oil shipments: it is just
    trade that is happening in the financial capital market.</span>

    <span id="bookmark792">The final category of the current account
    balance is</span> **unilateral transfers**, which are payments that
    government, private charities, or individuals make in which they
    send money abroad without receiving any direct good or service.
    Economic or military assistance from the U.S. government to other
    countries fits into this category, as does spending abroad by
    charities to address poverty or social inequalities. When an
    individual in the United States sends money overseas, as is the case
    with some immigrants, it is also counted in this category. The
    current account balance treats these unilateral payments like
    imports, because they also involve a stream of payments leaving the
    country. For the

    U.S. economy, unilateral transfers are almost always negative. This
    pattern, however, does not always hold. In 1991, for example, when
    the United States led an international coalition against Saddam
    Hussein’s Iraq in the Gulf War, many other nations agreed that they
    would make payments to the United States to offset the U.S. war
    expenses. These payments were large enough that, in 1991, the
    overall U.S. balance on unilateral transfers was a positive $10
    billion.

    Known information:

    -   Unilateral transfers: $130

    -   Exports in goods: $1,046

    -   Exports in services: $509

    -   Imports in goods: $1,562

    -   Imports in services: $371

    -   Income received by U.S. investors on foreign stocks and bonds:
        $561

    -   Income received by foreign investors on U.S. assets: $472

    Step 1. Focus on goods and services first. Enter the dollar amount
    of exports of both goods and services under the Export column.

    Step 2. Enter imports of goods and services under the Import column.

    Step 3. Under the Export column and in the row for Income payments,
    enter the financial flows of money coming back to the United States.
    U.S. investors are earning this income from abroad.

    Step 4. Under the Import column and in the row for Income payments,
    enter the financial flows of money going out of the United States to
    foreign investors. Foreign investors are earning this money on U.S.
    assets, like stocks.

    Step 5. Unilateral transfers are money flowing out of the United
    States in the form of, for example, military aid, foreign aid, and
    global charities. Because the money leaves the country, enter it
    under Imports and in the final column as well, as a negative.

    Step 6. Calculate the trade balance by subtracting imports from
    exports in both goods and services. Enter this in the final Balance
    column. This can be positive or negative.

    Step 7. Subtract the income payments flowing out of the country
    (under Imports) from the money coming back to the United States
    (under Exports) and enter this amount under the Balance column.

    Step 8. Enter unilateral transfers as a negative amount under the
    Balance column.

    Step 9. The merchandise trade balance is the difference between
    exports of goods and imports of goods—the first number under
    Balance.

    Step 10. Now sum up your columns for Exports, Imports, and Balance.
    The final balance number is the current account balance.

    <a href="#bookmark794" class="s84">The merchandise balance of trade is the difference between exports and imports. In this case, it is equal to $1,046 – $1,562, a trade deficit of –$516 billion. The current account balance is –$419 billion. See the completed</a>

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Analyze graphs of the current account balance and the
        merchandise trade balance

    -   Identify patterns in U.S. trade surpluses and deficits

    -   Compare the U.S. trade surpluses and deficits to other
        countries' trade surpluses and deficits

    Merchandise Trade Balance, 1960–2015</span> <span class="s37">(a)
    The current account balance and the merchandise trade balance in
    billions of dollars from 1960 to 2015. If the lines are above zero
    dollars, the United States was running a positive trade balance and
    current account balance. If the lines fall below zero dollars, the
    United States is running a trade deficit and a deficit in its
    current account balance. (b) This shows the same items—trade balance
    and current account balance—in relationship to the size of the U.S.
    economy, or GDP, from 1960 to 2015.</span>

      

    <a href="#bookmark796" class="s34">By either measure, the U.S. balance of trade pattern is clear. From the 1960s into the 1970s, the U.S. economy had mostly small trade surpluses—that is, the graphs in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark796" class="a">Figure 10.2</a> <span
    class="p">show positive numbers. However, starting in the 1980s, the
    trade deficit increased rapidly, and after a tiny surplus in 1991,
    the current account trade deficit became even larger in the late
    1990s and into the mid-2000s. However, the trade deficit declined in
    2009 after the recession had taken hold, then rebounded partially in
    2010 and has remained stable up through 2016.</span>

      

      

    <a href="#bookmark798" id="bookmark797" class="a">Table 10.4</a><span
    class="s54"> </span>shows the U.S. trade picture in 2013 compared
    with some other economies from around the world. While the U.S.
    economy has consistently run trade deficits in recent years, Japan
    and many European nations, among them France and Germany, have
    consistently run trade surpluses. Some of the other countries listed
    include Brazil, the largest economy in Latin America; Nigeria, along
    with South Africa competing to be the largest economy in Africa; and
    China, India, and Korea. The first column offers one measure of an
    economy's globalization: **exports of goods and services as a
    percentage of GDP**. The second column shows the trade balance.
    Usually, most countries have trade surpluses or deficits that are
    less than 5% of GDP. As you can see, the U.S. current account
    balance is –2.6% of GDP, while Germany's is 8.4% of GDP.

    <span id="bookmark800">As economists see it, trade surpluses can be
    either good or bad, depending on circumstances, and trade deficits
    can be good or bad, too. The challenge is to understand how the
    international flows of goods and services are connected with
    international flows of</span> **financial capital**. In this module
    we will illustrate the intimate connection between trade balances
    and flows of financial capital in two ways: a parable of trade
    between Robinson Crusoe and Friday, and a circular flow diagram
    representing flows of trade and payments.

    A Two-Person Economy: Robinson Crusoe and Friday

    To understand how economists view trade deficits and surpluses,
    consider a parable based on the story of Robinson Crusoe. Crusoe, as
    you may remember from the classic novel by Daniel Defoe first
    published in 1719, was

      

      

    shipwrecked on a desert island. After living alone for some time, he
    is joined by a second person, whom he names Friday. Think about the
    balance of trade in a two-person economy like that of Robinson and
    Friday.

    Robinson and Friday trade goods and services. Perhaps Robinson
    catches fish and trades them to Friday for coconuts, or Friday
    weaves a hat out of tree fronds and trades it to Robinson for help
    in carrying water. For a period of time, each individual trade is
    self-contained and complete. Because each trade is voluntary, both
    Robinson and Friday must feel that they are receiving fair value for
    what they are giving. As a result, each person’s exports are always
    equal to his imports, and trade is always in balance between the
    two. Neither person experiences either a trade deficit or a trade
    surplus.

    However, one day Robinson approaches Friday with a proposition.
    Robinson wants to dig ditches for an irrigation system for his
    garden, but he knows that if he starts this project, he will not
    have much time left to fish and gather coconuts to feed himself each
    day. He proposes that Friday supply him with a certain number of
    fish and coconuts for several months, and then after that time, he
    promises to repay Friday out of the extra produce that he will be
    able to grow in his irrigated garden. If Friday accepts this offer,
    then a trade imbalance comes into being. For several months, Friday
    will have a trade surplus: that is, he is exporting to Robinson more
    than he is importing. More precisely, he is giving Robinson fish and
    coconuts, and at least for the moment, he is receiving nothing in
    return. Conversely, Robinson will have a trade deficit, because he
    is importing more from Friday than he is exporting.

    This parable raises several useful issues in thinking about what a
    trade deficit and a trade surplus really mean in economic terms. The
    first issue that this story of Robinson and Friday raises is this:
    Is it better to have a trade surplus or a trade deficit? The answer,
    as in any voluntary market interaction, is that if both parties
    agree to the transaction, then they may both be better off. Over
    time, if Robinson’s irrigated garden is a success, it is certainly
    possible that both Robinson and Friday can benefit from this
    agreement.

    The parable raises a second issue: What can go wrong? Robinson’s
    proposal to Friday introduces an element of uncertainty. Friday is,
    in effect, making a loan of fish and coconuts to Robinson, and
    Friday’s happiness with this arrangement will depend on whether
    Robinson repays that loan as planned, in full and on time. Perhaps
    Robinson spends several months loafing and never builds the
    irrigation system, or perhaps Robinson has been too optimistic about
    how much he will be able to grow with the new irrigation system,
    which turns out not to be very productive. Perhaps, after building
    the irrigation system, Robinson decides that he does not want to
    repay Friday as much as he previously agreed. Any of these
    developments will prompt a new round of negotiations between Friday
    and Robinson. Why the repayment failed is likely to shape Friday’s
    attitude toward these renegotiations. If Robinson worked very hard
    and the irrigation system just did not increase production as
    intended, Friday may have some sympathy. If Robinson loafed or if he
    just refuses to pay, Friday may become irritated.

    A third issue that the parable raises is that an intimate
    relationship exists between a trade deficit and international
    borrowing, and between a trade surplus and international lending.
    The size of Friday’s trade surplus is exactly how much he is lending
    to Robinson. The size of Robinson’s trade deficit is exactly how
    much he is borrowing from Friday. To economists, a trade surplus
    literally means the same thing as an outflow of financial capital,
    and a trade deficit literally means the same thing as an inflow of
    financial capital. This last insight is worth exploring in greater
    detail, which we will do in the following section.

    Table 10.5

      

    <a href="#bookmark802" class="s84">Step 1. Observe from</a>
    <a href="#bookmark802" class="s43">Table 10.5</a> <span
    class="s37">that, in the United States, it takes eight hours to
    supply a bushel of wheat and nine hours to supply a yard of cloth.
    In contrast, it takes four hours to supply a bushel of wheat and
    three hours to supply a yard of cloth in Britain.</span>

    Step 2. Recognize the difference between absolute advantage and
    comparative advantage. Britain has an absolute advantage (lowest
    cost) in each good, since it takes a lower amount of labor to make
    each good in Britain. Britain also has a comparative advantage in
    the production of cloth (lower opportunity cost in cloth (3/ 4
    versus 9/8)). The United States has a comparative advantage in wheat
    production (lower opportunity cost of 8/9 versus 4/3).

    Step 3. Determine the relative price of one good in terms of the
    other good. The price of wheat, in this example, is the amount of
    cloth you have to give up. To find this price, convert the hours per
    unit of wheat and cloth into units per hour. To do so, observe that
    in the United States it takes eight hours to make a bushel of wheat,
    so workers can process 1/8 of a bushel of wheat in an hour. It takes
    nine hours to make a yard of cloth in the United States, so workers
    can produce 1/9 of a yard of cloth in an hour. If you divide the
    amount of cloth (1/9 of a yard) by the amount of wheat you give up
    (1/8 of a bushel) in an hour, you find the price (8/9) of one good
    (wheat) in terms of the other (cloth).

      

    The Balance of Trade as the Balance of Payments

    <span id="bookmark803">The connection between trade balances and
    international flows of financial capital is so close that economists
    sometimes describe the balance of trade as the balance of payments.
    Each category of the current account balance involves a
    corresponding flow of payments between a given country and the rest
    of the world economy.</span>

    <a href="#bookmark805" class="a">Figure 10.3</a> <span
    class="p">shows the flow of goods and services and payments between
    one country—the United States in this example—and the rest of the
    world. The top line shows U.S. exports of goods and services, while
    the second line shows financial payments from purchasers in other
    countries back to the U.S. economy. The third line then shows</span>

    U.S. imports of goods, services, and investment, and the fourth line
    shows payments from the home economy to the rest of the world. Flow
    of goods and services (lines one and three) show up in the current
    account, while we find flow of funds (lines two and four) in the
    financial account.

    bottom lines, we see investments made abroad with funds flowing from
    the home country to the rest of the world. Investment income
    stemming from an investment abroad then runs in the other direction
    from the rest of the world to the home country. Similarly, we see on
    the bottom third line, an investment from the rest of the world into
    the home country and investment income (bottom fourth line) flowing
    from the home country to the rest of the world. We find the
    investment income (bottom lines two and four) in the current
    account, while investment to the rest of the world or into the home
    country (lines one and three) is in the financial account. This
    figure does not show unilateral transfers, the fourth item in the
    current account.</span>

      

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_233.jpg" width="467" height="264" alt="image" />

    <span id="bookmark805">Figure 10.3 Flow of Investment Goods and
    Capital</span> <span class="s37">Each element of the current account
    balance involves a flow of financial payments between countries. The
    top line shows exports of goods and services leaving the home
    country; the second line shows the money that the home country
    receives for those exports. The third line shows imports that the
    home country receives; the fourth line shows the payments that the
    home country sent abroad in exchange for these imports.</span>

      

    A current account deficit means that, the country is a net borrower
    from abroad. Conversely, a positive current account balance means a
    country is a net lender to the rest of the world. Just like the
    parable of Robinson and Friday, the lesson is that a trade surplus
    means an overall outflow of financial investment capital, as
    domestic investors put their funds abroad, while a deficit in the
    current account balance is exactly equal to the overall or net
    inflow of foreign investment capital from abroad.

    It is important to recognize that an inflow and outflow of foreign
    capital does not necessarily refer to a debt that governments owe to
    other governments, although government debt may be part of the
    picture. Instead, these international flows of financial capital
    refer to all of the ways in which private investors in one country
    may invest in another country—by buying real estate, companies, and
    financial investments like stocks and bonds.

      

4.  <span id="bookmark775">|</span> <span style=" color: #3767B1;">The
    National Saving and Investment Identity</span><span
    id="bookmark806">‌</span>

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Explain the determinants of trade and current account balance

    -   Identify and calculate supply and demand for financial capital

    -   Explain how a nation's own level of domestic saving and
        investment determines a nation's balance of trade

    -   Predict the rising and falling of trade deficits based on a
        nation's saving and investment identity

      

    The close connection between trade balances and international flows
    of savings and investments leads to a macroeconomic analysis. This
    approach views trade balances—and their associated flows of
    financial capital—in the context of the overall levels of savings
    and financial investment in the economy.

    Understanding the Determinants of the Trade and Current Account
    Balance

    <span id="bookmark807">The</span> **national saving and investment
    identity** provides a useful way to understand the determinants of
    the trade and current account balance. In a nation’s financial
    capital market, the quantity of financial capital supplied at any
    given time must equal the quantity of financial capital demanded for
    purposes of making investments. What is on the supply and demand
    sides of financial capital? See the following Clear It Up feature
    for the answer to this question.<span id="bookmark808">‌</span>

      

    What comprises the supply and demand of financial capital?

    A country’s national savings is the total of its domestic savings by
    household and companies (private savings) as well as the government
    (public savings). If a country is running a trade deficit, it means
    money from abroad is entering the country and the government
    considers it part of the supply of financial capital.

    The demand for financial capital (money) represents groups that are
    borrowing the money. Businesses need to borrow to finance their
    investments in factories, materials, and personnel. When the federal
    government runs a budget deficit, it is also borrowing money from
    investors by selling Treasury bonds. Therefore, both business
    investment and the federal government can demand (or borrow) the
    supply of savings.

      

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_234.png" width="624" height="51" alt="image" />

    There are two main sources for the supply of financial capital in
    the U.S. economy: saving by individuals and firms, called S, and the
    inflow of financial capital from foreign investors, which is equal
    to the trade deficit (M – X), or imports minus exports. There are
    also two main sources of demand for financial capital in the U.S.
    economy: private sector investment, I, and government borrowing,
    where the government needs to borrow when government spending, G, is
    higher than the taxes collected, T. We can express this national
    savings and investment identity in algebraic terms:

    Supply of financial capital = Demand for financial capital S + (M
    – X) = I + (G – T)

    Again, in this equation, S is private savings, T is taxes, G is
    government spending, M is imports, X is exports, and I is
    investment. This relationship is true as a matter of definition
    because, for the macro economy, the quantity supplied of financial
    capital must be equal to the quantity demanded.

    However, certain components of the national savings and investment
    identity can switch between the supply side and the demand side.
    Some countries, like the United States in most years since the
    1970s, have budget deficits, which mean the government is spending
    more than it collects in taxes, and so the government needs to
    borrow funds. In this case, the government term would be G – T &gt;
    0, showing that spending is larger than taxes, and the government
    would be a demander of financial capital on the left-hand side of
    the equation (that is, a borrower), not a supplier of financial
    capital on the right-hand side. However, if the government runs a
    budget surplus so that the taxes exceed spending, as the U.S.
    government did from 1998 to 2001, then the government in that year
    was contributing to the supply of financial capital (T – G &gt; 0),
    and would appear on the left (saving) side of the national savings
    and investment identity.

    Similarly, if a national economy runs a trade surplus, the trade
    sector will involve an outflow of financial capital to other
    countries. A trade surplus means that the domestic financial capital
    is in surplus within a country and can be invested in other
    countries.

    <span id="bookmark809">The fundamental notion that total quantity of
    financial capital demanded equals total quantity of financial
    capital supplied must always remain true. Domestic savings will
    always appear as part of the supply of financial capital and
    domestic investment will always appear as part of the demand for
    financial capital. However, the government and trade balance
    elements of the equation can move back and forth as either suppliers
    or demanders of financial capital, depending on whether government
    budgets and the trade balance are in surplus or deficit.</span>

    Domestic Saving and Investment Determine the Trade Balance

    One insight from the national saving and investment identity is that
    a nation's own levels of domestic saving and investment determine a
    nation’s balance of trade. To understand this point, rearrange the
    identity to put the balance of trade all by itself on one side of
    the equation. Consider first the situation with a trade deficit, and
    then the situation with a trade surplus.

    In the case of a trade deficit, the national saving and investment
    identity can be rewritten as:

    Trade deficit = Domestic investment – Private domestic saving –
    Government (or public) savings (M – X) = I – S – (T – G)

    In this case, domestic investment is higher than domestic saving,
    including both private and government saving. The

      

      

    only way that domestic investment can exceed domestic saving is if
    capital is flowing into a country from abroad. After all, that extra
    financial capital for investment has to come from someplace.

    Now consider a trade *surplus* from the standpoint of the national
    saving and investment identity:

    Trade surplus = Private domestic saving + Public saving – Domestic
    investment (X – M) = S + (T – G) – I

    In this case, domestic savings (both private and public) is higher
    than domestic investment. That extra financial capital will be
    invested abroad.

    <a href="#bookmark1659" class="s34">This connection of domestic saving and investment to the trade balance explains why economists view the balance of trade as a fundamentally macroeconomic phenomenon. As the national saving and investment identity shows, the performance of certain sectors of an economy, like cars or steel, do not determine the trade balance. Further, whether the nation’s trade laws and regulations encourage free trade or protectionism also does not determine the trade balance (see</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1659" class="a">Globalization and</a>
    Protectionism<span class="p">).</span>

    Exploring Trade Balances One Factor at a Time

    The national saving and investment identity also provides a
    framework for thinking about what will cause trade deficits to rise
    or fall. Begin with the version of the identity that has domestic
    savings and investment on the left and the trade deficit on the
    right:

    Domestic investment – Private domestic savings – Public domestic
    savings = Trade deficit

    I – S – (T – G) = (M – X)

    Now, consider the factors on the left-hand side of the equation one
    at a time, while holding the other factors constant.

    <a href="#bookmark810" class="s34">As a first example, assume that the level of domestic investment in a country rises, while the level of private and public saving remains unchanged.</a>
    <a href="#bookmark810" class="a">Table 10.6</a> <span
    class="p">shows the result in the first row under the equation.
    Since the equality of the national savings and investment identity
    must continue to hold—it is, after all, an identity that must be
    true by definition—the rise in domestic investment will mean a
    higher trade deficit. This situation occurred in the U.S. economy in
    the late 1990s. Because of the surge of new information and
    communications technologies that became available, business
    investment increased substantially. A fall in private saving during
    this time and a rise in government saving more or less offset each
    other. As a result, the financial capital to fund that business
    investment came from abroad, which is one reason for the very high
    U.S. trade deficits of the late 1990s and early 2000s.</span>

    Table 10.6 Causes of a Changing Trade Balance

      

    As a second scenario, assume that the level of domestic savings
    rises, while the level of domestic investment and public savings
    remain unchanged. In this case, the trade deficit would decline. As
    domestic savings rises, there would be less need for foreign
    financial capital to meet investment needs. For this reason, a
    policy proposal often made for reducing the U.S. trade deficit is to
    increase private saving—although exactly how to increase the overall
    rate of saving has proven controversial.

    As a third scenario, imagine that the government budget deficit
    increased dramatically, while domestic investment

      

      

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_235.png" width="624" height="625" alt="image" />

    and private savings remained unchanged. This scenario occurred in
    the U.S. economy in the mid-1980s. The federal budget deficit
    increased from $79 billion in 1981 to $221 billion in 1986—an
    increase in the demand for financial capital of $142 billion. The
    current account balance collapsed from a surplus of $5 billion in
    1981 to a deficit of $147 billion in 1986—an increase in the supply
    of financial capital from abroad of $152 billion. The connection at
    that time is clear: a sharp increase in government borrowing
    increased the U.S. economy’s demand for financial capital, and
    foreign investors through the trade deficit primarily supplied that
    increase. The following Work It Out feature walks you through a
    scenario in which private domestic savings has to rise by a certain
    amount to reduce a trade deficit.

      

    Solving Problems with the Saving and Investment Identity

    Use the saving and investment identity to answer the following
    question: Country A has a trade deficit of $200 billion, private
    domestic savings of $500 billion, a government deficit of $200
    billion, and private domestic investment of $500 billion. To reduce
    the $200 billion trade deficit by $100 billion, by how much does
    private domestic savings have to increase?

    Step 1. Write out the savings investment formula solving for the
    trade deficit or surplus on the left:

    (X – M) = S + (T – G) – I

    Step 2. In the formula, put the amount for the trade deficit in as a
    negative number (X – M). The left side of your formula is now:

    –200 = S + (T – G) – I

    Step 3. Enter the private domestic savings (S) of $500 in the
    formula:

    –200 = 500 + (T – G) – I

    Step 4. Enter the private domestic investment (I) of $500 into the
    formula:

    –200 = 500+ (T – G) – 500

    Step 5. The government budget surplus or balance is represented by
    (T – G). Enter a budget deficit amount for (T – G) of –200:

      

    Step 6. Your formula now is:

    –200 = 500 + (–200) – 500

      

    (X – M) = S + (T – G) – I

    –200 = 500 + (–200) – 500

      

    The question is: To reduce your trade deficit (X – M) of –200 to
    –100 (in billions of dollars), by how much will savings have to
    rise?

    (X – M) = S + (T – G) – I

    –100 = S + (–200) – 500

    600 = S

    Step 7. Summarize the answer: Private domestic savings needs to rise
    by $100 billion, to a total of $600 billion, for the two sides of
    the equation to remain equal (–100 = –100).

      

    Short-Term Movements in the Business Cycle and the Trade Balance

    In the short run, whether an economy is in a recession or on the
    upswing can affect trade imbalances. A recession tends to make a
    trade deficit smaller, or a trade surplus larger, while a period of
    strong economic growth tends to make a trade deficit larger, or a
    trade surplus smaller.

    <a href="#bookmark796" class="s34">As an example, note in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark796" class="a">Figure 10.2</a> <span
    class="p">that the U.S. trade deficit declined by almost half from
    2006 to 2009. One primary reason for this change is that during the
    recession, as the U.S. economy slowed down, it purchased fewer of
    all goods, including fewer imports from abroad. However, buying
    power abroad fell less, and so U.S. exports did not</span>

      

      

    fall by as much.

    Conversely, in the mid-2000s, when the U.S. trade deficit became
    very large, a contributing short-term reason is that the U.S.
    economy was growing. As a result, there was considerable aggressive
    buying in the U.S. economy, including the buying of imports. Thus, a
    trade deficit (or a much lower trade surplus) often accompanies a
    rapidly growing domestic economy, while a trade surplus (or a much
    lower trade deficit) accompanies a slowing or recessionary domestic
    economy.

    <span id="bookmark811">When the trade deficit rises, it necessarily
    means a greater net inflow of foreign financial capital. The
    national saving and investment identity teaches that the rest of the
    economy can absorb this inflow of foreign financial capital in
    several different ways. For example, reduced private savings could
    offset the additional inflow of financial capital from abroad,
    leaving domestic investment and public saving unchanged.
    Alternatively, the inflow of foreign financial capital could result
    in higher domestic investment, leaving private and public saving
    unchanged. Yet another possibility is that greater government
    borrowing could absorb the inflow of foreign financial capital,
    leaving domestic saving and investment unchanged. The national
    saving and investment identity does not specify which of these
    scenarios, alone or in combination, will occur—only that one of them
    must occur.</span>

    Pros and Cons of Trade Deficits and Surpluses</span><span
    id="bookmark812">‌</span>

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Identify three ways in which borrowing money or running a trade
        deficit can result in a healthy economy

    -   Identify three ways in which borrowing money or running a trade
        deficit can result in a weaker economy

      

    Because flows of trade always involve flows of financial payments,
    flows of international trade are actually the same as flows of
    international financial capital. The question of whether trade
    deficits or surpluses are good or bad for an economy is, in economic
    terms, exactly the same question as whether it is a good idea for an
    economy to rely on net inflows of financial capital from abroad or
    to make net investments of financial capital abroad. Conventional
    wisdom often holds that borrowing money is foolhardy, and that a
    prudent country, like a prudent person, should always rely on its
    own resources. While it is certainly possible to borrow too much—as
    anyone with an overloaded credit card can testify—borrowing at
    certain times can also make sound economic sense. For both
    individuals and countries, there is no economic merit in a policy of
    abstaining from participation in financial capital markets.

    It makes economic sense to borrow when you are buying something with
    a long-run payoff; that is, when you are making an investment. For
    this reason, it can make economic sense to borrow for a college
    education, because the education will typically allow you to earn
    higher wages, and so to repay the loan and still come out ahead. It
    can also make sense for a business to borrow in order to purchase a
    machine that will last 10 years, as long as the machine will
    increase output and profits by more than enough to repay the loan.
    Similarly, it can make economic sense for a national economy to
    borrow from abroad, as long as it wisely invests the money in ways
    that will tend to raise the nation’s economic growth over time.
    Then, it will be possible for the national economy to repay the
    borrowed money over time and still end up better off than before.

    One vivid example of a country that borrowed heavily from abroad,
    invested wisely, and did perfectly well is the United States during
    the nineteenth century. The United States ran a trade deficit in 40
    of the 45 years from 1831 to 1875, which meant that it was importing
    capital from abroad over that time. However, that financial capital
    was mostly invested in projects like railroads that brought a
    substantial economic payoff. (See the following Clear It Up feature
    for more on this.)

    A more recent example along these lines is the experience of South
    Korea, which had trade deficits during much of the 1970s—and so was
    an importer of capital over that time. However, South Korea also had
    high rates of investment in physical plant and equipment, and its
    economy grew rapidly. From the mid-1980s into the mid-1990s, South
    Korea often had trade surpluses—that is, it was repaying its past
    borrowing by sending capital abroad.

    In contrast, some countries have run large trade deficits, borrowed
    heavily in global capital markets, and ended up in all kinds of
    trouble. Two specific sorts of trouble are worth examining. First, a
    borrower nation can find itself in a bind if it does not invest the
    incoming funds from abroad in a way that leads to increased
    productivity. Several of

    Are trade deficits always harmful?

    For most years of the nineteenth century, U.S. imports exceeded
    exports and the U.S. economy had a trade deficit. Yet the string of
    trade deficits did not hold back the economy at all. Instead, the
    trade deficits contributed to the strong economic growth that gave
    the U.S. economy the highest per capita GDP in the world by
    around 1900.

    The U.S. trade deficits meant that the U.S. economy was receiving a
    net inflow of foreign capital from abroad. Much of that foreign
    capital flowed into two areas of investment—railroads and public
    infrastructure like roads, water systems, and schools—which were
    important to helping the U.S. economy grow.

    We should not overstate the effect of foreign investment capital on
    U.S. economic growth. In most years the foreign financial capital
    represented no more than 6–10% of the funds that the government used
    for overall physical investment in the economy. Nonetheless, the
    trade deficit and the accompanying investment funds from abroad were
    clearly a help, not a hindrance, to the U.S. economy in the
    nineteenth century.

    Latin America's large economies, including Mexico and Brazil, ran
    large trade deficits and borrowed heavily from abroad in the 1970s,
    but the inflow of financial capital did not boost productivity
    sufficiently, which meant that these countries faced enormous
    troubles repaying the money borrowed when economic conditions
    shifted during the 1980s. Similarly, it appears that a number of
    African nations that borrowed foreign funds in the 1970s and 1980s
    did not invest in productive economic assets. As a result, several
    of those countries later faced large interest payments, with no
    economic growth to show for the borrowed funds.

      

      

    <a href="#bookmark1483" id="bookmark813" class="s34">A second “trouble” is: What happens if the foreign money flows in, and then suddenly flows out again? We raised this scenario at the start of the chapter. In the mid-1990s, a number of countries in East Asia—Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, and South Korea—ran large trade deficits and imported capital from abroad. However, in 1997 and 1998 many foreign investors became concerned about the health of these economies, and quickly pulled their money out of stock and bond markets, real estate, and banks. The extremely rapid departure of that foreign capital staggered the banking systems and economies of these countries, plunging them into deep recession.

    the economy.</span>

    While a trade deficit is not always harmful, there is no guarantee
    that running a trade surplus will bring robust economic health. For
    example, Germany and Japan ran substantial trade surpluses for most
    of the last three decades. Regardless of their persistent trade
    surpluses, both countries have experienced occasional recessions and
    neither country has had especially robust annual growth in recent
    years. Read more about Japan’s trade surplus in the next Clear It Up
    feature.

      

      

      

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_238.png" width="624" height="51" alt="image" />

    Are trade surpluses always beneficial? Considering Japan since the
    1990s.

    Perhaps no economy around the world is better known for its trade
    surpluses than Japan. Since 1990, the size of these surpluses has
    often been near $100 billion per year. When Japan’s economy was
    growing vigorously in the 1960s and 1970s, many, especially
    non-economists, described its large trade surpluses either a cause
    or a result of its robust economic health. However, from a
    standpoint of economic growth, Japan’s economy has been teetering in
    and out of recession since 1990, with real GDP growth averaging only
    about 1% per year, and an unemployment rate that has been creeping
    higher. Clearly, a whopping trade surplus is no guarantee of
    economic good health.

    Instead, Japan’s trade surplus reflects that Japan has a very high
    rate of domestic savings, more than the Japanese economy can invest
    domestically, and so it invests the extra funds abroad. In Japan’s
    slow economy, consumption of imports is relatively low, and the
    growth of consumption is relatively slow. Thus, Japan’s exports
    continually exceed its imports, leaving the trade surplus
    continually high. Recently, Japan’s trade surpluses began to
    deteriorate. In 2013, Japan ran a trade deficit due to the high cost
    of imported oil. By 2015, Japan again had a surplus.

    The sheer size and persistence of the U.S. trade deficits and
    inflows of foreign capital since the 1980s are a legitimate cause
    for concern. The huge U.S. economy will not be destabilized by an
    outflow of international capital as easily as, say, the
    comparatively tiny economies of Thailand and Indonesia were in
    1997–1998. Even an economy that is not knocked down, however, can
    still be shaken. American policymakers should certainly be paying
    attention to those cases where a pattern of extensive and sustained
    current account deficits and foreign borrowing has gone badly—if
    only as a cautionary tale.

    Difference between Level of Trade and the Trade Balance</span><span
    id="bookmark814">‌</span><span id="bookmark815">‌</span>

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Identify three factors that influence a country's level of trade

    -   Differentiate between balance of trade and level of trade

      

    <span id="bookmark816">A nation’s</span> *level* of trade may at
    first sound like much the same issue as the *balance*
    <a href="#bookmark784" class="s34">of trade, but these two are actually quite separate. It is perfectly possible for a country to have a very high level of trade—measured by its exports of goods and services as a share of its GDP—while it also has a near-balance between exports and imports. A high level of trade indicates that the nation exports a good portion of its production. It is also possible for a country’s trade to be a relatively low share of GDP, relative to global averages, but for the imbalance between its exports and its imports to be quite large. We emphasized this general theme earlier in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark784" class="a">Measuring Trade</a> <span
    class="s54">Balances</span>, which offered some illustrative figures
    on trade levels and balances.

    A country’s level of trade tells how much of its production it
    exports. We measure this by the percent of exports out of GDP. It
    indicates the degree of an economy's globalization. Some countries,
    such as Germany, have a high level of trade—they export almost 50%
    of their total production. The balance of trade tells us if the
    country is running a trade surplus or trade deficit. A country can
    have a low level of trade but a high trade deficit. (For example,
    the United States only exports 13% of GDP, but it has a trade
    deficit of over $500 billion.)

    Three factors strongly influence a nation’s level of trade: the size
    of its economy, its geographic location, and its history of trade.
    Large economies like the United States can do much of their trading
    internally, while small economies like Sweden have less ability to
    provide what they want internally and tend to have higher ratios of
    exports and imports to GDP. Nations that are neighbors tend to trade
    more, since costs of transportation and communication

      

      

    are lower. Moreover, some nations have long and established patterns
    of international trade, while others do not.

    Consequently, a relatively small economy like Sweden, with many
    nearby trading partners across Europe and a long history of foreign
    trade, has a high level of trade. Brazil and India, which are fairly
    large economies that have often sought to inhibit trade in recent
    decades, have lower levels of trade; whereas, the United States and
    Japan are extremely large economies that have comparatively few
    nearby trading partners. Both countries actually have quite low
    levels of trade by world standards. The ratio of exports to GDP in
    either the United States or in Japan is about half of the world
    average.

    <span id="bookmark817">The balance of trade is a separate issue from
    the level of trade. The United States has a low level of trade, but
    had enormous trade deficits for most years from the mid-1980s into
    the 2000s. Japan has a low level of trade by world standards, but
    has typically shown large trade surpluses in recent decades. Nations
    like Germany and the United Kingdom have medium to high levels of
    trade by world standards, but Germany had a moderate trade surplus
    in 2015, while the United Kingdom had a moderate trade deficit.
    Their trade picture was roughly in balance in the late 1990s. Sweden
    had a high level of trade and a moderate trade surplus in 2015,
    while Mexico had a high level of trade and a moderate trade deficit
    that same year.</span>

    Are trade surpluses always beneficial? Considering Colonial India.

    India was formally under British rule from 1858 to 1947. During that
    time, India consistently had trade surpluses with Great Britain.
    Anyone who believes that trade surpluses are a sign of economic
    strength and dominance while trade deficits are a sign of economic
    weakness must find this pattern odd, since it would mean that
    colonial India was successfully dominating and exploiting Great
    Britain for almost a century—which was not true.

    Instead, India’s trade surpluses with Great Britain meant that each
    year there was an overall flow of financial capital from India to
    Great Britain. In India, many heavily criticized this financial
    capital flow as the “drain,” and they viewed eliminating the
    financial capital drain as one of the many reasons why India would
    benefit from achieving independence.

    In short, it is quite possible for nations with a relatively low
    level of trade, expressed as a percentage of GDP, to have relatively
    large trade deficits. It is also quite possible for nations with a
    near balance between exports and imports to worry about the
    consequences of high levels of trade for the economy. It is not
    inconsistent to believe that a high level of trade is potentially
    beneficial to an economy, because of the way it allows nations to
    play to their comparative advantages, and to also be concerned about
    any macroeconomic instability caused by a long-term pattern of large
    trade deficits. The following Clear It Up feature discusses how this
    sort of dynamic played out in Colonial India.

      

      

    Final Thoughts about Trade Balances

    Trade deficits can be a good or a bad sign for an economy, and trade
    surpluses can be a good or a bad sign. Even a trade balance of
    zero—which just means that a nation is neither a net borrower nor
    lender in the international economy—can be either a good or bad
    sign. The fundamental economic question is not whether a nation’s
    economy is borrowing or lending at all, but whether the particular
    borrowing or lending in the particular economic conditions of that
    country makes sense.

    It is interesting to reflect on how public attitudes toward trade
    deficits and surpluses might change if we could somehow change the
    labels that people and the news media affix to them. If we called a
    trade deficit “attracting foreign financial capital”—which
    accurately describes what a trade deficit means—then trade deficits
    might look more attractive. Conversely, if we called a trade surplus
    “shipping financial capital abroad”—which accurately captures what a
    trade surplus does—then trade surpluses might look less attractive.
    Either way, the key to understanding trade balances is to understand
    the relationships between flows of trade and flows of international
    payments, and what these relationships imply about the causes,
    benefits, and risks of different kinds of trade balances. The first
    step along this journey of understanding is to move beyond knee-jerk
    reactions to terms like “trade surplus,”

    More than Meets the Eye in the Congo

    Now that you see the big picture, you undoubtedly realize that all
    of the economic choices you make, such as depositing savings or
    investing in an international mutual fund, do influence the flow of
    goods and services as well as the flows of money around the world.

    You now know that a trade surplus does not necessarily tell us
    whether an economy is performing well or not. The Democratic
    Republic of the Congo ran a trade surplus in 2013, as we learned in
    the beginning of the chapter. Yet its current account balance was
    –$2.8 billion. However, the return of political stability and the
    rebuilding in the aftermath of the civil war there has meant a flow
    of investment and financial capital into the country. In this case,
    a negative current account balance means the country is being
    rebuilt—and that is a good thing.

    “trade balance,” and “trade deficit.”

    KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY

      

    1.  <a href="#bookmark784" class="a">Measuring Trade</a>
        [Balances](#bookmark784)

        The trade balance measures the gap between a country’s exports
        and its imports. In most high-income economies, goods comprise
        less than half of a country’s total production, while services
        comprise more than half. The last two decades have seen a surge
        in international trade in services; however, most global trade
        still takes the form of goods rather than services. The current
        account balance includes the trade in goods, services, and money
        flowing into and out of a country from investments and
        unilateral transfers.

          

    2.  <a href="#bookmark795" class="a">Trade Balances in Historical and International</a>
        [Context](#bookmark795)

        The United States developed large trade surpluses in the early
        1980s, swung back to a tiny trade surplus in 1991, and then had
        even larger trade deficits in the late 1990s and early 2000s. As
        we will see below, a trade deficit necessarily means a net
        inflow of financial capital from abroad, while a trade surplus
        necessarily means a net outflow of financial capital from an
        economy to other countries.

          

    3.  <a href="#bookmark799" class="a">Trade Balances and Flows of Financial</a>
        [Capital](#bookmark799)

        International flows of goods and services are closely connected
        to the international flows of financial capital. A current
        account deficit means that, after taking all the flows of
        payments from goods, services, and income together, the country
        is a net borrower from the rest of the world. A current account
        surplus is the opposite and means the country is a net lender to
        the rest of the world.

          

    4.  <a href="#bookmark806" class="a">The National Saving and Investment</a>
        [Identity](#bookmark806)

        The national saving and investment identity is based on the
        relationship that the total quantity of financial capital
        supplied from all sources must equal the total quantity of
        financial capital demanded from all sources. If S is private
        saving, T is taxes, G is government spending, M is imports, X is
        exports, and I is investment, then for an economy with a current
        account deficit and a budget deficit:

        Supply of financial capital = Demand for financial capital S +
        (M – X) = I + (G – T)

        A recession tends to increase the trade balance (meaning a
        higher trade surplus or lower trade deficit), while economic
        boom will tend to decrease the trade balance (meaning a lower
        trade surplus or a larger trade deficit).

          

    5.  <a href="#bookmark812" class="a">The Pros and Cons of Trade Deficits and</a>
        [Surpluses](#bookmark812)

        Trade surpluses are no guarantee of economic health, and trade
        deficits are no guarantee of economic weakness. Either trade
        deficits or trade surpluses can work out well or poorly,
        depending on whether a government wisely invests the
        corresponding flows of financial capital.

          

    6.  <a href="#bookmark814" class="a">The Difference between Level of Trade and the Trade</a>
        [Balance](#bookmark814)

There is a difference between the level of a country’s trade and the
balance of trade. The government measures its level of trade by the
percentage of exports out of GDP, or the size of the economy. Small
economies that have nearby trading partners and a history of
international trade will tend to have higher levels of trade. Larger
economies with few nearby trading partners and a limited history of
international trade will tend to have lower levels of trade. The level
of trade is different from the trade balance. The level of trade depends
on a country’s history of trade, its geography, and the size of its
economy. A country’s balance of trade is the dollar difference between
its exports and imports.

Trade deficits and trade surpluses are not necessarily good or bad—it
depends on the circumstances. Even if a country is borrowing, if it
invests that money in productivity-boosting investments it can lead to
an improvement in long-term economic growth.

    CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS

      

32. Occasionally, a government official will argue that a country should
    strive for both a trade surplus and a healthy inflow of capital from
    abroad. Explain why such a statement is economically impossible.

33. A government official announces a new policy. The country wishes to
    eliminate its trade deficit, but will strongly encourage financial
    investment from foreign firms. Explain why such a statement is
    contradictory.

34. If a country is a big exporter, is it more exposed to global
    financial crises?

35. If countries reduced trade barriers, would the international flows
    of money increase?

36. Is it better for your country to be an international lender or
    borrower?

37. Many think that the size of a trade deficit is due to a lack of
    competitiveness of domestic sectors, such as autos. Explain why this
    is not true.

38. If you observed a country with a rapidly growing trade surplus over
    a period of a year or so, would you be more likely to believe that
    the country's economy was in a period of recession or of rapid
    growth? Explain.

39. Occasionally, a government official will argue that a country should
    strive for both a trade surplus and a healthy inflow of capital from
    abroad. Is this possible?

40. What is more important, a country’s current account balance or GDP
    growth? Why?

41. Will nations that are more involved in foreign trade tend to have
    higher trade imbalances, lower trade imbalances, or is the pattern
    unpredictable?

42. Some economists warn that the persistent trade deficits and a
    negative current account balance that the United States has run will
    be a problem in the long run. Do you agree or not? Explain your
    answer.

      

    PROBLEMS

43. In 2001, the United Kingdom's economy exported goods worth £192
    billion and services worth another

    £77 billion. It imported goods worth £225 billion and services worth
    £66 billion. Receipts of income from abroad were £140 billion while
    income payments going abroad were £131 billion. Government transfers
    from the United Kingdom to the rest of the world were £23 billion,
    while various U.K government agencies received payments of £16
    billion from the rest of the world.

    1.  Calculate the U.K. merchandise trade deficit for 2001.

    2.  Calculate the current account balance for 2001.

    3.  Explain how you decided whether payments on foreign investment
        and government transfers counted on the positive or the negative
        side of the current account balance for the United Kingdom
        in 2001.

          

44. Imagine that the U.S. economy finds itself in the following
    situation: a government budget deficit of $100 billion, total
    domestic savings of $1,500 billion, and total domestic physical
    capital investment of $1,600 billion. According to the national
    saving and investment identity, what will be the current account
    balance? What will be the current account balance if investment
    rises by

    $50 billion, while the budget deficit and national savings remain
    the same?

From Housing Bubble to Housing Bust

<a href="#bookmark857" class="s84">The United States experienced rising home ownership rates for most of the last two decades. Between 1990 and 2006, the U.S. housing market grew. Homeownership rates grew from 64% to a high of over 69% between 2004 and 2005. For many people, this was a period in which they could either buy first homes or buy a larger and more expensive home. During this time mortgage values tripled. Housing became more accessible to Americans and was considered to be a safe financial investment.</a>

<span id="bookmark857">Figure 11.2 New Single Family Houses Sold</span>
<span class="s37">From the early 1990s up through 2005, the number of
new single family houses sold rose steadily. In 2006, the number dropped
dramatically and this dramatic decline continued through 2011. By 2014,
the number of new houses sold had begun to climb back up, but the levels
are still lower than those of 1990. (Source: U.S. Census Bureau)</span>

  

The housing bubble began to show signs of bursting in 2005, as
delinquency and late payments began to grow and an oversupply of new
homes on the market became apparent. Dropping home values contributed to
a decrease in the overall wealth of the household sector and caused
homeowners to pull back on spending. Several mortgage lenders were
forced to file for bankruptcy because homeowners were not making their
payments, and by 2008 the problem had spread throughout the financial
markets. Lenders clamped down on credit and the housing bubble burst.
Financial markets were now in crisis and unable or unwilling to even
extend credit to credit-worthy customers.

The housing bubble and the crisis in the financial markets were major
contributors to the Great Recession that led to unemployment rates over
10% and falling GDP. While the United States is still recovering from
the impact of the Great Recession, it has made substantial progress in
restoring financial market stability through implementing aggressive
fiscal and monetary policy.

The economic history of the United States is cyclical in nature with
recessions and expansions. Some of these fluctuations are severe, such
as the economic downturn that occurred during the Great Depression in
the 1930s which lasted several years. Why does the economy grow at
different rates in different years? What are the causes of the cyclical
behavior of the economy? This chapter will introduce an important model,
the aggregate demand–aggregate supply model, to begin our understanding
of why economies expand and contract over time.

  

#### Introduction to the Aggregate Supply–Aggregate Demand Model

In this chapter, you will learn about:

-   Macroeconomic Perspectives on Demand and Supply

-   Building a Model of Aggregate Supply and Aggregate Demand

-   Shifts in Aggregate Supply

-   Shifts in Aggregate Demand

-   How the AS–AD Model Incorporates Growth, Unemployment, and Inflation

-   Keynes’ Law and Say’s Law in the AS–AD Model

  

<span id="bookmark858">A key part of macroeconomics is the use of models
to analyze macro issues and problems. How is the rate of economic growth
connected to changes in the unemployment rate? Is there a reason why
unemployment and inflation seem to move in opposite directions: lower
unemployment and higher inflation from 1997 to 2000, higher unemployment
and lower inflation in the early 2000s, lower unemployment and higher
inflation in the mid-2000s,</span><span id="bookmark859">‌</span>

  

  

and then higher unemployment and lower inflation in 2009? Why did the
current account deficit rise so high, but then decline in 2009?

<a href="#bookmark952" id="bookmark860" class="s34">To analyze questions like these, we must move beyond discussing macroeconomic issues one at a time, and begin building economic models that will capture the relationships and interconnections between them. The next three chapters take up this task. This chapter introduces the macroeconomic model of aggregate supply and aggregate demand, how the two interact to reach a macroeconomic equilibrium, and how shifts in aggregate demand or aggregate supply will affect that equilibrium. This chapter also relates the model of aggregate supply and aggregate demand to the three goals of economic policy (growth, unemployment, and inflation), and provides a framework for thinking about many of the connections and tradeoffs between these goals. The chapter on</a>
<a href="#bookmark952" class="a">The Keynesian Perspective</a>
<a href="#bookmark1018" class="s34">focuses on the macroeconomy in the short run, where aggregate demand plays a crucial role. The chapter on</a>
<a href="#bookmark1018" class="a">The Neoclassical Perspective</a> <span
class="p">explores the macroeconomy in the long run, where aggregate
supply plays a crucial role.</span>

    style=" color: #3767B1;">Macroeconomic Perspectives on Demand and
    Supply</span><span id="bookmark861">‌</span>

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Explain Say’s Law and understand why it primarily applies in the
        long run

    -   Explain Keynes’ Law and understand why it primarily applies in
        the short run

      

    Macroeconomists over the last two centuries have often divided into
    two groups: those who argue that supply is the most important
    determinant of the size of the macroeconomy while demand just tags
    along, and those who argue that demand is the most important factor
    in the size of the macroeconomy while supply just tags along.

    Say’s Law and the Macroeconomics of Supply

    <span id="bookmark862">Those economists who emphasize the role of
    supply in the macroeconomy often refer to the work of a famous early
    nineteenth century French economist named Jean-Baptiste Say
    (1767–1832).</span> **Say’s law** is: “Supply creates its own
    demand.” As a matter of historical accuracy, it seems clear that Say
    never actually wrote down this law and that it oversimplifies his
    beliefs, but the law lives on as useful shorthand for summarizing a
    point of view.

    <span id="bookmark863">The intuition behind Say’s law is that each
    time a good or service is produced and sold, it generates income
    that is earned for someone: a worker, a manager, an owner, or those
    who are workers, managers, and owners at firms that supply inputs
    along the chain of production. We alluded to this earlier in our
    discussion of the National Income approach to measuring GDP. The
    forces of supply and demand in individual markets will cause prices
    to rise and fall. The bottom line remains, however, that every sale
    represents income to someone, and so, Say’s law argues, a given
    value of supply must create an equivalent value of demand somewhere
    else in the economy. Because Jean-Baptiste Say, Adam Smith, and
    other economists writing around the turn of the nineteenth century
    who discussed this view were known as “classical” economists, modern
    economists who generally subscribe to the Say’s law view on the
    importance of supply for determining the size of the macroeconomy
    are called</span> **neoclassical economists**.<span
    id="bookmark864">‌</span>

    <span id="bookmark865">If supply always creates exactly enough
    demand at the macroeconomic level, then (as Say himself recognized)
    it is hard to understand why periods of recession and high
    unemployment should ever occur. To be sure, even if total supply
    always creates an equal amount of total demand, the economy could
    still experience a situation of some firms earning profits while
    other firms suffer losses. Nevertheless, a recession is not a
    situation where all business failures are exactly counterbalanced by
    an offsetting number of successes. A recession is a situation in
    which the economy as a whole is shrinking in size, business failures
    outnumber the remaining success stories, and many firms end up
    suffering losses and laying off workers.</span><span
    id="bookmark866">‌</span>

    <span id="bookmark867">Say’s law that supply creates its own demand
    does seem a good approximation for the long run. Over periods of
    some years or decades, as the productive power of an economy to
    supply goods and services increases, total demand in the economy
    grows at roughly the same pace. However, over shorter time horizons
    of a few months or even years, recessions or even depressions occur
    in which firms, as a group, seem to face a lack of demand for their
    products.</span>

    Keynes’ Law and the Macroeconomics of Demand

    <span id="bookmark868">The alternative to Say’s law, with its
    emphasis on supply, is</span> **Keynes’ law**: “Demand creates its
    own supply.” As a

      

      

    <span id="bookmark869">matter of historical accuracy, just as
    Jean-Baptiste Say never wrote down anything as simpleminded as Say’s
    law, John Maynard Keynes never wrote down Keynes’ law, but the law
    is a useful simplification that conveys a certain point of
    view.</span>

    <span id="bookmark870">When Keynes wrote his influential work</span>
    *The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money* during the
    1930s Great Depression, he pointed out that during the Depression,
    the economy's capacity to supply goods and services had not changed
    much. U.S. unemployment rates soared higher than 20% from 1933 to
    1935, but the number of possible workers had not increased or
    decreased much. Factories closed, but machinery and equipment had
    not disappeared. Technologies that had been invented in the 1920s
    were not un-invented and forgotten in the 1930s. Thus, Keynes argued
    that the Great Depression—and many ordinary recessions as well—were
    not caused by a drop in the ability of the economy to supply goods
    as measured by labor, physical capital, or technology. He argued the
    economy often produced less than its full potential, not because it
    was technically impossible to produce more with the existing workers
    and machines, but because a lack of demand in the economy as a whole
    led to inadequate incentives for firms to produce. In such cases, he
    argued, the level of GDP in the economy was not primarily determined
    by the potential of what the economy could supply, but rather by the
    amount of total demand.

    Keynes’ law seems to apply fairly well in the short run of a few
    months to a few years, when many firms experience either a drop in
    demand for their output during a recession or so much demand that
    they have trouble producing enough during an economic boom. However,
    demand cannot tell the whole macroeconomic story, either. After all,
    if demand was all that mattered at the macroeconomic level, then the
    government could make the economy as large as it wanted just by
    pumping up total demand through a large increase in the government
    spending component or by legislating large tax cuts to push up the
    consumption component. Economies do, however, face genuine limits to
    how much they can produce, limits determined by the quantity of
    labor, physical capital, technology, and the institutional and
    market structures that bring these factors of production together.
    These constraints on what an economy can supply at the macroeconomic
    level do not disappear just because of an increase in demand.

    Combining Supply and Demand in Macroeconomics

    Two insights emerge from this overview of Say’s law with its
    emphasis on macroeconomic supply and Keynes’ law with its emphasis
    on macroeconomic demand. The first conclusion, which is not exactly
    a hot news flash, is that an economic approach focused only on the
    supply side or only on the demand side can be only a partial
    success. We need to take into account both supply and demand. The
    second conclusion is that since Keynes’ law applies more accurately
    in the short run and Say’s law applies more accurately in the long
    run, the tradeoffs and connections between the three goals of
    macroeconomics may be different in the short run and the long run.

    style=" color: #3767B1;">Building a Model of Aggregate Demand and
    Aggregate Supply</span><span id="bookmark871">‌</span>

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Explain the aggregate supply curve and how it relates to real
        GDP and potential GDP

    -   Explain the aggregate demand curve and how it is influenced by
        price levels

    -   Interpret the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model

    -   Identify the point of equilibrium in the aggregate
        demand/aggregate supply model

    -   Define short run aggregate supply and long run aggregate supply

      

    <span id="bookmark872">To build a useful macroeconomic model, we
    need a model that shows what determines total supply or total demand
    for the economy, and how total demand and total supply interact at
    the macroeconomic level. We call this the</span> **aggregate
    demand/aggregate supply model**. This module will explain aggregate
    supply, aggregate demand, and the equilibrium between them. The
    following modules will discuss the causes of shifts in aggregate
    supply and aggregate demand.

    The Aggregate Supply Curve and Potential GDP

    <span id="bookmark873">Firms make decisions about what quantity to
    supply based on the profits they expect to earn. They determine
    profits, in turn, by the price of the outputs they sell and by the
    prices of the inputs, like labor or raw materials, that they need to
    buy.</span> **Aggregate supply (AS)** refers to the total quantity
    of output (i.e. real GDP) firms will produce and sell. The

      

      

    <span id="bookmark874">aggregate supply (AS) curve</span> <span
    class="p">shows the total quantity of output (i.e. real GDP) that
    firms will produce and sell at each price level.</span>

    <a href="#bookmark875" class="a">Figure 11.3</a> <span
    class="p">shows an aggregate supply curve. In the following
    paragraphs, we will walk through the elements of the diagram one at
    a time: the horizontal and vertical axes, the aggregate supply curve
    itself, and the meaning of the potential GDP vertical line.</span>

      

      

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_244.jpg" width="326" height="256" alt="image" />

    <span id="bookmark875">Figure 11.3 The Aggregate Supply Curve</span>
    <span class="s37">Aggregate supply (AS) slopes up, because as the
    price level for outputs rises, with the price of inputs remaining
    fixed, firms have an incentive to produce more to earn higher
    profits. The potential GDP line shows the maximum that the economy
    can produce with full employment of workers and physical
    capital.</span>

      

    <a href="#bookmark432" class="s34">The diagram's horizontal axis shows real GDP—that is, the level of GDP adjusted for inflation. The vertical axis shows the price level, which measures the average price of all goods and services produced in the economy. In other words, the price level in the AD-AS model is what we called the GDP Deflator in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark432" class="a">The Macroeconomic</a>
    Perspective<span class="p">. Remember that the price level is
    different from the inflation rate. Visualize the price level as an
    index number, like the Consumer Price Index, while the inflation
    rate is the percentage change in the price level over time.</span>

    As the price level rises, real GDP rises as well. Why? The price
    level on the vertical axis represents prices for final goods or
    outputs bought in the economy—i.e. the GDP deflator—not the price
    level for intermediate goods and services that are inputs to
    production. Thus, the AS curve describes how suppliers will react to
    a higher price level for final outputs of goods and services, while
    holding the prices of inputs like labor and energy constant. If
    firms across the economy face a situation where the price level of
    what they produce and sell is rising, but their costs of production
    are not rising, then the lure of higher profits will induce them to
    expand production. In other words, an aggregate supply curve shows
    how producers as a group will respond to an increase in aggregate
    demand.

    <span id="bookmark876">An AS curve's slope changes from nearly flat
    at its far left to nearly vertical at its far right. At the far left
    of the aggregate supply curve, the level of output in the economy is
    far below</span> **potential GDP**, which we define as the amount of
    real GDP an economy can produce by fully employing its existing
    levels of labor, physical capital, and technology, in the context of
    its existing market and legal institutions. At these relatively low
    levels of output, levels of unemployment are high, and many
    factories are running only part-time, or have closed their doors. In
    this situation, a relatively small increase in the prices of the
    outputs that businesses sell—while assuming no rise in input
    prices—can encourage a considerable surge in the quantity of
    aggregate supply because so many workers and factories are ready to
    swing into production.

    As the GDP increases, however, some firms and industries will start
    running into limits: perhaps nearly all of the expert workers in a
    certain industry will have jobs or factories in certain geographic
    areas or industries will be running at full speed. In the AS curve's
    intermediate area, a higher price level for outputs continues to
    encourage a greater quantity of output—but as the increasingly steep
    upward slope of the aggregate supply curve shows, the increase in
    real GDP in response to a given rise in the price level will not be
    as large. (Read the following Clear It Up feature to learn why the
    AS curve crosses potential GDP.)

      

    Why does AS cross potential GDP?

    Economists typically draw the aggregate supply curve to cross the
    potential GDP line. This shape may seem puzzling: How can an economy
    produce at an output level which is higher than its “potential” or
    “full employment” GDP? The economic intuition here is that if prices
    for outputs were high enough, producers would make fanatical efforts
    to produce: all workers would be on double-overtime, all machines
    would run 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Such hyper-intense
    production would go beyond using potential labor and physical
    capital resources fully, to using them in a way that is not
    sustainable in the long term. Thus, it is possible for production to
    sprint above potential GDP, but only in the short run.

      

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_245.png" width="624" height="51" alt="image" />

    <span id="bookmark877">At the far right, the aggregate supply curve
    becomes nearly vertical. At this quantity, higher prices for outputs
    cannot encourage additional output, because even if firms want to
    expand output, the inputs of labor and machinery in the economy are
    fully employed. In this example, the vertical line in the exhibit
    shows that potential GDP occurs at a total output of 9,500. When an
    economy is operating at its potential GDP, machines and factories
    are running at capacity, and the unemployment rate is relatively
    low—at the natural rate of unemployment. For this reason, potential
    GDP is sometimes also called</span> **full-employment GDP**.

    The Aggregate Demand Curve

    <span id="bookmark878">Aggregate demand (AD)</span>
    <a href="#bookmark1788" class="s34">refers to the amount of total spending on domestic goods and services in an economy. (Strictly speaking, AD is what economists call total planned expenditure. We will further explain this distinction in the appendix</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1788" class="a">The Expenditure-Output Model</a><span
    class="s54"> </span><span class="p">. For now, just think of
    aggregate demand as total spending.) It includes all four components
    of demand: consumption, investment, government spending, and net
    exports (exports minus imports). This demand is determined by a
    number of factors, but one of them is the price level—recall though,
    that the price level is an index number such as the GDP deflator
    that measures the average price of the things we buy. The
    </span>aggregate demand (AD) curve <span class="p">shows the total
    spending on domestic goods and services at each price
    level.</span><span id="bookmark879">‌</span>

    <a href="#bookmark880" class="a">Figure 11.4</a> <span
    class="p">presents an aggregate demand (AD) curve. Just like the
    aggregate supply curve, the horizontal axis shows real GDP and the
    vertical axis shows the price level. The AD curve slopes down, which
    means that increases in the price level of outputs lead to a lower
    quantity of total spending. The reasons behind this shape are
    related to how changes in the price level affect the different
    components of aggregate demand. The following components comprise
    aggregate demand: consumption spending (C), investment spending (I),
    government spending (G), and spending on exports (X) minus imports
    (M): C + I + G + X – M.</span>

      

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_246.jpg" width="326" height="256" alt="image" />

    <span id="bookmark880">Figure 11.4 The Aggregate Demand Curve</span>
    <span class="s37">Aggregate demand (AD) slopes down, showing that,
    as the price level rises, the amount of total spending on domestic
    goods and services declines.</span>

      

    The wealth effect holds that as the price level increases, the
    buying power of savings that people have stored up in bank accounts
    and other assets will diminish, eaten away to some extent by
    inflation. Because a rise in the price level reduces people’s
    wealth, consumption spending will fall as the price level rises.

    The interest rate effect is that as prices for outputs rise, the
    same purchases will take more money or credit to accomplish. This
    additional demand for money and credit will push interest rates
    higher. In turn, higher interest rates will reduce borrowing by
    businesses for investment purposes and reduce borrowing by
    households for homes and cars—thus reducing consumption and
    investment spending.

    <span id="bookmark881">The foreign price effect points out that if
    prices rise in the United States while remaining fixed in other
    countries, then goods in the United States will be relatively more
    expensive compared to goods in the rest of the world. U.S. exports
    will be relatively more expensive, and the quantity of exports sold
    will fall. U.S. imports from abroad will be relatively cheaper, so
    the quantity of imports will rise. Thus, a higher domestic price

    <a href="#bookmark880" class="s34">Among economists all three of these effects are controversial, in part because they do not seem to be very large. For this reason, the aggregate demand curve in</a>

    Step 5. Determine where AD and AS intersect. This is the equilibrium
    with price level at 130 and real GDP at

    $680.

    Step 6. Look at the graph to determine where equilibrium is located.
    We can see that this equilibrium is fairly far from where the AS
    curve becomes near-vertical (or at least quite steep) which seems to
    start at about

    $750 of real output. This implies that the economy is not close to
    potential GDP. Thus, unemployment will be high. In the relatively
    flat part of the AS curve, where the equilibrium occurs, changes in
    the price level will not be a major concern, since such changes are
    likely to be small.

    Step 7. Determine what the steep portion of the AS curve indicates.
    Where the AS curve is steep, the economy is at or close to potential
    GDP.

    Step 8. Draw conclusions from the given information:

    -   If equilibrium occurs in the flat range of AS, then economy is
        not close to potential GDP and will be experiencing
        unemployment, but stable price level.

    -   If equilibrium occurs in the steep range of AS, then the economy
        is close or at potential GDP and will be experiencing rising
        price levels or inflationary pressures, but will have a low
        unemployment rate.

    <span id="bookmark884">Equilibrium in the Aggregate Demand/Aggregate
    Supply Model</span>

    The intersection of the aggregate supply and aggregate demand curves
    shows the equilibrium level of real GDP and the equilibrium price
    level in the economy. At a relatively low price level for output,
    firms have little incentive to produce, although consumers would be
    willing to purchase a large quantity of output. As the price level
    rises, aggregate supply rises and aggregate demand falls until the
    equilibrium point is reached.

    Confusion sometimes arises between the aggregate supply and
    aggregate demand model and the microeconomic analysis of demand and
    supply in particular markets for goods, services, labor, and
    capital. Read the following Clear It Up feature to gain an
    understanding of whether AS and AD are macro or micro.

      

    Are AS and AD macro or micro?

    These aggregate supply and demand models and the microeconomic
    analysis of demand and supply in particular markets for goods,
    services, labor, and capital have a superficial resemblance, but
    they also have many underlying differences.

    For example, the vertical and horizontal axes have distinctly
    different meanings in macroeconomic and microeconomic diagrams. The
    vertical axis of a microeconomic demand and supply diagram expresses
    a price (or wage or rate of return) for an individual good or
    service. This price is implicitly relative: it is intended to be
    compared with the prices of other products (for example, the price
    of pizza relative to the price of fried chicken). In contrast, the
    vertical axis of an aggregate supply and aggregate demand diagram
    expresses the level of a price index like the Consumer Price Index
    or the GDP deflator—combining a wide array of prices from across the
    economy. The price level is absolute: it is not intended to be
    compared to any other prices since it is essentially the average
    price of all products in an economy. The horizontal axis of a
    microeconomic supply and demand curve measures the quantity of a
    particular good or service. In contrast, the horizontal axis of the
    aggregate demand and aggregate supply diagram measures GDP, which is
    the sum of all the final goods and services produced in the economy,
    not the quantity in a specific market.

    In addition, the economic reasons for the shapes of the curves in
    the macroeconomic model are different from the reasons behind the
    shapes of the curves in microeconomic models. Demand curves for
    individual goods or services slope down primarily because of the
    existence of substitute goods, not the wealth effects, interest
    rate, and foreign price effects associated with aggregate demand
    curves. The slopes of individual supply and demand curves can have a
    variety of different slopes, depending on the extent to which
    quantity demanded and quantity supplied react to price in that
    specific market, but the slopes of the AS and AD curves are much the
    same in every diagram (although as we shall see in later chapters,
    short-run and long-run perspectives will emphasize different parts
    of the AS curve).

    In short, just because the AD/AS diagram has two lines that cross,
    do not assume that it is the same as every other diagram where two
    lines cross. The intuitions and meanings of the macro and micro
    diagrams are only

      

    distant cousins from different branches of the economics family
    tree.

      

    Defining SRAS and LRAS

    <span id="bookmark886">In the Clear It Up feature titled “Why does
    AS cross potential GDP?” we differentiated between short run changes
    in aggregate supply which the AS curve shows and long run changes in
    aggregate supply which the vertical line at potential GDP defines.
    In the short run, if demand is too low (or too high), it is possible
    for producers to supply less GDP (or more GDP) than potential. In
    the long run, however, producers are limited to producing at
    potential GDP. For this reason, we may also refer to what we have
    been calling the AS curve as the</span> **short run aggregate supply
    (SRAS) curve**. We may also refer to the vertical line at potential
    GDP as the **long run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve**.<span

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Explain how productivity growth changes the aggregate supply
        curve

    -   Explain how changes in input prices change the aggregate supply
        curve

      

    The original equilibrium in the AD/AS diagram will shift to a new
    equilibrium if the AS or AD curve shifts. When the aggregate supply
    curve shifts to the right, then at every price level, producers
    supply a greater quantity of real GDP. When the AS curve shifts to
    the left, then at every price level, producers supply a lower
    quantity of real GDP. This module discusses two of the most
    important factors that can lead to shifts in the AS curve:
    productivity growth and changes in input prices.

    How Productivity Growth Shifts the AS Curve

    <a href="#bookmark891" id="bookmark889" class="s34">In the long run, the most important factor shifting the AS curve is productivity growth. Productivity means how much output can be produced with a given quantity of labor. One measure of this is output per worker or GDP per capita. Over time, productivity grows so that the same quantity of labor can produce more output. Historically, the real growth in GDP per capita in an advanced economy like the United States has averaged about 2% to 3% per year, but productivity growth has been faster during certain extended periods like the 1960s and the late 1990s through the early 2000s, or slower during periods like the 1970s. A higher level of productivity shifts the AS curve to the right, because with improved productivity, firms can produce a greater quantity of output at every price level.</a>
    <a href="#bookmark891" class="a">Figure</a>
    [11.7](#bookmark891)<span id="bookmark890">‌</span>

    \(a\) shows an outward shift in productivity over two time periods.
    The AS curve shifts out from SRAS<span class="s60">0</span> to
    SRAS<span class="s60">1</span> to SRAS<span class="s60">2</span>,
    and the equilibrium shifts from E<span class="s60">0</span> to
    E<span class="s60">1</span> to E<span class="s60">2</span>. Note
    that with increased productivity, workers can produce more GDP.
    Thus, full employment corresponds to a higher level of potential
    GDP, which we show as a rightward shift in LRAS from LRAS<span
    class="s60">0</span> to LRAS<span class="s60">1</span> to LRAS<span
    class="s60">2</span>.

      

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_251.jpg" width="621" height="333" alt="image" />

    <span id="bookmark891"><span class="s36">Figure 11.7 Shifts in
    Aggregate Supply </span></span>(a) The rise in productivity causes
    the SRAS curve to shift to the right. The original equilibrium
    E<span class="s63">0</span> is at the intersection of AD and
    SRAS<span class="s63">0</span>. When SRAS shifts right, then the new
    equilibrium E<span class="s63">1</span> is at the intersection of AD
    and SRAS<span class="s63">1</span>, and then yet another
    equilibrium, E<span class="s63">2</span>, is at the intersection of
    AD and SRAS<span class="s63">2</span>.

    Shifts in SRAS to the right, lead to a greater level of output and
    to downward pressure on the price level. (b) A higher price for
    inputs means that at any given price level for outputs, a lower real
    GDP will be produced so aggregate supply will shift to the left from
    SRAS<span class="s63">0</span> to SRAS<span class="s63">1</span>.
    The new equilibrium, E<span class="s63">1</span>, has a reduced
    quantity of output and a higher price level than the original
    equilibrium (E<span class="s63">0</span>).

      

    <a href="#bookmark96" class="s34">A shift in the SRAS curve to the right will result in a greater real GDP and downward pressure on the price level, if aggregate demand remains unchanged. However, if this shift in SRAS results from gains in productivity growth, which we typically measure in terms of a few percentage points per year, the effect will be relatively small over a few months or even a couple of years. Recall how in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark96" class="a">Choice in a World of</a>
    Scarcity<span class="p">, we said that a nation's production
    possibilities frontier is fixed in the short run, but shifts out in
    the long run? This is the same phenomenon using a different
    model.</span>

    How Changes in Input Prices Shift the AS Curve

    <a href="#bookmark891" class="s34">Higher prices for inputs that are widely used across the entire economy can have a macroeconomic impact on aggregate supply. Examples of such widely used inputs include labor and energy products. Increases in the price of such inputs will cause the SRAS curve to shift to the left, which means that at each given price level for outputs, a higher price for inputs will discourage production because it will reduce the possibilities for earning profits.</a>
    [Figure](#bookmark891)

    <a href="#bookmark891" id="bookmark892" class="a">11.7</a><span
    class="s54"> </span>(b) shows the aggregate supply curve shifting to
    the left, from SRAS<span class="s60">0</span> to SRAS<span
    class="s60">1</span>, causing the equilibrium to move from E<span
    class="s60">0</span> to E<span class="s60">1</span>. The movement
    from the original equilibrium of E<span class="s60">0</span> to the
    new equilibrium of E<span class="s60">1</span> will bring a nasty
    set of effects: reduced GDP or recession, higher unemployment
    because the economy is now further away from potential GDP, and an
    inflationary higher price level as well. For example, the U.S.
    economy experienced recessions in 1974–1975, 1980–1982, 1990–91,
    2001, and 2007–2009 that were each preceded or accompanied by a rise
    in the key input of oil prices. In the 1970s, this pattern of a
    shift to the left in SRAS leading to a stagnant economy with high
    unemployment and inflation was nicknamed **stagflation**.

    <a href="#bookmark891" class="s34">Conversely, a decline in the price of a key input like oil will shift the SRAS curve to the right, providing an incentive for more to be produced at every given price level for outputs. From 1985 to 1986, for example, the average price of crude oil fell by almost half, from $24 a barrel to $12 a barrel. Similarly, from 1997 to 1998, the price of a barrel of crude oil dropped from $17 per barrel to $11 per barrel. In both cases, the plummeting oil price led to a situation like that which we presented earlier in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark891" class="a">Figure 11.7</a> <span
    class="p">(a), where the outward shift of SRAS to the right allowed
    the economy to expand, unemployment to fall, and inflation to
    decline.</span>

      

      

    Along with energy prices, two other key inputs that may shift the
    SRAS curve are the cost of labor, or wages, and the cost of imported
    goods that we use as inputs for other products. In these cases as
    well, the lesson is that lower prices for inputs cause SRAS to shift
    to the right, while higher prices cause it to shift back to the
    left. Note that, unlike changes in productivity, changes in input
    prices do not generally cause LRAS to shift, only SRAS.

    Other Supply Shocks

    The aggregate supply curve can also shift due to shocks to input
    goods or labor. For example, an unexpected early freeze could
    destroy a large number of agricultural crops, a shock that would
    shift the AS curve to the left since there would be fewer
    agricultural products available at any given price.

    Similarly, shocks to the labor market can affect aggregate supply.
    An extreme example might be an overseas war that required a large
    number of workers to cease their ordinary production in order to go
    fight for their country. In this case, SRAS and LRAS would both
    shift to the left because there would be fewer workers available to
    produce goods at any given price.

        Do imports diminish aggregate demand?

        We have seen that the formula for aggregate demand is AD = C +
        I + G + X - M, where M is the total value of imported goods. Why
        is there a minus sign in front of imports? Does this mean that
        more imports will result in a lower level of aggregate demand?
        The short answer is yes, because aggregate demand is defined as
        total demand for domestically produced goods and services.

        When an American buys a foreign product, for example, it gets
        counted along with all the other consumption. Thus, the income
        generated does not go to American producers, but rather to
        producers in another country. It would be wrong to count this as
        part of domestic demand. Therefore, imports added in consumption
        are subtracted back out in the M term of the equation.

        Because of the way in which we write the demand equation, it is
        easy to make the mistake of thinking that imports are bad for
        the economy. Just keep in mind that every negative number in the
        M term has a corresponding positive number in the C or I or G
        term, and they always cancel out.

        <a href="#bookmark952" class="s34">As we mentioned previously, the components of aggregate demand are consumption spending (C), investment spending (I), government spending (G), and spending on exports (X) minus imports (M). (Read the following Clear It Up feature for explanation of why imports are subtracted from exports and what this means for aggregate demand.) A shift of the AD curve to the right means that at least one of these components increased so that a greater amount of total spending would occur at every price level. A shift of the AD curve to the left means that at least one of these components decreased so that a lesser amount of total spending would occur at every price level.</a>
        <a href="#bookmark952" class="a">The Keynesian Perspective</a>
        <span class="p">will discuss the components of aggregate demand
        and the factors that affect them. Here, the discussion will
        sketch two broad categories that could cause AD curves to shift:
        changes in consumer or firm behavior and changes in government
        tax or spending policy.</span>

          

          

        How Changes by Consumers and Firms Can Affect AD

        <span id="bookmark894">When consumers feel more confident about
        the future of the economy, they tend to consume more. If
        business confidence is high, then firms tend to spend more on
        investment, believing that the future payoff from that
        investment will be substantial. Conversely, if consumer or
        business confidence drops, then consumption and investment
        spending decline.</span>

        <a href="http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/" id="bookmark895" class="s34">The University of Michigan publishes a survey of consumer confidence and constructs an index of consumer confidence each month. The survey results are then reported at</a>
        <a href="http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/" class="a">http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu (http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/)</a>
        <span class="p">, which break down the change in consumer
        confidence among different income levels. According to that
        index, consumer confidence averaged around 90 prior to the Great
        Recession, and then it fell to below 60 in late 2008, which was
        the lowest it had been since 1980. Since then, confidence has
        climbed from a 2011 low of 55.8 back to a level in the low 80s,
        which economists consider close to a healthy state.</span>

        The Organization for Economic Development and Cooperation (OECD)
        publishes one measure of business confidence: the "business
        tendency surveys". The OECD collects business opinion survey
        data for 21 countries on future selling prices and employment,
        among other business climate elements. After sharply declining
        during the Great Recession, the measure has risen above zero
        again and is back to long-term averages (the indicator dips
        below zero when business outlook is weaker than usual). Of
        course, either of these survey measures is not very precise.
        They can however, suggest when confidence is rising or falling,
        as well as when it is relatively high or low compared to the
        past.

        Because economists associate a rise in confidence with higher
        consumption and investment demand, it will lead to an outward
        shift in the AD curve, and a move of the equilibrium, from
        E<span class="s60">0</span> to E<span
        class="s60">1</span><a href="#bookmark896" class="s34">, to a higher quantity of output and a higher price level, as</a>

        <a href="#bookmark896" class="s34">Consumer and business confidence often reflect macroeconomic realities; for example, confidence is usually high when the economy is growing briskly and low during a recession. However, economic confidence can sometimes rise or fall for reasons that do not have a close connection to the immediate economy, like a risk of war, election results, foreign policy events, or a pessimistic prediction about the future by a prominent public figure. U.S. presidents, for example, must be careful in their public pronouncements about the economy. If they offer economic pessimism, they risk provoking a decline in confidence that reduces consumption and investment and shifts AD to the left, and in a self-fulfilling prophecy, contributes to causing the recession that the president warned against in the first place.</a>

        from AD<span class="s63">0</span> to AD<span

        equilibrium (E<span class="s63">1</span>) will have a higher

        the original equilibrium (E<span class="s63">0</span>). In this

        equilibrium (E<span class="s63">1</span>) is also farther below
        potential GDP. A decrease in government spending or higher taxes
        that leads to a fall in consumer spending can also shift AD to
        the left.

          

        How Government Macroeconomic Policy Choices Can Shift AD

        <a href="#bookmark896" class="s34">Government spending is one component of AD. Thus, higher government spending will cause AD to shift to the right, as in</a>
        <a href="#bookmark896" class="a">Figure 11.8</a>
        <a href="#bookmark896" class="s34">(a), while lower government spending will cause AD to shift to the left, as in</a>
        <a href="#bookmark896" class="a">Figure 11.8</a> <span
        class="p">(b). For example, in the United States, government
        spending declined by 3.2% of GDP during the 1990s, from 21% of
        GDP in 1991, and to 17.8% of GDP in 1998. However, from 2005 to
        2009, the peak of the Great Recession, government spending
        increased from 19% of GDP to 21.4% of GDP. If changes of a few
        percentage points of GDP seem small to you, remember that since
        GDP was about $14.4 trillion in 2009, a seemingly small change
        of 2% of GDP is equal to close to $300 billion.</span>

        <span id="bookmark897">Tax policy can affect consumption and
        investment spending, too. Tax cuts for individuals will tend to
        increase consumption demand, while tax increases will tend to
        diminish it. Tax policy can also pump up investment demand by
        offering lower tax rates for corporations or tax reductions that
        benefit specific kinds of investment. Shifting C or I will shift
        the AD curve as a whole.</span>

        losses, the</span>

        <a href="#bookmark899" class="s34">U.S. Congress often passes tax cuts. During the 2001 recession, for example, the U.S. Congress enacted a tax cut into law. At such times, the political rhetoric often focuses on how people experiencing hard times need relief from taxes. The aggregate supply and aggregate demand framework, however, offers a complementary rationale, as</a>
        <a href="#bookmark899" class="a">Figure</a> <span
        class="s54">11.9 </span>illustrates. The original equilibrium
        during a recession is at point E<span class="s60">0</span>,
        relatively far from the full employment level of output. The tax
        cut, by increasing consumption, shifts the AD curve to the
        right. At the new equilibrium (E<span class="s60">1</span>),
        real GDP rises and unemployment falls and, because in this
        diagram the economy has not yet reached its potential or full
        employment level of GDP, any rise in the price level remains
        muted. Read the following Clear It Up feature to consider the
        question of whether economists favor tax cuts or oppose them.

        Do economists favor tax cuts or oppose them?

        One of the most fundamental divisions in American politics over
        the last few decades has been between those who believe that the
        government should cut taxes substantially and those who
        disagree. Ronald Reagan rode into the presidency in 1980 partly
        because of his promise, soon carried out, to enact a substantial
        tax cut. George Bush lost his bid for reelection against Bill
        Clinton in 1992 partly because he had broken his 1988 promise:
        “Read my lips! No new taxes!” In the 2000 presidential election,
        both George W. Bush and Al Gore advocated substantial tax cuts
        and Bush succeeded in pushing a tax cut package through Congress
        early in 2001. More recently in 2017, Donald Trump has pushed
        for tax cuts to stimulate the economy. Disputes over tax cuts
        often ignite at the state and local level as well.

        What side do economists take? Do they support broad tax cuts or
        oppose them? The answer, unsatisfying to zealots on both sides,
        is that it depends. One issue is whether equally large
        government spending cuts accompany the tax cuts. Economists
        differ, as does any broad cross-section of the public, on how
        large government spending should be and what programs the
        government might cut back. A second issue, more

        <span id="bookmark899"><span class="s36">Figure 11.9 Recession
        and Full Employment in the AD/AS Model </span></span>Whether the
        economy is in a recession is illustrated in the AD/AS model by
        how close the equilibrium is to the potential GDP line as
        indicated by the vertical LRAS line. In this example, the level
        of output Y<span class="s63">0</span> at the equilibrium E<span
        class="s63">0</span> is relatively far from the potential GDP
        line, so it can represent an economy in recession, well below
        the full employment level of GDP. In contrast, the level of
        output Y<span class="s63">1</span> at the equilibrium E<span
        class="s63">1</span> is relatively close to potential GDP, and
        so it would represent an economy with a lower unemployment rate.

          

          

        relevant to the discussion in this chapter, concerns how close
        the economy is to the full employment output level. In a
        recession, when the AD and AS curves intersect far below the
        full employment level, tax cuts can make sense as a way of
        shifting AD to the right. However, when the economy is already
        performing extremely well, tax cuts may shift AD so far to the
        right as to generate inflationary pressures, with little gain to
        GDP.

        With the AD/AS framework in mind, many economists might readily
        believe that the 1981 Reagan tax cuts, which took effect just
        after two serious recessions, were beneficial economic policy.
        Similarly, Congress enacted the 2001 Bush tax cuts and the 2009
        Obama tax cuts during recessions. However, some of the same
        economists who favor tax cuts during recession would be much
        more dubious about identical tax cuts at a time the economy is
        performing well and cyclical unemployment is low.

          

        <a href="#bookmark1384" class="s34">Government spending and tax rate changes can be useful tools to affect aggregate demand. We will discuss these in greater detail in the</a>

        <a href="#bookmark1483" class="a">The Impacts of Government</a>
        Borrowing<a href="#bookmark1177" class="s34">. Other policy tools can shift the aggregate demand curve as well. For example, as we will discus in the</a>
        <a href="#bookmark1177" class="a">Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation</a>
        <span class="p">chapter, the Federal Reserve can affect interest
        rates and credit availability. Higher interest rates tend to
        discourage borrowing and thus reduce both household spending on
        big- ticket items like houses and cars and investment spending
        by business. Conversely, lower interest rates will stimulate
        consumption and investment demand. Interest rates can also
        affect exchange rates, which in turn will have effects on the
        export and import components of aggregate demand.</span>

        <a href="#bookmark952" class="s34">Clarifying the details of these alternative policies and how they affect the components of aggregate demand can wait for</a>
        <a href="#bookmark952" class="a">The Keynesian Perspective</a>
        <span class="p">chapter. Here, the key lesson is that a shift of
        the aggregate demand curve to the right leads to a greater real
        GDP and to upward pressure on the price level. Conversely, a
        shift of aggregate demand to the left leads to a lower real GDP
        and a lower price level. Whether these changes in output and
        price level are relatively large or relatively small, and how
        the change in equilibrium relates to potential GDP, depends on
        whether the shift in the AD curve is happening in the AS curve's
        relatively flat or relatively steep portion.</span>

        By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        -   Use the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model to show
            periods of economic growth and recession

        -   Explain how unemployment and inflation impact the aggregate

        -   Evaluate the importance of the aggregate demand/aggregate
            supply model

              

            <span id="bookmark901">The AD/AS model can convey a number
            of interlocking relationships between the three
            macroeconomic goals of growth, unemployment, and low
            inflation. Moreover, the AD/AS framework is flexible enough
            to accommodate both the Keynes’ law approach that focuses on
            aggregate demand and the short run, while also including the
            Say’s law approach that focuses on aggregate supply and the
            long run. These advantages are considerable. Every model is
            a simplified version of the deeper reality and, in the
            context of the AD/AS model, the three macroeconomic goals
            arise in ways that are sometimes indirect or incomplete. In
            this module, we consider how the AD/AS model illustrates the
            three macroeconomic goals of economic growth, low
            unemployment, and low inflation.</span>

            Growth and Recession in the AD/AS Diagram

            <a href="#bookmark891" class="s34">In the AD/AS diagram, long-run economic growth due to productivity increases over time will be represented by a gradual shift to the right of aggregate supply. The vertical line representing potential GDP (or the “full employment level of GDP”) will gradually shift to the right over time as well. Earlier</a>
            <a href="#bookmark891" class="a">Figure 11.7</a> <span

            years, with the AS curve shifting slightly out to the right
            each year. However, the factors that determine the speed of
            this long-term economic growth rate—like investment in
            physical and human capital, technology, and whether an
            economy can take advantage of catch-up growth—do not appear
            directly in the AD/AS diagram.</span>

            In the short run, GDP falls and rises in every economy, as
            the economy dips into recession or expands out of recession.

              

              

            The AD/AS diagram illustrates recessions when the
            equilibrium level of real GDP is substantially below
            potential GDP, as we see at the equilibrium point E<span
            class="s60">0</span>

            <a href="#bookmark899" class="a">Figure</a> <span
            class="s54">11.9</span>. From another standpoint, in years
            of resurgent economic growth the equilibrium will typically
            be close to potential GDP, as equilibrium point E<span
            class="s60">1</span> in that earlier figure shows.

            Unemployment in the AD/AS Diagram

            <a href="#bookmark619" id="bookmark902" class="s34">We described two types of unemployment in the</a>
            <a href="#bookmark619" class="a">Unemployment</a> <span
            class="p">chapter. Short run variations in unemployment
            (cyclical unemployment) are caused by the business cycle as
            the economy expands and contracts. Over the long run, in the
            United States, the unemployment rate typically hovers around
            5% (give or take one percentage point or so), when the
            economy is healthy. In many of the national economies across
            Europe, the unemployment rate in recent decades has only
            dropped to about 10% or a bit lower, even in good economic
            years. We call this baseline level of unemployment that
            occurs year-in and year-out the natural rate of unemployment
            and we determine it by how well the structures of market and
            government institutions in the economy lead to a matching of
            workers and employers in the labor market. Potential GDP can
            imply different unemployment rates in different economies,
            depending on the natural rate of unemployment for that
            economy.</span><span id="bookmark903">‌</span>

            <a href="#bookmark899" class="s34">The AD/AS diagram shows cyclical unemployment by how close the economy is to the potential or full GDP employment level. Returning to</a>

            is close to potential GDP, as in the equilibrium point
            E<span class="s60">1</span>. Conversely, high cyclical
            unemployment arises when the output is substantially to the
            left of potential GDP on the AD/AS diagram, as at the
            equilibrium point E<span class="s60">0</span>. Although we
            do not show the factors that determine the natural rate of
            unemployment separately in the AD/AS model, they are
            implicitly part of what determines potential GDP or full
            employment GDP in a given economy.

            Inflationary Pressures in the AD/AS Diagram

            Inflation fluctuates in the short run. Higher inflation
            rates have typically occurred either during or just after
            economic booms: for example, the biggest spurts of inflation
            in the U.S. economy during the twentieth century followed
            the wartime booms of World War I and World War II.
            Conversely, rates of inflation generally decline during
            recessions. As an extreme example, inflation actually became
            negative—a situation called “deflation”—during the Great
            Depression. Even during the relatively short 1991-1992
            recession, the inflation rate declined from 5.4% in 1990 to
            3.0% in 1992. During the relatively short 2001 recession,
            the rate of inflation declined from 3.4% in 2000 to 1.6%
            in 2002. During the deep recession of 2007–2009, the
            inflation rate declined from 3.8% in 2008 to –0.4% in 2009.
            Some countries have experienced bouts of high inflation that
            lasted for years. In the U.S. economy since the mid–1980s,
            inflation does not seem to have had any long-term trend to
            be substantially higher. Instead, it has stayed in the 1–5%
            range annually.

            <a href="#bookmark904" class="s34">The AD/AS framework implies two ways that inflationary pressures may arise. One possible trigger is if aggregate demand continues to shift to the right when the economy is already at or near potential GDP and full employment, thus pushing the macroeconomic equilibrium into the AS curve's steep portion.

            <a href="#bookmark904" class="a">Figure 11.10</a><span

            class="s60">1</span> is clearly at a higher price level than
            the original equilibrium E<span class="s60">0</span>. In
            this situation, the aggregate demand in the economy has
            soared so high that firms in the economy are not capable of
            producing additional goods, because labor and physical
            capital are fully employed, and so additional increases in
            aggregate demand can only result in a rise in the price
            level.

            lower price level (P<span class="s63">0</span>).

              

            <a href="#bookmark904" class="s34">An alternative source of inflationary pressures can occur due to a rise in input prices that affects many or most firms across the economy—perhaps an important input to production like oil or labor—and causes the aggregate supply curve to shift back to the left. In</a>
            <a href="#bookmark904" class="a">Figure 11.10</a><span

            class="s60">1</span> at the new equilibrium (E<span
            class="s60">1</span>). In effect, the rise in input prices
            ends up, after the final output is produced and sold,
            passing along in the form of a higher price level for
            outputs.

            The AD/AS diagram shows only a one-time shift in the price
            level. It does not address the question of what would cause
            inflation either to vanish after a year, or to sustain
            itself for several years. There are two explanations for why
            inflation may persist over time. One way that continual
            inflationary price increases can occur is if the government
            continually attempts to stimulate aggregate demand in a way
            that keeps pushing the AD curve when it is already in the
            SRAS curve's steep portion. A second possibility is that, if
            inflation has been occurring for several years, people might
            begin to expect a certain level of inflation. If they do,
            then these expectations will cause prices, wages and
            interest rates to increase annually by the amount of the
            inflation expected. These two reasons are interrelated,
            because if a government fosters a macroeconomic environment
            with inflationary pressures, then people will grow to expect
            inflation. However, the AD/AS diagram does not show these
            patterns of ongoing or expected inflation in a direct way.

            Importance of the Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model

            Macroeconomics takes an overall view of the economy, which
            means that it needs to juggle many different concepts. For
            example, start with the three macroeconomic goals of growth,
            low inflation, and low unemployment. Aggregate demand has
            four elements: consumption, investment, government spending,
            and exports less imports. Aggregate supply reveals how
            businesses throughout the economy will react to a higher
            price level for outputs. Finally, a wide array of economic
            events and policy decisions can affect aggregate demand and
            aggregate supply, including government tax and spending
            decisions; consumer and business confidence; changes in
            prices of key inputs like oil; and technology that brings
            higher levels of productivity.

            <a href="#bookmark96" class="s34">The aggregate demand/aggregate supply model is one of the fundamental diagrams in this course (like the budget constraint diagram that we introduced in the</a>

        By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        -   Identify the neoclassical zone, the intermediate zone, and
            the Keynesian zone in the aggregate demand/aggregate supply

        -   Use an aggregate demand/aggregate supply model as a

            economy

  

<a href="#bookmark907" id="bookmark906" class="s34">We can use the AD/AS model to illustrate both Say’s law that supply creates its own demand and Keynes’ law that demand creates its own supply. Consider the SRAS curve's three zones which</a>

class="s37">Near the equilibrium Ek, in the Keynesian zone at the far
left of the SRAS curve, small shifts in AD, either to the right or the
left, will affect the output level Yk, but will not much affect the
price level. In the Keynesian zone, AD largely determines the quantity
of output. Near the equilibrium En, in the neoclassical zone at the SRAS
curve's far right, small shifts in AD, either to the right or the left,
will have relatively little effect on the output level Yn, but instead
will have a greater effect on the price level. In the neoclassical zone,
the near-vertical SRAS curve close to the level of potential GDP largely
determines the quantity of output. In the intermediate zone around
equilibrium Ei, movement in AD to the right will increase both the
output level and the price level, while a movement in AD to the left
would decrease both the output level and the price level.</span>

  

<span id="bookmark908">Focus first on the</span> **Keynesian zone**,
that portion of the SRAS curve on the far left which is relatively flat.
If the AD curve crosses this portion of the SRAS curve at an equilibrium
point like Ek, then certain statements about the economic situation will
follow. In the Keynesian zone, the equilibrium level of real GDP is far
below potential GDP, the economy is in recession, and cyclical
unemployment is high. If aggregate demand shifted to the right or left
in the Keynesian zone, it will determine the resulting level of output
(and thus unemployment). However, inflationary price pressure is not
much of a worry in the Keynesian zone, since the price level does not
vary much in this zone.

<span id="bookmark909">Now, focus your attention on the</span>
**neoclassical zone** of the SRAS curve, which is the near-vertical
portion on the right- hand side. If the AD curve crosses this portion of
the SRAS curve at an equilibrium point like En where output is at or
near potential GDP, then the size of potential GDP pretty much
determines the level of output in the economy.

  

  

Since the equilibrium is near potential GDP, cyclical unemployment is
low in this economy, although structural unemployment may remain an
issue. In the neoclassical zone, shifts of aggregate demand to the right
or the left have little effect on the level of output or employment. The
only way to increase the size of the real GDP in the neoclassical zone
is for AS to shift to the right. However, shifts in AD in the
neoclassical zone will create pressures to change the price level.

<span id="bookmark910">Finally, consider the SRAS curve's</span>
**intermediate zone** <a href="#bookmark907" class="s34">in</a>
<a href="#bookmark907" class="a">Figure</a> <span
class="s54">11.11</span>. If the AD curve crosses this portion of the
SRAS curve at an equilibrium point like Ei, then we might expect
unemployment and inflation to move in opposing directions. For instance,
a shift of AD to the right will move output closer to potential GDP and
thus reduce unemployment, but will also lead to a higher price level and
upward pressure on inflation. Conversely, a shift of AD to the left will
move output further from potential GDP and raise unemployment, but will
also lead to a lower price level and downward pressure on inflation.

<a href="#bookmark952" class="s34">This approach of dividing the SRAS curve into different zones works as a diagnostic test that we can apply to an economy, like a doctor checking a patient for symptoms. First, figure out in what zone the economy is. This will clarify the economic issues, tradeoffs, and policy choices. Some economists believe that the economy is strongly predisposed to be in one zone or another. Thus, hard-line Keynesian economists believe that the economies are in the Keynesian zone most of the time, and so they view the neoclassical zone as a theoretical abstraction. Conversely, hard-line neoclassical economists argue that economies are in the neoclassical zone most of the time and that the Keynesian zone is a distraction.</a>

From Housing Bubble to Housing Bust

We can explain economic fluctuations, whether those experienced during
the 1930s Great Depression, the 1970s stagflation, or the 2008-2009
Great Recession, can be explained using the AD/AS diagram. Short- run
fluctuations in output occur due to shifts of the SRAS curve, the AD
curve, or both. In the case of the housing bubble, rising home values
caused the AD curve to shift to the right as more people felt that
rising home values increased their overall wealth. Many homeowners took
on mortgages that exceeded their ability to pay because, as home values
continued to rise, the increased value would pay off any debt
outstanding. Increased wealth due to rising home values lead to
increased home equity loans and increased spending. All these activities
pushed AD to the right, contributing to low unemployment rates and
economic growth in the United States. When the housing bubble burst,
overall wealth dropped dramatically, wiping out the recent gains. This
drop in home values was a demand shock to the U.S. economy because of
its impact directly on the wealth of the household sector, and its
contagion into the financial that essentially locked up new credit. The
AD curve shifted to the left as evidenced by the Great Recession's
rising unemployment.

Understanding the source of these macroeconomic fluctuations provided
monetary and fiscal policy makers with insight about what policy actions
to take to mitigate the impact of the housing crisis. From a monetary
policy perspective, the Federal Reserve lowered short-term interest
rates to between 0% and 0.25 %, to loosen up credit throughout the
financial system. Discretionary fiscal policy measures included the
passage of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 that allowed
for the purchase of troubled assets, such as mortgages, from financial
institutions and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 that
increased government spending on infrastructure, provided for tax cuts,
and increased transfer payments. In combination, both monetary and
fiscal policy measures were designed to help stimulate aggregate demand
in the U.S. economy, pushing the AD curve to the right.

<a href="#bookmark952" class="s84">While most economists agree on the usefulness of the AD/AS diagram in analyzing the sources of these fluctuations, there is still some disagreement about the effectiveness of policy decisions that are useful in stabilizing these fluctuations.

KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY

  

1.  <a href="#bookmark861" class="a">Macroeconomic Perspectives on Demand and</a>
    [Supply](#bookmark861)

    Neoclassical economists emphasize Say’s law, which holds that supply
    creates its own demand. Keynesian economists emphasize Keynes’ law,
    which holds that demand creates its own supply. Many mainstream
    economists take a Keynesian perspective, emphasizing the importance
    of aggregate demand, for the short run, and a neoclassical
    perspective, emphasizing the importance of aggregate supply, for the
    long run.

      

2.  <a href="#bookmark871" class="a">Building a Model of Aggregate Demand and Aggregate</a>
    [Supply](#bookmark871)

    The upward-sloping short run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve shows the
    positive relationship between the price level and the level of real
    GDP in the short run. Aggregate supply slopes up because when the
    price level for outputs increases, while the price level of inputs
    remains fixed, the opportunity for additional profits encourages
    more production. The aggregate supply curve is near-horizontal on
    the left and near-vertical on the right. In the long run,

      

      

    we show the aggregate supply by a vertical line at the level of
    potential output, which is the maximum level of output the economy
    can produce with its existing levels of workers, physical capital,
    technology, and economic institutions.

    The downward-sloping aggregate demand (AD) curve shows the
    relationship between the price level for outputs and the quantity of
    total spending in the economy. It slopes down because of: (a) the
    wealth effect, which means that a higher price level leads to lower
    real wealth, which reduces the level of consumption; (b) the
    interest rate effect, which holds that a higher price level will
    mean a greater demand for money, which will tend to drive up
    interest rates and reduce investment spending; and (c) the foreign
    price effect, which holds that a rise in the price level will make
    domestic goods relatively more expensive, discouraging exports and
    encouraging imports.

      

3.  <a href="#bookmark888" class="a">Shifts in Aggregate</a>
    [Supply](#bookmark888)

    The aggregate demand/aggregate supply (AD/AS) diagram shows how AD
    and AS interact. The intersection of the AD and AS curves shows the
    equilibrium output and price level in the economy. Movements of
    either AS or AD will result in a different equilibrium output and
    price level. The aggregate supply curve will shift out to the right
    as productivity increases. It will shift back to the left as the
    price of key inputs rises, and will shift out to the right if the
    price of key inputs falls. If the AS curve shifts back to the left,
    the combination of lower output, higher unemployment, and higher
    inflation, called stagflation, occurs. If AS shifts out to the
    right, a combination of lower inflation, higher output, and lower
    unemployment is possible.

      

4.  <a href="#bookmark893" class="a">Shifts in Aggregate</a>
    [Demand](#bookmark893)

    The AD curve will shift out as the components of aggregate demand—C,
    I, G, and X–M—rise. It will shift back to the left as these
    components fall. These factors can change because of different
    personal choices, like those resulting from consumer or business
    confidence, or from policy choices like changes in government
    spending and taxes. If the AD curve shifts to the right, then the
    equilibrium quantity of output and the price level will rise. If the
    AD curve shifts to the left, then the equilibrium quantity of output
    and the price level will fall. Whether equilibrium output changes
    relatively more than the price level or whether the price level
    changes relatively more than output is determined by where the AD
    curve intersects with the AS curve.

    The AD/AS diagram superficially resembles the microeconomic supply
    and demand diagram on the surface, but in reality, what is on the
    horizontal and vertical axes and the underlying economic reasons for
    the shapes of the curves are very different. We can illustrate
    long-term economic growth in the AD/AS framework by a gradual shift
    of the aggregate supply curve to the right. We illustrate a
    recession when the intersection of AD and AS is substantially below
    potential GDP, while we illustrate an expanding economy when the
    intersection of AS and AD is near potential GDP.

      

5.  <a href="#bookmark900" class="a">How the AD/AS Model Incorporates Growth, Unemployment, and</a>
    [Inflation](#bookmark900)

    Cyclical unemployment is relatively large in the AD/AS framework
    when the equilibrium is substantially below potential GDP. Cyclical
    unemployment is small in the AD/AS framework when the equilibrium is
    near potential GDP. The natural rate of unemployment, as determined
    by the labor market institutions of the economy, is built into what
    economists mean by potential GDP, but does not otherwise appear in
    an AD/AS diagram. The AD/AS framework shows pressures for inflation
    to rise or fall when the movement from one equilibrium to another
    causes the price level to rise or to fall. The balance of trade does
    not appear directly in the AD/AS diagram, but it appears indirectly
    in several ways. Increases in exports or declines in imports can
    cause shifts in AD. Changes in the price of key imported inputs to
    production, like oil, can cause shifts in AS. The AD/AS model is the
    key model we use in this book to understand macroeconomic issues.

      

6.  <a href="#bookmark905" class="a">Keynes’ Law and Say’s Law in the AD/AS</a>
    [Model](#bookmark905)

We can divide the SRAS curve into three zones. Keynes’ law says demand
creates its own supply, so that changes in aggregate demand cause
changes in real GDP and employment. We can show Keynes’ law on the
horizontal Keynesian zone of the aggregate supply curve. The Keynesian
zone occurs at the left of the SRAS curve where it is fairly flat, so
movements in AD will affect output, but have little effect on the price
level. Say’s law says supply creates its own demand. Changes in
aggregate demand have no effect on real GDP and employment, only on the
price level. We can show Say’s law on the vertical neoclassical zone of
the aggregate supply curve. The neoclassical zone occurs at the right of
the SRAS curve where it is fairly vertical, and so movements in AD will
affect the price level, but have little impact on output. The
intermediate zone in the middle of the SRAS curve is upward-sloping, so
a rise in AD will cause higher output and price level, while a fall in
AD will lead to a lower output and price level.

    REVIEW QUESTIONS

      

16. What is Say’s law?

17. What is Keynes’ law?

18. Do neoclassical economists believe in Keynes’ law or Say’s law?

    curve on its far left.

25. Briefly explain the reason for the near-vertical shape of the SRAS
    curve on its far right.

27. Name some factors that could cause the SRAS curve to shift, and say
    whether they would shift SRAS to the right or to the left.

28. Will the shift of SRAS to the right tend to make the equilibrium
    quantity and price level higher or lower? What about a shift of SRAS
    to the left?

    quantity and price level higher or lower? What about a shift of AD
    to the left?

      

    CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS

      

    1.  Why would an economist choose either the neoclassical
        perspective or the Keynesian perspective, but not both?

    2.  On a microeconomic demand curve, a decrease in price causes an
        increase in quantity demanded because the product in question is
        now relatively less expensive than substitute products. Explain
        why aggregate demand does not increase for the same reason in
        response to a decrease in the aggregate price level. In other
        words, what causes total spending to increase if it is not
        because goods are now cheaper?

    3.  Economists expect that as the labor market continues to tighten
        going into the latter part of 2015 that workers should begin to
        expect wage increases in 2015 and 2016. Assuming this occurs and
        it was the only development in the labor market that year, how
        would this affect the AS curve? What if it was also accompanied
        by an increase in worker productivity?

32. How is long-term growth illustrated in an AD/AS model?

33. How is recession illustrated in an AD/AS model?

34. How is cyclical unemployment illustrated in an AD/AS model?

35. How is the natural rate of unemployment illustrated in an AD/AS
    model?

36. How is pressure for inflationary price increases shown in an AD/AS
    model?

37. What are some of the ways in which exports and imports can affect
    the AD/AS model?

38. What is the Keynesian zone of the SRAS curve? How much is the price
    level likely to change in the Keynesian zone?

39. What is the neoclassical zone of the SRAS curve? How much is the
    output level likely to change in the neoclassical zone?

40. What is the intermediate zone of the SRAS curve? Will a rise in
    output be accompanied by a rise or a fall in the price level in this
    zone?

  

1.  If new government regulations require firms to use a cleaner
    technology that is also less efficient than what they previously
    used, what would the effect be on output, the price level, and
    employment using the AD/ AS diagram?

2.  During spring 2016 the Midwestern United States, which has a large
    agricultural base, experiences above- average rainfall. Using the
    AD/AS diagram, what is the effect on output, the price level, and
    employment?

3.  Hydraulic fracturing (fracking) has the potential to significantly
    increase the amount of natural gas produced in the United States. If
    a large percentage of factories and utility companies use natural
    gas, what will happen to output, the price level, and employment as
    fracking becomes more widely used?

4.  Some politicians have suggested tying the minimum wage to the
    consumer price index (CPI). Using the AD/AS diagram, what effects
    would this policy most likely have on output, the price level, and
    employment?

      

5.  If households decide to save a larger portion of their income, what
    effect would this have on the output, employment, and price level in
    the short run? What about the long run?

6.  If firms become more optimistic about the future of the economy and,
    at the same time, innovation in 3-D printing makes most workers more
    productive, what is the combined effect on output, employment, and
    the price-level?

7.  If Congress cuts taxes at the same time that businesses become more
    pessimistic about the economy, what is the combined effect on
    output, the price level, and employment using the AD/AS diagram?

8.  Suppose the level of structural unemployment increases. How would
    you illustrate the increase in structural unemployment in the AD/AS
    model? *Hint*: How does structural unemployment affect potential
    GDP?

9.  If foreign wealth-holders decide that the United States is the
    safest place to invest their savings, what would the effect be on
    the economy here? Show graphically using the AD/AS model.

10. The AD/AS model is static. It shows a snapshot of the economy at a
    given point in time. Both economic growth and inflation are dynamic
    phenomena. Suppose economic growth is 3% per year and aggregate
    demand is growing at the same rate. What does the AD/AS model say
    the inflation rate should be?

11. Explain why the short-run aggregate supply curve might be fairly
    flat in the Keynesian zone of the SRAS curve. How might we tell if
    we are in the Keynesian zone of the AS?

12. Explain why the short-run aggregate supply curve might be vertical
    in the neoclassical zone of the SRAS curve. How might we tell if we
    are in the neoclassical zone of the AS?

13. Why might it be important for policymakers to know which in zone of
    the SRAS curve the economy is?

14. In your view, is the economy currently operating in the Keynesian,
    intermediate or neoclassical portion of the economy’s aggregate
    supply curve?

15. Are Say’s law and Keynes’ law necessarily mutually exclusive?

The Great Recession

The 2008-2009 Great Recession hit the U.S. economy hard. According to
the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the number of unemployed Americans
rose from 6.8 million in May 2007 to 15.4 million in October 2009.
During that time, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated that approximately
170,000 small businesses closed. Mass layoffs peaked in February 2009
when employers gave 326,392 workers notice. U.S. productivity and output
fell as well. Job losses, declining home values, declining incomes, and
uncertainty about the future caused consumption expenditures to
decrease. According to the BLS, household spending dropped by 7.8%.

Home foreclosures and the meltdown in U.S. financial markets called for
immediate action by Congress, the President, and the Federal Reserve
Bank. For example, the government implemented programs such as the
American Restoration and Recovery Act to help millions of people by
providing tax credits for homebuyers, paying “cash for clunkers,” and
extending unemployment benefits. From cutting back on spending, filing
for unemployment, and losing homes, millions of people were affected by
the recession. While the United States is now on the path to recovery,
people will feel the impact for many years to come.

What caused this recession and what prevented the economy from spiraling
further into another depression? Policymakers looked to the lessons
learned from the 1930s Great Depression and to John Maynard Keynes'
models to analyze the causes and find solutions to the country’s
economic woes. The Keynesian perspective is the subject of this chapter.

<a href="#bookmark952" class="s34">We have learned that the level of economic activity, for example output, employment, and spending, tends to grow over time. In</a>

<a href="#bookmark432" class="a">The Macroeconomic Perspective</a>
<a href="#bookmark953" class="s34">pointed out that the economy tends to cycle around the long-run trend. In other words, the economy does not always grow at its average growth rate. Sometimes economic activity grows at the trend rate, sometimes it grows more than the trend, sometimes it grows less than the trend, and sometimes it actually declines. You can see this cyclical behavior in</a>

    style=" color: #3767B1;">Aggregate Demand in Keynesian
    Analysis</span><span id="bookmark954">‌</span>

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Explain real GDP, recessionary gaps, and inflationary gaps

    -   Recognize the Keynesian AD/AS model

    -   Identify the determining factors of both consumption expenditure
        and investment expenditure

    -   Analyze the factors that determine government spending and net
        exports

          

        <span id="bookmark955">The Keynesian perspective focuses on
        aggregate demand. The idea is simple: firms produce output only
        if they expect it to sell. Thus, while the availability of the
        factors of production determines a nation’s potential GDP, the
        amount of</span>

          

          

        <span id="bookmark956">goods and services that actually sell,
        known as</span> **real GDP**, depends on how much demand exists
        across the economy.

        <a href="#bookmark957" class="a">Figure 12.3</a> <span
        class="p">illustrates this point.</span>

          

        <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_264.jpg" width="224" height="179" alt="image" />

        <span id="bookmark957">Figure 12.3 The Keynesian AD/AS
        Model</span> <span class="s37">The Keynesian View of the AD/AS
        Model uses an SRAS curve, which is horizontal at levels of
        output below potential and vertical at potential output. Thus,
        when beginning from potential output, any decrease in AD affects
        only output, but not prices. Any increase in AD affects only
        prices, not output.</span>

          

        <span id="bookmark958">Keynes argued that, for reasons we
        explain shortly, aggregate demand is not stable—that it can
        change unexpectedly. Suppose the economy starts where AD
        intersects SRAS at P</span><span class="s60">0</span> and Yp.
        Because Yp is potential output, the economy is at full
        employment. Because AD is volatile, it can easily fall. Thus,
        even if we start at Yp, if AD falls, then we find ourselves in
        what Keynes termed a **recessionary gap**. The economy is in
        equilibrium but with less than full employment, as Y<span
        class="s60">1</span> <a href="#bookmark957" class="s34">in</a>
        <a href="#bookmark957" class="a">Figure 12.3</a><span
        class="s54"> </span>shows. Keynes believed that the economy
        would tend to stay in a recessionary gap, with its attendant
        unemployment, for a significant period of time.

        <span id="bookmark959">In the same way (although we do not show
        it in the figure), if AD increases, the economy could experience
        an</span> **inflationary gap**, where demand is attempting to
        push the economy past potential output. Consequently, the
        economy experiences inflation. The key policy implication for
        either situation is that government needs to step in and close
        the gap, increasing spending during recessions and decreasing
        spending during booms to return aggregate demand to match
        potential output.

        <a href="#bookmark856" id="bookmark960" class="s34">Recall from</a>
        <a href="#bookmark856" class="a">The Aggregate Supply-Aggregate Demand</a>
        Model
        <a href="#bookmark1788" class="s34">that aggregate demand is total spending, economy-wide, on domestic goods and services. (Aggregate demand (AD) is actually what economists call total planned expenditure. Read the appendix on</a>
        <a href="#bookmark1788" class="a">The Expenditure-Output Model</a>
        <span class="p">for more on this.) You may also remember that
        aggregate demand is the sum of four components: consumption
        expenditure, investment expenditure, government spending, and
        spending on net exports (exports minus imports). In the
        following sections, we will examine each component through the
        Keynesian perspective.</span>

        What Determines Consumption Expenditure?

        <a href="#bookmark432" id="bookmark961" class="s34">Consumption expenditure is spending by households and individuals on durable goods, nondurable goods, and services. Durable goods are items that last and provide value over time, such as automobiles. Nondurable goods are things like groceries—once you consume them, they are gone. Recall from</a>
        <a href="#bookmark432" class="a">The Macroeconomic</a>
        Perspective <span class="p">that services are intangible things
        consumers buy, like healthcare or entertainment.</span>

        Keynes identified three factors that affect consumption:

    -   <span id="bookmark962">Disposable income: For most people, the
        single most powerful determinant of how much they consume is how
        much income they have in their take-home pay, also known
        as</span> **disposable income**, which is income after taxes.

    -   Expected future income: Consumer expectations about future
        income also are important in determining consumption. If
        consumers feel optimistic about the future, they are more likely
        to spend and increase overall aggregate demand. News of
        recession and troubles in the economy will make them pull back
        on consumption.

    -   Wealth or credit: When households experience a rise in wealth,
        they may be willing to consume a higher share of their income
        and to save less. When the U.S. stock market rose dramatically
        in the late 1990s, for example,

        U.S. savings rates declined, probably in part because people
        felt that their wealth had increased and there was less need to
        save. How do people spend beyond their income, when they
        perceive their wealth increasing? The answer is borrowing. On
        the other side, when the U.S. stock market declined about 40%
        from March 2008 to

          

          

        March 2009, people felt far greater uncertainty about their
        economic future, so savings rates increased while consumption
        declined.

        style=" color: #000;">for more information about how the
        recession affected various groups of people.</span>

        Finally, Keynes noted that a variety of other factors combine to
        determine how much people save and spend. If household
        preferences about saving shift in a way that encourages
        consumption rather than saving, then AD will shift out to the
        right.

          

          

        What Determines Investment Expenditure?

        <span id="bookmark963">We call spending on new capital goods
        investment expenditure. Investment falls into four categories:
        producer’s durable equipment and software, nonresidential
        structures (such as factories, offices, and retail locations),
        changes in inventories, and residential structures (such as
        single-family homes, townhouses, and apartment buildings).
        Businesses conduct the first three types of investment, while
        households conduct the last.</span>

        Keynes’s treatment of investment focuses on the key role of
        expectations about the future in influencing business decisions.
        When a business decides to make an investment in physical
        assets, like plants or equipment, or in intangible assets, like
        skills or a research and development project, that firm
        considers both the expected investment benefits (future profit
        expectations) and the investment costs (interest rates).

    -   Expectations of future profits: The clearest driver of
        investment benefits is expectations for future profits. When we
        expect an economy to grow, businesses perceive a growing market
        for their products. Their higher degree of business confidence
        will encourage new investment. For example, in the second half
        of the 1990s,

        U.S. investment levels surged from 18% of GDP in 1994 to 21%
        in 2000. However, when a recession started in 2001, U.S.
        investment levels quickly sank back to 18% of GDP by 2002.

    -   <span id="bookmark964">Interest rates also play a significant
        role in determining how much investment a firm will make. Just
        as individuals need to borrow money to purchase homes, so
        businesses need financing when they purchase big ticket items.
        The cost of investment thus includes the interest rate. Even if
        the firm has the funds, the interest rate measures the
        opportunity cost of purchasing business capital. Lower interest
        rates stimulate investment spending and higher interest rates
        reduce it.</span>

    Many factors can affect the expected profitability on investment.
    For example, if the energy prices decline, then investments that use
    energy as an input will yield higher profits. If government offers
    special incentives for investment (for example, through the tax
    code), then investment will look more attractive; conversely, if
    government removes special investment incentives from the tax code,
    or increases other business taxes, then investment will look less
    attractive. As Keynes noted, business investment is the most
    variable of all the components of aggregate demand.

    What Determines Government Spending?

    <a href="http://cnx.org/content/m63688/latest/" class="s34">The third component of aggregate demand is federal, state, and local government spending. Although we usually view the United States as a market economy, government still plays a significant role in the economy. As we discuss in</a>
    <a href="http://cnx.org/content/m63688/latest/" class="a">Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities (http://cnx.org/content/m63688/latest/)</a>
    <a href="http://cnx.org/content/m63697/latest/" class="s34">and</a>
    <a href="http://cnx.org/content/m63697/latest/" class="a">Positive Externalitites and Public Goods (http://cnx.org/content/m63697/latest/)</a>
    <span class="p">, government provides important public services such
    as national defense, transportation infrastructure, and
    education.</span>

      

      

    Keynes recognized that the government budget offered a powerful tool
    for influencing aggregate demand. Not only could more government
    spending stimulate AD (or less government spending reduce it), but
    lowering or raising tax rates could influence consumption and
    investment spending. Keynes concluded that during extreme times like
    deep recessions, only the government had the power and resources to
    move aggregate demand.

    What Determines Net Exports?

    <span id="bookmark965">Recall that exports are domestically produced
    products that sell abroad while imports are foreign produced
    products that consumers purchase domestically. Since we define
    aggregate demand as spending on domestic goods and services, export
    expenditures add to AD, while import expenditures subtract from
    AD.</span>

    Two sets of factors can cause shifts in export and import demand:
    changes in relative growth rates between countries and changes in
    relative prices between countries. What is happening in the
    countries' economies that would be purchasing those exports heavily
    affects the level of demand for a nation's exports. For example, if
    major importers of American-made products like Canada, Japan, and
    Germany have recessions, exports of U.S. products to those countries
    are likely to decline. Conversely, the amount of income in the
    domestic economy directly affects the quantity of a nation's
    imports: more income will bring a higher level of imports.

    Relative prices of goods in domestic and international markets can
    also affect exports and imports. If U.S. goods are relatively
    cheaper compared with goods made in other places, perhaps because a
    group of U.S. producers has mastered certain productivity
    breakthroughs, then U.S. exports are likely to rise. If U.S. goods
    become relatively more expensive, perhaps because a change in the
    exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and other currencies has
    pushed up the price of inputs to production in the United States,
    then exports from U.S. producers are likely to decline.

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Evaluate the Keynesian view of recessions through an
        understanding of sticky wages and prices and the importance of
        aggregate demand

    -   Explain the coordination argument, menu costs, and macroeconomic
        externality

    -   Analyze the impact of the expenditure multiplier

      

    <a href="#bookmark1788" class="s34">Now that we have a clear understanding of what constitutes aggregate demand, we return to the Keynesian argument using the model of aggregate demand/aggregate supply (AD/AS). (For a similar treatment using Keynes’ income- expenditure model, see the appendix on</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1788" class="a">The Expenditure-Output</a>
    Model<span class="p">.)</span>

    <span id="bookmark968">Keynesian economics focuses on explaining why
    recessions and depressions occur and offering a policy prescription
    for minimizing their effects. The Keynesian view of recession is
    based on two key building blocks. First, aggregate demand is not
    always automatically high enough to provide firms with an incentive
    to hire enough workers to reach full employment. Second, the
    macroeconomy may adjust only slowly to shifts in aggregate demand
    because of</span> **sticky wages and prices**, which are wages and
    prices that do not respond to decreases or increases in demand. We
    will consider these two claims in turn, and then see how they are
    represented in the AD/AS model.<span id="bookmark969">‌</span>

    The first building block of the Keynesian diagnosis is that
    recessions occur when the level of demand for goods and services is
    less than what is produced when labor is fully employed. In other
    words, the intersection of aggregate supply and aggregate demand
    occurs at a level of output less than the level of GDP consistent
    with full employment. Suppose the stock market crashes, as in 1929,
    or suppose the housing market collapses, as in 2008. In either case,
    household wealth will decline, and consumption expenditure will
    follow. Suppose businesses see that consumer spending is falling.
    That will reduce expectations of the profitability of investment, so
    businesses will decrease investment expenditure.

    This seemed to be the case during the Great Depression, since the
    physical capacity of the economy to supply goods did not alter much.
    No flood or earthquake or other natural disaster ruined factories in
    1929 or 1930. No outbreak of disease decimated the ranks of workers.
    No key input price, like the price of oil, soared on world markets.
    The U.S. economy in 1933 had just about the same factories, workers,
    and state of technology as it had had four years earlier in 1929—and
    yet the economy had shrunk dramatically. This also seems to be what
    happened in 2008.

    GDP.</span>

    As Keynes recognized, the events of the Depression contradicted
    Say’s law that “supply creates its own demand.” Although production
    capacity existed, the markets were not able to sell their products.
    As a result, real GDP was less than potential GDP.

      

      

    Wage and Price Stickiness

    Keynes also pointed out that although AD fluctuated, prices and
    wages did not immediately respond as economists often expected.
    Instead, prices and wages are “sticky,” making it difficult to
    restore the economy to full employment

      

      

    <span id="bookmark970">and potential GDP. Keynes emphasized one
    particular reason why wages were sticky: the</span> **coordination
    argument**<a href="#bookmark619" class="s34">. This argument points out that, even if most people would be willing—at least hypothetically—to see a decline in their own wages in bad economic times as long as everyone else also experienced such a decline, a market-oriented economy has no obvious way to implement a plan of coordinated wage reductions.</a>
    <a href="#bookmark619" class="a">Unemployment</a><span class="s54">
    </span>proposed a number of reasons why wages might be sticky
    downward, most of which center on the argument that businesses avoid
    wage cuts because they may in one way or another depress morale and
    hurt the productivity of the existing workers.

    <span id="bookmark971">Some modern economists have argued in a
    Keynesian spirit that, along with wages, other prices may be sticky,
    too. Many firms do not change their prices every day or even every
    month. When a firm considers changing prices, it must consider two
    sets of costs. First, changing prices uses company resources:
    managers must analyze the competition and market demand and decide
    the new prices, they must update sales materials, change billing
    records, and redo product and price labels. Second, frequent price
    changes may leave customers confused or angry—especially if they
    discover that a product now costs more than they expected. These
    costs of changing prices are called</span> **menu costs**—like the
    costs of printing a new set of menus with different prices in a
    restaurant. Prices do respond to forces of supply and demand, but
    from a macroeconomic perspective, the process of changing all prices
    throughout the economy takes time.

    <a href="#bookmark972" class="s34">To understand the effect of sticky wages and prices in the economy, consider</a>

    occurs at the intersection of the demand curve (D<span

    class="s60">0</span>). When aggregate demand declines, the demand
    for labor shifts to the left (to D<span

    <a href="#bookmark972" class="a">Figure 12.4</a><span class="s54">

    </span>(b). However, because of sticky wages and prices, the wage
    remains at its original level (W<span class="s60">0</span>) for a
    period of time and the price remains at its original level (P<span
    class="s60">0</span>).

    As a result, a situation of excess supply—where the quantity
    supplied exceeds the quantity demanded at the existing wage or
    price—exists in markets for both labor and goods, and Q<span

        the economy find themselves in this position, the economy is in
        a recession; that is, firms cannot sell what they wish to
        produce at the existing market price and do not wish to hire all
        who are willing to work at the existing market wage. The Clear
        It Up feature discusses this problem in more detail.

        </span></span>In both (a) and (b), demand shifts left from
        D<span class="s63">0</span> to D<span class="s63">1</span>.
        However, the wage in (a) and the price in (b) do not immediately

        (D<span class="s63">1</span>), it will be Q<span
        class="s63">1</span>.

        Similarly, in (b), the quantity demanded of goods at the
        original price (P<span class="s63">0</span>) is Q<span
        class="s63">0</span>, but at the new demand curve (D<span
        class="s63">1</span>) it will be Q<span class="s63">1</span>. An
        excess supply of labor will exist, which we call unemployment.
        An excess supply of goods will also exist, where the quantity
        demanded is substantially less than the quantity supplied. Thus,
        sticky wages and sticky prices, combined with a drop in demand,
        bring about unemployment and recession.

        Why Is the Pace of Wage Adjustments Slow?

        The recovery after the Great Recession in the United States has
        been slow, with wages stagnant, if not declining. In fact, many
        low-wage workers at McDonalds, Dominos, and Walmart have
        threatened to strike for higher wages. Their plight is part of a
        larger trend in job growth and pay in the post–recession
        recovery.

          

        <span id="bookmark973">Figure 12.5 Jobs Lost/Gained in the
        Recession/Recovery</span> <span class="s37">Data in the
        aftermath of the Great Recession suggests that jobs lost were in
        mid-wage occupations, while jobs gained were in low-wage
        occupations.</span>

          

        <a href="#bookmark973" class="s84">The National Employment Law Project compiled data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and found that, during the Great Recession, 60% of job losses were in medium-wage occupations. Most of them were replaced during the recovery period with lower-wage jobs in the service, retail, and food industries.</a>
        <a href="#bookmark973" class="s43">Figure</a>

    2.  illustrates this data.

Wages in the service, retail, and food industries are at or near minimum
wage and tend to be both downwardly and upwardly “sticky.” Wages are
downwardly sticky due to minimum wage laws. They may be upwardly sticky
if insufficient competition in low-skilled labor markets enables
employers to avoid raising wages that would reduce their profits. At the
same time, however, the Consumer Price Index increased 11% between 2007
and 2012, pushing real wages down.

  

The Two Keynesian Assumptions in the AD/AS Model

<a href="#bookmark975" id="bookmark974" class="a">Figure 12.6</a>
<a href="#bookmark975" class="s34">is the AD/AS diagram which illustrates these two Keynesian assumptions—the importance of aggregate demand in causing recession and the stickiness of wages and prices. Note that because of the stickiness of wages and prices, the aggregate supply curve is flatter than either supply curve (labor or specific good). In fact, if wages and prices were so sticky that they did not fall at all, the aggregate supply curve would be completely flat below potential GDP, as</a>
<a href="#bookmark975" class="a">Figure 12.6</a> <span class="p">shows.
This outcome is an important example of a </span><span
class="s31">macroeconomic externality</span><span class="p">, where what
happens at the macro level is different from and inferior to what
happens at the micro level. For example, a firm should respond to a
decrease in demand for its product by cutting its price to increase
sales. However, if all firms experience a decrease in demand for their
products, sticky prices in the aggregate prevent aggregate demand from
rebounding (which we would show as a movement along the AD curve in
response to a lower price level).</span>

The original equilibrium of this economy occurs where the aggregate
demand function (AD<span class="s60">0</span>) intersects with AS. Since
this intersection occurs at potential GDP (Yp), the economy is operating
at full employment. When aggregate

  

  

demand shifts to the left, all the adjustment occurs through decreased
real GDP. There is no decrease in the price level. Since the equilibrium
occurs at Y<span class="s60">1</span>, the economy experiences
substantial unemployment.

  

<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_269.jpg" width="224" height="179" alt="image" />

<span id="bookmark975"><span class="s36">Figure 12.6 A Keynesian
Perspective of Recession </span></span>This figure illustrates the two
key assumptions behind Keynesian economics. A recession begins when
aggregate demand declines from AD<span class="s63">0</span> to AD<span
class="s63">1</span>. The recession persists because of the assumption
of fixed wages and prices, which makes the SRAS flat below potential
GDP. If that were not the case, the price level would fall also, raising
GDP and limiting the recession. Instead the intersection E<span
class="s63">1</span> occurs in the flat portion of the SRAS curve where
GDP is less than potential.

  

The Expenditure Multiplier

<span id="bookmark976">A key concept in Keynesian economics is
the</span> **expenditure multiplier**. The expenditure multiplier is the
idea that not only does spending affect the equilibrium level of GDP,
but that spending is powerful. More precisely, it means that a change in
spending causes a more than proportionate change in GDP.

&gt; 1

      ΔY      <span class="s16"> ΔSpending</span>

<a href="#bookmark1788" id="bookmark977" class="s34">The reason for the expenditure multiplier is that one person’s spending becomes another person’s income, which leads to additional spending and additional income so that the cumulative impact on GDP is larger than the initial increase in spending. The appendix on</a>
<a href="#bookmark1788" class="a">The Expenditure-Output Model</a> <span
class="p">provides the details of the multiplier process, but the
concept is important enough for us to summarize here. While the
multiplier is important for understanding the effectiveness of fiscal
policy, it occurs whenever any autonomous increase in spending occurs.
Additionally, the multiplier operates in a negative as well as a
positive direction. Thus, when investment spending collapsed during the
Great Depression, it caused a much larger decrease in real GDP. The size
of the multiplier is critical and was a key element in discussions of
the effectiveness of the Obama administration’s fiscal stimulus package,
officially titled the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of
2009.</span>

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Explain the Phillips curve, noting its impact on the theories of
        Keynesian economics

    -   Graph a Phillips curve

    -   Identify factors that cause the instability of the Phillips

    -   Analyze the Keynesian policy for reducing unemployment and
        inflation

          

        <a href="#bookmark979" class="s34">The simplified AD/AS model that we have used so far is fully consistent with Keynes’s original model. More recent research, though, has indicated that in the real world, an aggregate supply curve is more curved than the right angle that we used in this chapter. Rather, the real-world AS curve is very flat at levels of output far below potential (“the Keynesian zone”), very steep at levels of output above potential (“the neoclassical zone”) and curved in between (“the intermediate zone”).</a>
        <a href="#bookmark979" class="a">Figure 12.7</a> <span
        class="p">illustrates this. The typical aggregate supply curve
        leads to the concept of the Phillips curve.</span>

        the SRAS curve's far left, small shifts in AD, either to the
        right or the left, will affect the output level Yk, but will not
        much affect the price level. In the Keynesian zone, AD largely
        determines the quantity of output. Near the equilibrium En, in
        the neoclassical zone, at the SRAS curve's far right, small
        shifts in AD, either to the right or the left, will have
        relatively little effect on the output level Yn, but instead
        will have a greater effect on the price level. In the
        neoclassical zone, the near-vertical SRAS curve close to the
        level of potential GDP (as represented by the LRAS line) largely
        determines the quantity of output. In the intermediate zone
        around equilibrium Ei, movement in AD to the right will increase
        both the output level and the price level, while a movement in

        The Discovery of the Phillips Curve

        <span id="bookmark980">In the 1950s, A.W. Phillips, an economist
        at the London School of Economics, was studying the Keynesian
        analytical framework. The Keynesian theory implied that during a
        recession inflationary pressures are low, but when the level of
        output is at or even pushing beyond potential GDP, the economy
        is at greater risk for inflation. Phillips analyzed 60 years of
        British data and did find that tradeoff between unemployment and
        inflation, which became known as the</span> **Phillips
        curve**<a href="#bookmark982" class="s34">.</a>

        Over this longer period of time, the Phillips curve appears to
        have shifted out. There is no tradeoff any more.

        <span id="bookmark985">The Instability of the Phillips
        Curve</span>

        During the 1960s, economists viewed the Phillips curve as a
        policy menu. A nation could choose low inflation and high
        unemployment, or high inflation and low unemployment, or
        anywhere in between. Economies could use fiscal and monetary
        policy to move up or down the Phillips curve as desired. Then a
        curious thing happened. When policymakers tried to exploit the
        tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, the result was an
        increase in both inflation and unemployment. What had happened?
        The Phillips curve shifted.

        <a href="#bookmark856" id="bookmark986" class="s34">The U.S. economy experienced this pattern in the deep recession from 1973 to 1975, and again in back-to-back recessions from 1980 to 1982. Many nations around the world saw similar increases in unemployment and inflation. This pattern became known as stagflation. (Recall from</a>
        <a href="#bookmark856" class="a">The Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply</a>
        Model <span class="p">that stagflation is an unhealthy
        combination of high unemployment and high inflation.) Perhaps
        most important, stagflation was a phenomenon that traditional
        Keynesian economics could not explain.</span>

        <span id="bookmark987">Economists have concluded that two
        factors cause the Phillips curve to shift. The first is supply
        shocks, like the mid-1970s oil crisis, which first brought
        stagflation into our vocabulary. The second is changes in
        people’s expectations about inflation. In other words, there may
        be a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment when people
        expect no inflation, but when they realize inflation is
        occurring, the tradeoff disappears. Both factors (supply shocks
        and changes in inflationary expectations) cause the aggregate
        supply curve, and thus the Phillips curve, to shift.</span>

        In short, we should interpret a downward-sloping Phillips curve
        as valid for short-run periods of several years, but over longer
        periods, when aggregate supply shifts, the downward-sloping
        Phillips curve can shift so that unemployment and inflation are
        both higher (as in the 1970s and early 1980s) or both lower (as
        in the early 1990s or first decade of the 2000s).

        Keynesian Policy for Fighting Unemployment and Inflation

        <span id="bookmark988">Keynesian macroeconomics argues that the
        solution to a recession is</span> **expansionary fiscal
        policy**<a href="#bookmark990" class="s34">, such as tax cuts to stimulate consumption and investment, or direct increases in government spending that would shift the aggregate demand curve to the right. For example, if aggregate demand was originally at ADr in</a>
        <a href="#bookmark990" class="a">Figure</a> <span
        class="s54">12.11</span>, so that the economy was in recession,
        the appropriate policy would be for government to shift
        aggregate demand to the right from ADr to ADf, where the economy
        would be at potential GDP and full employment.

        Keynes noted that while it would be nice if the government could
        spend additional money on housing, roads, and other amenities,
        he also argued that if the government could not agree on how to
        spend money in practical ways, then it could spend in
        impractical ways. For example, Keynes suggested building
        monuments, like a modern

          

          

        <span id="bookmark989">equivalent of the Egyptian pyramids. He
        proposed that the government could bury money underground, and
        let mining companies start digging up the money again. These
        suggestions were slightly tongue-in-cheek, but their purpose was
        to emphasize that a Great Depression is no time to quibble over
        the specifics of government spending programs and tax cuts when
        the goal should be to pump up aggregate demand by enough to lift
        the economy to potential GDP.</span>

        <span id="bookmark990">Figure 12.11 Fighting Recession and
        Inflation with Keynesian Policy</span> <span class="s37">If an
        economy is in recession, with an equilibrium at Er, then the
        Keynesian response would be to enact a policy to shift aggregate
        demand to the right from ADr toward ADf. If an economy is
        experiencing inflationary pressures with an equilibrium at Ei,
        then the Keynesian response would be to enact a policy response
        to shift aggregate demand to the left, from ADi toward
        ADf.</span>

          

        <span id="bookmark991">The other side of Keynesian policy occurs
        when the economy is operating above potential GDP. In this
        situation, unemployment is low, but inflationary rises in the

        be</span> **contractionary fiscal
        policy**<a href="#bookmark990" class="s34">, using tax increases or government spending cuts to shift AD to the left.

        would be for government to shift aggregate demand to the left,
        from ADi toward ADf, which reduces the pressure for a higher
        price level while the economy remains at full employment.

        In the Keynesian economic model, too little aggregate demand
        brings unemployment and too much brings inflation. Thus, you can
        think of Keynesian economics as pursuing a “Goldilocks” level of
        aggregate demand: not too much, not too little, but looking for
        what is just right.

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Explain the Keynesian perspective on market forces

    -   Analyze the role of government policy in economic management

  

Ever since the birth of Keynesian economics in the 1930s, controversy
has simmered over the extent to which government should play an active
role in managing the economy. In the aftermath of the human devastation
and misery of the Great Depression, many people—including many
economists—became more aware of vulnerabilities within the
market-oriented economic system. Some supporters of Keynesian economics
advocated a high degree of government planning in all parts of the
economy.

  

  

However, Keynes himself was careful to separate the issue of aggregate
demand from the issue of how well individual markets worked. He argued
that individual markets for goods and services were appropriate and
useful, but that sometimes that level of aggregate demand was just too
low. When 10 million people are willing and able to work, but one
million of them are unemployed, he argued, individual markets may be
doing a perfectly good job of allocating the efforts of the nine million
workers—the problem is that insufficient aggregate demand exists to
support jobs for all 10 million. Thus, he believed that, while
government should ensure that overall level of aggregate demand is
sufficient for an economy to reach full employment, this task did not
imply that the government should attempt to set prices and wages
throughout the economy, nor to take over and manage large corporations
or entire industries directly.

The Great Recession

The lessons learned during the 1930s Great Depression and the aggregate
expenditure model that John Maynard Keynes proposed gave the modern
economists and policymakers of today the tools to effectively navigate
the treacherous economy in the latter half of the 2000s. In “How the
Great Recession Was Brought to an End", Alan S. Blinder and Mark Zandi
wrote that the actions taken by today’s policymakers stand in sharp
contrast to those of the early years of the Great Depression. Today’s
economists and policymakers were not content to let the markets recover
from recession without taking proactive measures to support consumption
and investment. The Federal Reserve actively lowered short-term interest
rates and developed innovative ways to pump money into the economy so
that credit and investment would not dry up. Both Presidents Bush and
Obama and Congress implemented a variety of programs ranging from tax
rebates to “Cash for Clunkers” to the Troubled Asset Relief Program to
stimulate and stabilize household consumption and encourage investment.
Although these policies came under harsh criticism from the public and
many politicians, they lessened the impact of the economic downturn and
may have saved the country from a second Great Depression.

<a href="#bookmark1384" class="s34">Even if one accepts the Keynesian economic theory, a number of practical questions remain. In the real world, can government economists identify potential GDP accurately? Is a desired increase in aggregate demand better accomplished by a tax cut or by an increase in government spending? Given the inevitable delays and uncertainties as governments enact policies into law, is it reasonable to expect that the government can implement Keynesian economics? Can fixing a recession really be just as simple as pumping up aggregate demand?</a>

KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY

  

1.  <a href="#bookmark954" class="a">Aggregate Demand in Keynesian</a>
    [Analysis](#bookmark954)

    Aggregate demand is the sum of four components: consumption,
    investment, government spending, and net exports. Consumption will
    change for a number of reasons, including movements in income,
    taxes, expectations about future income, and changes in wealth
    levels. Investment will change in response to its expected
    profitability, which in turn is shaped by expectations about future
    economic growth, the creation of new technologies, the price of key
    inputs, and tax incentives for investment. Investment will also
    change when interest rates rise or fall. Political considerations
    determine government spending and taxes. Exports and imports change
    according to relative growth rates and prices between two economies.

      

2.  <a href="#bookmark967" class="a">The Building Blocks of Keynesian</a>
    [Analysis](#bookmark967)

    Keynesian economics is based on two main ideas: (1) aggregate demand
    is more likely than aggregate supply to be the primary cause of a
    short-run economic event like a recession; (2) wages and prices can
    be sticky, and so, in an economic downturn, unemployment can result.
    The latter is an example of a macroeconomic externality. While
    surpluses cause prices to fall at the micro level, they do not
    necessarily at the macro level. Instead the adjustment to a decrease
    in demand occurs only through decreased quantities. One reason why
    prices may be sticky is menu costs, the costs of changing prices.
    These include internal costs a business faces in changing prices in
    terms of labeling, recordkeeping, and accounting, and also the costs
    of communicating the price change to (possibly unhappy) customers.
    Keynesians also believe in the existence of the expenditure
    multiplier—the notion that a change in autonomous expenditure causes
    a more than proportionate change in GDP.

      

3.  <a href="#bookmark978" class="a">The Phillips</a>
    [Curve](#bookmark978)

    A Phillips curve shows the tradeoff between unemployment and
    inflation in an economy. From a Keynesian viewpoint, the Phillips
    curve should slope down so that higher unemployment means lower
    inflation, and vice versa. However, a downward-sloping Phillips
    curve is a short-term relationship that may shift after a few years.

    Keynesian macroeconomics argues that the solution to a recession is
    expansionary fiscal policy, such as tax cuts to stimulate
    consumption and investment, or direct increases in government
    spending that would shift the aggregate demand curve to the right.
    The other side of Keynesian policy occurs when the economy is
    operating above potential GDP. In this situation, unemployment is
    low, but inflationary rises in the price level are a concern. The
    Keynesian response would be contractionary fiscal policy, using tax
    increases or government spending cuts to shift AD to the left.

      

4.  <a href="#bookmark992" class="a">The Keynesian Perspective on Market</a>
    [Forces](#bookmark992)

The Keynesian prescription for stabilizing the economy implies
government intervention at the macroeconomic level—increasing aggregate
demand when private demand falls and decreasing aggregate demand when
private demand rises. This does not imply that the government should be
passing laws or regulations that set prices and quantities in
microeconomic markets.

Navigating Unchartered Waters

The Great Recession ended in June 2009 after 18 months, according to the
National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). The NBER examines a variety
of measures of economic activity to gauge the economy's overall health.
These measures include real income, wholesale and retail sales,
employment, and industrial production. In the years since the official
end of this historic economic downturn, it has become clear that the
Great Recession was two-pronged, hitting the U.S. economy with the
collapse of the housing market and the failure of the financial system's
credit institutions, further contaminating global economies. While the
stock market rapidly lost trillions of dollars of value, consumer
spending dried up, and companies began cutting jobs, economic
policymakers were struggling with how to best combat and prevent a
national, and even global economic collapse. In the end, policymakers
used a number of controversial monetary and fiscal policies to support
the housing market and domestic industries as well as to stabilize the
financial sector. Some of these initiatives included:

-   Federal Reserve Bank purchase of both traditional and nontraditional
    assets off banks' balance sheets. By doing this, the Fed injected
    money into the banking system and increased the amounts of funds
    available to lend to the business sector and consumers. This also
    dropped short-term interest rates to as low as zero percent, which
    had the effect of devaluing U.S. dollars in the global market and
    boosting exports.

-   The Congress and the President also passed several pieces of
    legislation that would stabilize the

areas of the economy that impact our daily lives. One of the most

financial market. The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), passed in
late 2008, allowed the government to inject cash into troubled banks and
other financial institutions and help support General Motors and
Chrysler as they faced bankruptcy and threatened job losses throughout
their supply chain. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in early
2009 provided tax rebates to low- and middle-income households to
encourage consumer spending.

Four years after the end of the Great Recession, the economy has yet to
return to its pre-recession levels of productivity and growth. Annual
productivity increased only 1.9% between 2009 and 2012 compared to its
2.7% annual growth rate between 2000 and 2007, unemployment remains
above the natural rate, and real GDP continues to lag behind potential
growth. The actions the government has taken to stabilize the economy
are still under scrutiny and debate about their effectiveness continues.
In this chapter, we will discuss the neoclassical perspective on
economics and compare it to the Keynesian perspective. At the end of the
chapter, we will use the neoclassical perspective to analyze the actions
the government has taken in the Great Recession.

  

#### Introduction to the Neoclassical Perspective

In this chapter, you will learn about:

-   The Building Blocks of Neoclassical Analysis

-   The Policy Implications of the Neoclassical Perspective

-   Balancing Keynesian and Neoclassical Models

  

In Chicago, Illinois, the highest recorded temperature was 105° in July
1995, while the lowest recorded temperature was 27° below zero in
January 1958. Understanding why these extreme weather patterns occurred
would be interesting. However, if you wanted to understand the typical
weather pattern in Chicago, instead of focusing on one- time extremes,
you would need to look at the entire pattern of data over time.

<span id="bookmark1019">A similar lesson applies to the study of
macroeconomics. It is interesting to study extreme situations, like the
1930s Great Depression or what many have called the 2008-2009 Great
Recession. If you want to understand the whole picture, however, you
need to look at the long term. Consider the unemployment rate. The
unemployment rate has fluctuated from as low as 3.5% in 1969 to as high
as 9.7% in 1982 and 9.6% in 2009. Even as the U.S. unemployment rate
rose during recessions and declined during expansions, it kept returning
to the general neighborhood of 5.0–5.5%. When the nonpartisan
Congressional Budget Office carried out its long-range economic
forecasts in 2010, it assumed that from 2015 to 2020, after the
recession has passed, the unemployment rate would be 5.0%. From a
long-run perspective, the economy seems to keep adjusting back to this
rate of unemployment.</span>

As the name “neoclassical” implies, this perspective of how the
macroeconomy works is a “new” view of the “old” classical model of the
economy. The classical view, the predominant economic philosophy until
the Great Depression, was that short-term fluctuations in economic
activity would rather quickly, with flexible prices, adjust back to full
employment. This view of the economy implied a vertical aggregate supply
curve at full employment GDP, and prescribed a “hands off” policy
approach. For example, if the economy were to slip into recession (a
leftward shift of the aggregate demand curve), it would temporarily
exhibit a surplus of goods. Falling prices would eliminate this surplus,
and the economy would return to full employment level of GDP. No active
fiscal or monetary policy was needed. In fact, the classical view was
that expansionary fiscal or monetary policy would only cause inflation,
rather than increase GDP. The deep and lasting impact of the Great
Depression changed this thinking and Keynesian economics, which
prescribed active fiscal policy to alleviate weak aggregate demand,
became the more mainstream perspective.

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Explain the importance of potential GDP in the long run

    -   Analyze the role of flexible prices

    -   Interpret a neoclassical model of aggregate demand and aggregate
        supply

    -   Evaluate different ways for measuring the speed of macroeconomic
        adjustment

      

    <span id="bookmark1021">The</span> **neoclassical perspective** on
    macroeconomics holds that, in the long run, the economy will
    fluctuate around its potential GDP and its natural rate of
    unemployment. This chapter begins with two building blocks of
    neoclassical economics: (1) potential GDP determines the economy's
    the size and (2) wages and prices will adjust in a flexible manner
    so that the economy will adjust back to its potential GDP level of
    output. The key policy implication is this: The government should
    focus more on long-term growth and on controlling inflation than on
    worrying about recession or cyclical unemployment. This focus on
    long-run growth rather than the short-run fluctuations in the
    business cycle means that neoclassical economics is more useful for
    long-run macroeconomic analysis and Keynesian economics is more
    useful for analyzing the macroeconomic short run. Let's consider the
    two neoclassical building blocks in turn, and how we can embody them
    in the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model.<span
    id="bookmark1022">‌</span><span id="bookmark1023">‌</span>

    The Importance of Potential GDP in the Long Run

    Over the long run, the level of potential GDP determines the size of
    real GDP. When economists refer to “potential GDP” they are
    referring to that level of output that an economy can achieve when
    all resources (land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurial ability)
    are fully employed. While the unemployment rate in labor markets
    will never be zero, full employment in the labor market refers to
    zero cyclical unemployment. There will still be some level of
    unemployment due to frictional or structural unemployment, but when
    the economy is operating with zero cyclical unemployment, economists
    say that the economy is at the natural rate of unemployment or at
    full employment.

    <a href="#bookmark537" id="bookmark1024" class="s34">Economists benchmark actual or real GDP against the potential GDP to determine how well the economy is performing. As explained in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark537" class="a">Economic</a> <span
    class="s54">Growth</span>, we can explain GDP growth by increases
    and investment in physical capital and human capital per person as
    well as advances in technology. **Physical capital per person**
    refers to the amount and kind of machinery and equipment available
    to help people get work done. Compare, for example, your
    productivity in typing a term paper on a typewriter to working on
    your laptop with word processing software. Clearly, you will be able
    to be more productive using word processing software. The technology
    and level of capital of your laptop and software has increased your
    productivity. More broadly, the development of GPS technology and
    Universal Product Codes (those barcodes on every product we buy) has
    made it much easier for firms to track shipments, tabulate
    inventories, and sell and distribute products. These two
    technological innovations, and many others, have increased a
    nation's ability to produce goods and services for a given
    population. Likewise, increasing human capital involves increasing
    levels of knowledge, education, and skill sets per person through
    vocational or higher education. Physical and human capital
    improvements with technological advances will increase overall
    productivity and, thus, GDP.<span id="bookmark1025">‌</span>

    <span id="bookmark1026">To see how these improvements have increased
    productivity and output at the national level, we should examine
    evidence from the United States. The United States experienced
    significant growth in the twentieth century due to phenomenal
    changes in infrastructure, equipment, and technological improvements
    in physical capital and human capital. The population more than
    tripled in the twentieth century, from 76 million in 1900 to over
    300 million in 2016. The human capital of modern workers is far
    higher today because the education and skills of workers have risen
    dramatically. In 1900, only about one-eighth of the U.S. population
    had completed high school and just one person in 40 had completed a
    four-year college degree. By 2010, more than 87% of Americans had a
    high school degree and over 29% had a four-year college degree as
    well. In 2014, 40% of working-age Americans had a four-year college
    degree. The average amount of physical capital per worker has grown
    dramatically. The technology available to modern workers is
    extraordinarily better than a century ago: cars, airplanes,
    electrical machinery, smartphones, computers, chemical and
    biological advances, materials science, health care—the list of
    technological advances could run on and on. More workers, higher
    skill levels, larger amounts of physical capital per worker, and
    amazingly better technology, and potential GDP for the U.S. economy
    has clearly increased a great deal since 1900.</span>

    This growth has fallen below its potential GDP and, at times, has
    exceeded its potential. For example from 2008 to

      

      

    <a href="#bookmark1027" class="s34">2009, the U.S. economy tumbled into recession and remains below its potential. At other times, like in the late 1990s, the economy ran at potential GDP—or even slightly ahead.</a>

    class="p">shows the actual data for the increase in real GDP
    since 1960. The slightly smoother line shows the potential GDP since
    1960 as estimated by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
    Most economic recessions and upswings are times when the economy is
    1–3% below or above potential GDP in a given year. Clearly,
    short-run fluctuations around potential GDP do exist, but over the
    long run, the upward trend of potential GDP determines the size of
    the economy.</span>

    in human capital, and technological advancements shift potential GDP
    and the vertical LRAS curve gradually to the right. Economists often
    describe this gradual increase in an economy's potential GDP as a
    nation's long-term economic growth.</span><span

    shifts to the right as productivity increases and potential GDP
    expands.</span>

    The Role of Flexible Prices

    How does the macroeconomy adjust back to its level of potential GDP
    in the long run? What if aggregate demand increases or decreases?
    Economists base the neoclassical view of how the macroeconomy
    adjusts on the insight that even if wages and prices are “sticky”,
    or slow to change, in the short run, they are flexible over time. To
    understand this better, let's follow the connections from the
    short-run to the long-run macroeconomic equilibrium.

    <a href="#bookmark1031" class="s34">The aggregate demand and aggregate supply diagram in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1031" class="a">Figure 13.4</a><span class="s54">
    </span>shows two aggregate supply curves. We draw the original
    upward sloping aggregate supply curve (SRAS<span
    class="s60">0</span>) is a short-run or Keynesian AS curve. The
    vertical aggregate supply curve (LRASn) is the long-run or
    neoclassical AS curve, which is located at potential GDP. The
    original aggregate demand curve, labeled AD<span
    class="s60">0</span>, so that the original equilibrium occurs at
    point E<span class="s60">0</span>, at which point the economy is
    producing at its potential GDP.

      

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_280.jpg" width="301" height="274" alt="image" />

    <span id="bookmark1031"><span class="s36">Figure 13.4 The Rebound to
    Potential GDP after AD Increases </span></span>The original
    equilibrium (E<span class="s63">0</span>), at an output level of 500
    and a price level of 120, happens at the intersection of the
    aggregate demand curve (AD<span class="s63">0</span>) and the
    short-run aggregate supply curve (SRAS<span class="s63">0</span>).
    The output at E<span class="s63">0</span> is equal to potential GDP.
    Aggregate demand shifts right from AD<span class="s63">0</span> to
    AD<span class="s63">1</span>. The new equilibrium is E<span
    class="s63">1</span>, with a higher output level of 550 and an
    increase in the price level to 125. With unemployment rates
    unsustainably low, eager employers bid up wages, which shifts
    short-run aggregate supply to the left, from SRAS<span
    class="s63">0</span> to SRAS<span class="s63">1</span>. The new
    equilibrium (E<span class="s63">2</span>) is at the same original
    level of output, 500, but at a higher price level of 130. Thus, the
    long-run aggregate supply curve (LRASn), which is vertical at the
    level of potential GDP, determines the level of real GDP in this
    economy in the long run.

      

    Now, imagine that some economic event boosts aggregate demand:
    perhaps a surge of export sales or a rise in business confidence
    that leads to more investment, perhaps a policy decision like higher
    government spending, or perhaps a tax cut that leads to additional
    aggregate demand. The short-run Keynesian analysis is that the rise
    in aggregate demand will shift the aggregate demand curve out to the
    right, from AD<span class="s60">0</span> to AD<span
    class="s60">1</span>, leading to a new equilibrium at point E<span
    class="s60">1</span> with higher output, lower unemployment, and
    pressure for an inflationary rise in the price level.

    In the long-run neoclassical analysis, however, the chain of
    economic events is just beginning. As economic output rises above
    potential GDP, the level of unemployment falls. The economy is now
    above full employment and there is a labor shortage. Eager employers
    are trying to bid workers away from other companies and to encourage
    their current workers to exert more effort and to work longer hours.
    This high demand for labor will drive up wages. Most employers
    review their workers salaries only once or twice a year, and so it
    will take time before the higher wages filter through the economy.
    As wages do rise, it will mean a leftward shift in the short-run
    Keynesian aggregate supply curve back to SRAS<span
    class="s60">1</span>, because the price of a major input to
    production has increased. The economy moves to a new equilibrium
    (E<span class="s60">2</span>). The new equilibrium has the same
    level of real GDP as did the original equilibrium (E<span
    class="s60">0</span>), but there has been an inflationary increase
    in the price level.

    This description of the short-run shift from E<span
    class="s60">0</span> to E<span class="s60">1</span> and the long-run
    shift from E<span class="s60">1</span> to E<span
    class="s60">2</span> is a step-by-step way of making a simple point:
    the economy cannot sustain production above its potential GDP in the
    long run. An economy may produce above its level of potential GDP in
    the short run, under pressure from a surge in aggregate demand. Over
    the long run, however, that surge in aggregate demand ends up as an
    increase in the price level, not as a rise in output.

    <a href="#bookmark1032" class="s34">The rebound of the economy back to potential GDP also works in response to a shift to the left in aggregate demand.</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1032" class="a">Figure 13.5</a><span class="s54">
    </span>again starts with two aggregate supply curves, with SRAS<span
    class="s60">0</span> showing the original upward sloping short-run
    Keynesian AS curve and LRASn showing the vertical long-run
    neoclassical aggregate supply curve. A decrease in aggregate
    demand—for example, because of a decline in consumer confidence that
    leads to less consumption and more saving—causes the original
    aggregate demand curve AD<span class="s60">0</span> to shift back to
    AD<span class="s60">1</span>. The shift from the original
    equilibrium (E<span class="s60">0</span>) to the new equilibrium
    (E<span class="s60">1</span>) results in a decline in output. The
    economy is now below full employment and there is a surplus of
    labor. As output falls below potential GDP, unemployment rises.
    While a lower price level (i.e., deflation) is rare in the United
    States, it does happen occasionally during very weak periods of
    economic activity. For practical purposes, we might consider a lower
    price level in the AD–AS model as indicative of disinflation, which
    is a decline in the inflation rate. Thus, the long-run aggregate
    supply curve LRASn, which is

      

      

    vertical at the level of potential GDP, ultimately determines this
    economy's real GDP.

      

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_281.jpg" width="312" height="262" alt="image" />

    <span id="bookmark1032"><span class="s36">Figure 13.5 A Rebound Back
    to Potential GDP from a Shift to the Left in Aggregate Demand
    </span></span>The original equilibrium (E<span
    class="s63">0</span>), at an output level of 500 and a price level
    of 120, happens at the intersection of the aggregate demand curve
    (AD<span class="s63">0</span>) and the short-run aggregate supply
    curve (SRAS<span class="s63">0</span>). The output at E<span
    class="s63">0</span> is equal to potential GDP. Aggregate demand
    shifts left, from AD<span class="s63">0</span> to AD<span
    class="s63">1</span>. The new equilibrium is at E<span
    class="s63">1</span>, with a lower output level of 450 and downward
    pressure on the price level of 115. With high unemployment rates,
    wages are held down. Lower wages are an economy-wide decrease in the
    price of a key input, which shifts short-run aggregate supply to the
    right, from SRAS<span class="s63">0</span> to SRAS<span
    class="s63">1</span>. The new equilibrium (E<span
    class="s63">2</span>) is at the same original level of output, 500,
    but at a lower price level of 110.

      

    Again, from the neoclassical perspective, this short-run scenario is
    only the beginning of the chain of events. The higher level of
    unemployment means more workers looking for jobs. As a result,
    employers can hold down on pay increases—or perhaps even replace
    some of their higher-paid workers with unemployed people willing to
    accept a lower wage. As wages stagnate or fall, this decline in the
    price of a key input means that the short-run Keynesian aggregate
    supply curve shifts to the right from its original (SRAS<span
    class="s60">0</span> to SRAS<span class="s60">1</span>). The overall
    impact in the long run, as the macroeconomic equilibrium shifts from
    E<span class="s60">0</span> to E<span class="s60">1</span> to E<span
    class="s60">2</span>, is that the level of output returns to
    potential GDP, where it started. There is, however, downward
    pressure on the price level. Thus, in the neoclassical view, changes
    in aggregate demand can have a short-run impact on output and on
    unemployment—but only a short-run impact. In the long run, when
    wages and prices are flexible, potential GDP and aggregate supply
    determine real GDP's size.

    How Fast Is the Speed of Macroeconomic Adjustment?

    <span id="bookmark1033">How long does it take for wages and prices
    to adjust, and for the economy to rebound to its potential GDP? This
    subject is highly contentious. Keynesian economists argue that if
    the adjustment from recession to potential GDP takes a very long
    time, then neoclassical theory may be more hypothetical than
    practical. In response to John Maynard Keynes' immortal words, “In
    the long run we are all dead,” neoclassical economists respond that
    even if the adjustment takes as long as, say, ten years the
    neoclassical perspective remains of central importance in
    understanding the economy.</span>

    <span id="bookmark1034">One subset of neoclassical economists holds
    that wage and price adjustment in the macroeconomy might be quite
    rapid. The theory of</span> **rational expectations** holds that
    people form the most accurate possible expectations about the future
    that they can, using all information available to them. In an
    economy where most people have rational expectations, economic
    adjustments may happen very quickly.

    To understand how rational expectations may affect the speed of
    price adjustments, think about a situation in the real estate
    market. Imagine that several events seem likely to push up home
    values in the neighborhood. Perhaps a local employer announces that
    it plans to hire many more people or the city announces that it will
    build a local park or a library in that neighborhood. The theory of
    rational expectations points out that even though none of the
    changes will happen immediately, home prices in the neighborhood
    will rise immediately, because the expectation that homes will be
    worth more in the future will lead buyers to be willing to pay more
    in the present. The amount of the immediate increase in home prices
    will depend on how likely it seems that the announcements about the
    future will actually

      

      

    happen and on how distant the local jobs and neighborhood
    improvements are in the future. The key point is that, because of
    rational expectations, prices do not wait on events, but adjust
    immediately.

    At a macroeconomic level, the theory of rational expectations points
    out that if the aggregate supply curve is vertical over time, then
    people should rationally expect this pattern. When a shift in
    aggregate demand occurs, people and businesses with rational
    expectations will know that its impact on output and employment will
    be temporary, while its impact on the price level will be permanent.
    If firms and workers perceive the outcome of the process in advance,
    and if all firms and workers know that everyone else is perceiving
    the process in the same way, then they have no incentive to go
    through an extended series of short-run scenarios, like a firm first
    hiring more people when aggregate demand shifts out and then firing
    those same people when aggregate supply shifts back. Instead,
    everyone will recognize where this process is heading—toward a
    change in the price level—and then will act on that expectation. In
    this scenario, the expected long-run change in the price level may
    happen very quickly, without a drawn-out zigzag of output and
    employment first moving one way and then the other.

    <span id="bookmark1035">The theory that people and firms have
    rational expectations can be a useful simplification, but as a
    statement about how people and businesses actually behave, the
    assumption seems too strong. After all, many people and firms are
    not especially well informed, either about what is happening in the
    economy or about how the economy works. An alternate assumption is
    that people and firms act with</span> **adaptive expectations**:
    they look at past experience and gradually adapt their beliefs and
    behavior as circumstances change, but are not perfect synthesizers
    of information and accurate predictors of the future in the sense of
    rational expectations theory. If most people and businesses have
    some form of adaptive expectations, then the adjustment from the
    short run and long run will be traced out in incremental steps that
    occur over time.

    The empirical evidence on the speed of macroeconomic adjustment of
    prices and wages is not clear-cut. The speed of macroeconomic
    adjustment probably varies among different countries and time
    periods. A reasonable guess is that the initial short-run effect of
    a shift in aggregate demand might last two to five years, before the
    adjustments in wages and prices cause the economy to adjust back to
    potential GDP. Thus, one might think of the short run for applying
    Keynesian analysis as time periods less than two to five years, and
    the long run for applying neoclassical analysis as longer than five
    years. For practical purposes, this guideline is frustratingly
    imprecise, but when analyzing a complex social mechanism like an
    economy as it evolves over time, some imprecision seems unavoidable.

2.  <span id="bookmark1014">|</span> <span style=" color: #3767B1;">The
    Policy Implications of the Neoclassical Perspective</span><span
    id="bookmark1036">‌</span>

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Discuss why and how economists measure inflation expectations

    -   Analyze the impacts of fiscal and monetary policy on aggregate
        supply and aggregate demand

    -   Explain the neoclassical Phillips curve, noting its tradeoff
        between inflation and unemployment

    -   Identify clear distinctions between neoclassical economics and
        Keynesian economics

      

    To understand the policy recommendations of the neoclassical
    economists, it helps to start with the Keynesian perspective.
    Suppose a decrease in aggregate demand causes the economy to go into
    recession with high unemployment. The Keynesian response would be to
    use government policy to stimulate aggregate demand and eliminate
    the recessionary gap. The neoclassical economists believe that the
    Keynesian response, while perhaps well intentioned, will not have a
    good outcome for reasons we will discuss shortly. Since the
    neoclassical economists believe that the economy will correct itself
    over time, the only advantage of a Keynesian stabilization policy
    would be to accelerate the process and minimize the time that the
    unemployed are out of work. Is that the likely outcome?

    <span id="bookmark1037">Keynesian macroeconomic policy requires some
    optimism about the government's ability to recognize a situation of
    too little or too much aggregate demand, and to adjust aggregate
    demand accordingly with the right level of changes in taxes or
    spending, all enacted in a timely fashion. After all, neoclassical
    economists argue, it takes government statisticians months to
    produce even preliminary estimates of GDP so that politicians know
    whether a recession is occurring—and those preliminary estimates may
    be revised substantially later. Moreover, there is the question of
    timely action. The political process can take more months to enact a
    tax cut or a spending increase. Political or economic considerations
    may determine the amount of tax or spending changes. Then the
    economy will take still</span>

      

      

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_282.png" width="624" height="481" alt="image" />

    more months to put into effect changes in aggregate demand through
    spending and production. When economists and policy makers consider
    all of these time lags and political realities, active fiscal policy
    may fail to address the current problem, and could even make the
    future economy worse. The average U.S. post-World War II recession
    has lasted only about a year. By the time government policy
    activates, the recession will likely be over. As a consequence, the
    only result of government fine-tuning will be to stimulate the
    economy when it is already recovering (or to contract the economy
    when it is already falling). In other words, an active macroeconomic
    policy is likely to exacerbate the cycles rather than dampen them.
    Some neoclassical economists believe a large part of the business
    cycles we observe are due to flawed government policy. To learn
    about this issue further, read the following Clear It Up feature.

      

    Why and how do economists measure inflation expectations?

    <span id="bookmark1038">People take expectations about inflation
    into consideration every time they make a major purchase, such as a
    house or a car. As inflation fluctuates, so too does the nominal
    interest rate on loans to buy these goods. The nominal interest rate
    is comprised of the real rate, plus an</span> **expected inflation**
    factor. Expected inflation also tells economists about how the
    public views the economy's direction. Suppose the public expects
    inflation to increase. This could be the result of positive demand
    shock due to an expanding economy and increasing aggregate demand.
    It could also be the result of a negative supply shock, perhaps from
    rising energy prices, and decreasing aggregate supply. In either
    case, the public may expect the central bank to engage in
    contractionary monetary policy to reduce inflation, and this policy
    results in higher interest rates. If, however economists expect
    inflation to decrease, the public may anticipate a recession. In
    turn, the public may expect expansionary monetary policy, and lower
    interest rates, in the short run. By monitoring expected inflation,
    economists garner information about the effectiveness of
    macroeconomic policies. Additionally, monitoring expected inflation
    allows for projecting the direction of real interest rates that
    isolate for the effect of inflation. This information is necessary
    for making decisions about financing investments.

    Expectations about inflation may seem like a highly theoretical
    concept, but, in fact the Federal Reserve Bank measures, inflation
    expectations based upon early research conducted by Joseph
    Livingston, a financial journalist for the *Philadelphia Inquirer*.
    In 1946, he started a twice-a-year survey of economists about their
    expectations of inflation. After Livingston's death in 1969, the
    Federal Reserve Bank and other economic research agencies such as
    the Survey Research Center at the University of Michigan, the
    American Statistical Association, and the National Bureau of
    Economic Research continued the survey.

    actual inflation that has occurred, and the results, so far, are

    accurate in the last few decades. Economists are actively
    researching how inflation expectations and other economic variables
    form and change.

    The Neoclassical Phillips Curve Tradeoff

    <a href="#bookmark952" id="bookmark1039" class="a">The Keynesian Perspective</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1040" class="s34">introduced the Phillips curve and explained how it is derived from the aggregate supply curve. The short run upward sloping aggregate supply curve implies a downward sloping Phillips curve; thus, there is a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment in the short run. By contrast, a neoclassical long-run aggregate supply curve will imply a vertical shape for the Phillips curve, indicating no long run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment.</a>

    With a vertical LRAS curve, shifts in aggregate demand do not alter
    the level of output but do lead to changes in the price level.
    Because output is unchanged between the equilibria E<span
    class="s63">0</span>, E<span class="s63">1</span>, and E<span
    class="s63">2</span>, all unemployment in this economy will be due
    to the natural rate of unemployment. (b) If the natural rate of
    unemployment is 5%, then the Phillips curve will be vertical. That
    is, regardless of changes in the price level, the unemployment rate
    remains at 5%.

    Step 2. What patterns do you see in the data? You should notice that
    there are years when unemployment falls but inflation rises, and
    other years where unemployment rises and inflation falls.

    Step 3. Can you determine the natural rate of unemployment from the
    data or from the graph? As you analyze the graph, it appears that
    the natural rate of unemployment lies at 4%. This is the rate that
    the economy appears to adjust back to after an apparent change in
    the economy. For example, in 1975 the economy appeared to have an
    increase in aggregate demand. The unemployment rate fell to 3% but
    inflation increased from 2% to 3%. By 1980, the economy had adjusted
    back to 4% unemployment and the inflation rate had returned to 2%.
    In 1985, the economy looks to have suffered a recession as
    unemployment rose to 6% and inflation fell to 1%. This would be
    consistent with a decrease in aggregate demand. By 1990, the economy
    recovered back to 4% unemployment, but at a lower inflation rate of
    1%. In 1995 the economy again rebounded and unemployment fell to 2%,
    but inflation increased to 4%, which is consistent with a large
    increase in aggregate demand. The economy adjusted back to 4%
    unemployment but at a higher rate of inflation of 5%. Then in 2000,
    both unemployment and inflation increased to 5% and 4%,
    respectively.

    Step 4. Do you see the Phillips curve(s) in the data? If we trace
    the downward sloping trend of data points, we could see a short-run
    Phillips curve that exhibits the inverse tradeoff between higher
    unemployment and lower inflation rates. If we trace the vertical
    line of data points, we could see a long-run Phillips curve at the
    4% natural rate of unemployment.

      

    <span id="bookmark1043">The unemployment rate on the long-run
    Phillips curve will be the natural rate of unemployment. A small
    inflationary increase in the price level from AD</span><span
    class="s60">0</span> to AD<span class="s60">1</span> will have the
    same natural rate of unemployment as a larger inflationary increase
    in the price level from AD<span class="s60">0</span> to AD<span
    class="s60">2</span>. The macroeconomic equilibrium along the
    vertical aggregate supply curve can occur at a variety of different
    price levels, and the natural rate of unemployment can be consistent
    with all different rates of inflation. The great economist Milton
    Friedman (1912–2006) summed up the neoclassical view of the
    long-term Phillips curve tradeoff in a 1967 speech: “\[T\]here is
    always a temporary trade-off between inflation and unemployment;
    there is no permanent trade-off.”

    In the Keynesian perspective, the primary focus is on getting the
    level of aggregate demand right in relationship to an upward-sloping
    aggregate supply curve. That is, the government should adjust AD so
    that the economy produces at its potential GDP, not so low that
    cyclical unemployment results and not so high that inflation
    results. In the neoclassical perspective, aggregate supply will
    determine output at potential GDP, the natural rate of unemployment
    determines unemployment, and shifts in aggregate demand are the
    primary determinant of changes in the price level.

      

      

    Fighting Unemployment or Inflation?

    <a href="#bookmark619" id="bookmark1044" class="s34">As we explained in</a>
    Unemployment<span class="p">, economists divide unemployment into
    two categories: cyclical unemployment and the natural rate of
    unemployment, which is the sum of frictional and structural
    unemployment. Cyclical unemployment results from fluctuations in the
    business cycle and is created when the economy is producing below
    potential GDP—giving potential employers less incentive to hire.
    When the economy is producing at potential GDP, cyclical
    unemployment will be zero. Because of labor market dynamics, in
    which people are always entering or exiting the labor force, the
    unemployment rate never falls to 0%, not even when the economy is
    producing at or even slightly above potential GDP. Probably the best
    we can hope for is for the number of job vacancies to equal the
    number of job seekers. We know that it takes time for job seekers
    and employers to find each other, and this time is the cause of
    frictional unemployment. Most economists do not consider frictional
    unemployment to be a “bad” thing. After all, there will always be
    workers who are unemployed while looking for a job that is a better
    match for their skills. There will always be employers that have an
    open position, while looking for a worker that is a better match for
    the job. Ideally, these matches happen quickly, but even when the
    economy is very strong there will be some natural unemployment and
    this is what the natural rate of unemployment measures.</span><span
    id="bookmark1045">‌</span>

    The neoclassical view of unemployment tends to focus attention away
    from the cyclical unemployment problem—that is, unemployment caused
    by recession—while putting more attention on the unemployment rate
    issue that prevails even when the economy is operating at potential
    GDP. To put it another way, the neoclassical view of unemployment
    tends to focus on how the government can adjust public policy to
    reduce the natural rate of unemployment. Such policy changes might
    involve redesigning unemployment and welfare programs so that they

      

      

    support those in need, but also offer greater encouragement for
    job-hunting. It might involve redesigning business rules with an eye
    to whether they are unintentionally discouraging businesses from
    taking on new employees. It might involve building institutions to
    improve the flow of information about jobs and the mobility of
    workers, to help bring workers and employers together more quickly.
    For those workers who find that their skills are permanently no
    longer in demand (for example, the structurally unemployed),
    economists can design policy to provide opportunities for retraining
    so that these workers can reenter the labor force and seek
    employment.

    <span id="bookmark1046">Neoclassical economists will not tend to see
    aggregate demand as a useful tool for reducing unemployment; after
    all, with a vertical aggregate supply curve determining economic
    output, then aggregate demand has no long-run effect on
    unemployment. Instead, neoclassical economists believe that
    aggregate demand should be allowed to expand only to match the
    gradual shifts of aggregate supply to the right—keeping the price
    level much the same and inflationary pressures low.</span>

    <a href="#bookmark1048" id="bookmark1047" class="s34">If aggregate demand rises rapidly in the neoclassical model, in the long run it leads only to inflationary pressures.</a>

    Fighting Recession or Encouraging Long-Term Growth?

    Neoclassical economists believe that the economy will rebound out of
    a recession or eventually contract during an expansion because
    prices and wage rates are flexible and will adjust either upward or
    downward to restore the economy to its potential GDP. Thus, the key
    policy question for neoclassicals is how to promote growth of
    potential GDP. We know that economic growth ultimately depends on
    the growth rate of long-term productivity. Productivity measures how
    effective inputs are at producing outputs. We know that U.S.
    productivity has grown on average about 2% per year. That means that
    the same amount of inputs produce 2% more output than the year
    before. We also know that productivity growth varies a great deal in
    the short term due to cyclical factors. It also varies somewhat in
    the long term. From 1953–1972, U.S. labor productivity (as measured
    by output per hour in the business sector) grew at 3.2% per year.
    From 1973–1992, productivity growth declined significantly to 1.8%
    per year. Then, from 1993–2014, productivity growth increased
    slightly to 2% per year. The neoclassical economists believe the
    underpinnings of long- run productivity growth to be an economy’s
    investments in human capital, physical capital, and technology,
    operating together in a market-oriented environment that rewards
    innovation. Government policy should focus on promoting these
    factors.

    Summary of Neoclassical Macroeconomic Policy Recommendations

    Let’s summarize what neoclassical economists recommend for
    macroeconomic policy. Neoclassical economists do not believe in
    “fine-tuning” the economy. They believe that a stable economic
    environment with a low rate of inflation fosters economic growth.
    Similarly, tax rates should be low and unchanging. In this
    environment, private economic agents can make the best possible
    investment decisions, which will lead to optimal investment in
    physical and human capital as well as research and development to
    promote improvements in technology.

    style=" color: #3767B1;">Balancing Keynesian and Neoclassical
    Models</span><span id="bookmark1050">‌</span>

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Evaluate how neoclassical economists and Keynesian economists
        react to recessions

    -   Analyze the interrelationship between the neoclassical and
        Keynesian economic models

      

    We can compare finding the balance between Keynesian and
    Neoclassical models to the challenge of riding two horses
    simultaneously. When a circus performer stands on two horses, with a
    foot on each one, much of the excitement for the viewer lies in
    contemplating the gap between the two. As modern macroeconomists
    ride into the future on two horses—with one foot on the short-term
    Keynesian perspective and one foot on the long-term neoclassical
    perspective—the balancing act may look uncomfortable, but there does
    not seem to be any way to avoid it. Each approach, Keynesian and
    neoclassical, has its strengths and weaknesses.

    <span id="bookmark1051">The short-term Keynesian model, built on the
    importance of aggregate demand as a cause of business cycles and a
    degree of wage and price rigidity, does a sound job of explaining
    many recessions and why cyclical unemployment rises and falls. By
    focusing on the short-run aggregate demand adjustments, Keynesian
    economics risks overlooking the long-term causes of economic growth
    or the natural rate of unemployment that exist even when the economy
    is producing at potential GDP.</span>

    <span id="bookmark1052">The neoclassical model, with its emphasis on
    aggregate supply, focuses on the underlying determinants of output
    and employment in markets, and thus tends to put more emphasis on
    economic growth and how labor markets work. However, the
    neoclassical view is not especially helpful in explaining why
    unemployment moves up and down over short time horizons of a few
    years. Nor is the neoclassical model especially helpful when the
    economy is mired in an especially deep and long-lasting recession,
    like the 1930s Great Depression. Keynesian economics tends to view
    inflation as a price that might sometimes be paid for lower
    unemployment; neoclassical economics tends to view inflation as a
    cost that offers no offsetting gains in terms of lower
    unemployment.</span>

    <span id="bookmark1053">Macroeconomics cannot, however, be summed up
    as an argument between one group of economists who are pure
    Keynesians and another group who are pure neoclassicists. Instead,
    many mainstream economists believe both the Keynesian and
    neoclassical perspectives. Robert Solow, the Nobel laureate in
    economics in 1987, described the dual approach in this way:</span>

    At short time scales, I think, something sort of ‘Keynesian’ is a
    good approximation, and surely better than anything straight
    ‘neoclassical.’ At very long time scales, the interesting questions
    are best studied in a neoclassical framework, and attention to the
    Keynesian side of things would be a minor distraction. At the
    five-to-ten-year time scale, we have to piece things together as
    best we can, and look for a hybrid model that will do the job.

    Many modern macroeconomists spend considerable time and energy
    trying to construct models that blend the most attractive aspects of
    the Keynesian and neoclassical approaches. It is possible to
    construct a somewhat complex

    Navigating Unchartered Waters

    Were the policies that the government implemented to stabilize the
    economy and financial markets during the Great Recession effective?
    Many economists from both the Keynesian and neoclassical schools
    have found that they were, although to varying degrees. Alan Blinder
    of Princeton University and Mark Zandi for Moody’s Analytics found
    that, without fiscal policy, GDP decline would have been
    significantly more than its 3.3% in 2008 followed by its 0.1%
    decline in 2009. They also estimated that there would have been

    8.5 million more job losses had the government not intervened in the
    market with the TARP to support the financial industry and key
    automakers General Motors and Chrysler. Federal Reserve Bank
    economists Carlos Carvalho, Stefano Eusip, and Christian Grisse
    found in their study, *Policy Initiatives in the Global Recession:
    What Did Forecasters Expect?* that once the government implemented
    policies, forecasters adapted their expectations to these policies.
    They were more likely to anticipate increases in investment due to
    lower interest rates brought on by monetary policy and increased
    economic growth resulting from fiscal policy.

    The difficulty with evaluating the effectiveness of the
    stabilization policies that the government took in response to the
    Great Recession is that we will never know what would have happened
    had the government not implemented those policies. Surely some of
    the programs were more effective at creating and saving jobs, while
    other programs were less so. The final conclusion on the
    effectiveness of macroeconomic policies is still up for debate, and
    further study will no doubt consider the impact of these policies on
    the U.S. budget and deficit, as well as the U.S. dollar's value in
    the financial market.

    mathematical model where aggregate demand and sticky wages and
    prices matter in the short run, but wages, prices, and aggregate
    supply adjust in the long run. However, creating an overall model
    that encompasses both short-term Keynesian and long-term
    neoclassical models is not easy.

    KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY

      

    1.  <a href="#bookmark1020" class="a">The Building Blocks of Neoclassical</a>
        [Analysis](#bookmark1020)

        The neoclassical perspective argues that, in the long run, the
        economy will adjust back to its potential GDP level of output
        through flexible price levels. Thus, the neoclassical
        perspective views the long-run AS curve as vertical. A rational
        expectations perspective argues that people have excellent
        information about economic events and how the economy works and
        that, as a result, price and other economic adjustments will
        happen very quickly. In adaptive expectations theory, people
        have limited information about economic information and how the
        economy works, and so price and other economic adjustments can
        be slow.

          

    2.  <a href="#bookmark1036" class="a">The Policy Implications of the Neoclassical</a>
        [Perspective](#bookmark1036)

        Neoclassical economists tend to put relatively more emphasis on
        long-term growth than on fighting recession, because they
        believe that recessions will fade in a few years and long-term
        growth will ultimately determine the standard of living. They
        tend to focus more on reducing the natural rate of unemployment
        caused by economic institutions and government policies than the
        cyclical unemployment caused by recession.

        Neoclassical economists also see no social benefit to inflation.
        With an upward-sloping Keynesian AS curve, inflation can arise
        because an economy is approaching full employment. With a
        vertical long-run neoclassical AS curve, inflation does not
        accompany any rise in output. If aggregate supply is vertical,
        then aggregate demand does not affect the quantity of output.
        Instead, aggregate demand can only cause inflationary changes in
        the price level. A vertical aggregate supply curve, where the
        quantity of output is consistent with many different price
        levels, also implies a vertical Phillips curve.

          

    3.  <a href="#bookmark1050" class="a">Balancing Keynesian and Neoclassical</a>
        [Models](#bookmark1050)

The Keynesian perspective considers changes to aggregate demand to be
the cause of business cycle fluctuations. Keynesians are likely to
advocate that policy makers actively attempt to reverse recessionary and
inflationary periods because they are not convinced that the
self-correcting economy can easily return to full employment.

The neoclassical perspective places more emphasis on aggregate supply.
Neoclassical economists believe that long term productivity growth
determines the potential GDP level and that the economy typically will
return to full employment after a change in aggregate demand. Skeptical
of the effectiveness and timeliness of Keynesian policy, neoclassical
economists are more likely to advocate a hands-off, or fairly limited,
role for active stabilization policy.

While Keynesians would tend to advocate an acceptable tradeoff between
inflation and unemployment when counteracting a recession, neoclassical
economists argue that no such tradeoff exists. Any short-term gains in
lower unemployment will eventually vanish and the result of active
policy will only be inflation.

    REVIEW QUESTIONS

      

5.  Does neoclassical economics focus on the long term or the short
    term? Explain your answer.

6.  Does neoclassical economics view prices and wages as sticky or
    flexible? Why?

7.  What shape is the long-run aggregate supply curve? Why does it have
    this shape?

8.  What is the difference between rational expectations and adaptive
    expectations?

9.  A neoclassical economist and a Keynesian economist are studying the
    economy of Vineland. It appears that Vineland is beginning to
    experience a mild recession with a decrease in aggregate demand.
    Which of these two economists would likely advocate that the
    government of Vineland take active measures to reverse this decline
    in aggregate demand? Why?

10. Do neoclassical economists tend to focus more on long term economic
    growth or on recessions? Explain briefly.

11. Do neoclassical economists tend to focus more on cyclical
    unemployment or on inflation? Explain briefly.

      

    CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS

      

    1.  If most people have rational expectations, how long will
        recessions last?

    2.  Explain why the neoclassical economists believe that the
        government does not need to do much about unemployment. Do you
        agree or disagree? Explain.

12. Do neoclassical economists see a value in tolerating a little more
    inflation if it brings additional economic output? Explain your
    answer.

13. If aggregate supply is vertical, what role does aggregate demand
    play in determining output? In determining the price level?

14. What is the shape of the neoclassical long-run Phillips curve? What
    assumptions do economists make that lead to this shape?

15. When the economy is experiencing a recession, why would a
    neoclassical economist be unlikely to argue for aggressive policy to
    stimulate aggregate demand and return the economy to full
    employment? Explain your answer.

16. If the economy is suffering through a rampant inflationary period,
    would a Keynesian economist advocate for stabilization policy that
    involves higher taxes and higher interest rates? Explain your
    answer.

  

1.  Economists from all theoretical persuasions criticized the American
    Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The “Stimulus Package” was arguably a
    Keynesian measure so why would a Keynesian economist be critical of
    it? Why would neoclassical economists be critical?

2.  Is it a logical contradiction to be a neoclassical Keynesian?
    Explain.

The Many Disguises of Money: From Cowries to Bitcoins

Here is a trivia question: In the history of the world, what item did
people use for money over the broadest geographic area and for the
longest period of time? The answer is not gold, silver, or any precious
metal. It is the cowrie, a mollusk shell found mainly off the Maldives
Islands in the Indian Ocean. Cowries served as money as early as 700
B.C. in China. By the 1500s, they were in widespread use across India
and Africa. For several centuries after that, cowries were the means for
exchange in markets including southern Europe, western Africa, India,
and China: everything from buying lunch or a ferry ride to paying for a
shipload of silk or rice. Cowries were still acceptable as a way of
paying taxes in certain African nations in the early twentieth century.

What made cowries work so well as money? First, they are extremely
durable—lasting a century or more. As the late economic historian Karl
Polyani put it, they can be “poured, sacked, shoveled, hoarded in heaps”
while remaining “clean, dainty, stainless, polished, and milk-white.”
Second, parties could use cowries either by counting shells of a certain
size, or—for large purchases—by measuring the weight or volume of the
total shells they would exchange. Third, it was impossible to
counterfeit a cowrie shell, but dishonest people could counterfeit gold
or silver coins by making copies with cheaper metals. Finally, in the
heyday of cowrie money, from the 1500s into the 1800s, governments,
first the Portuguese, then the Dutch and English, tightly controlled
collecting cowries. As a result, the supply of cowries grew quickly
enough to serve the needs of

throughout the ages has taken many different forms and continues to
evolve even today. What do you think money is?

<a href="#bookmark14" class="a">Welcome to</a> Economics!<span
class="p">: economic growth, low unemployment, and low inflation. We
have yet to discuss money and its role in helping to achieve our
macroeconomic goals.</span><span id="bookmark1073">‌</span>

<a href="#bookmark1177" id="bookmark1074" class="s34">You should also understand Keynesian and neoclassical frameworks for macroeconomic analysis and how we can embody these frameworks in the aggregate demand/aggregate supply (AD/AS) model. With the goals and frameworks for macroeconomic analysis in mind, the final step is to discuss the two main categories of macroeconomic policy: monetary policy, which focuses on money, banking and interest rates; and fiscal policy, which focuses on government spending, taxes, and borrowing. This chapter discusses what economists mean by money, and how money is closely interrelated with the banking system.</a>

    style=" color: #3767B1;">Defining Money by Its Functions</span><span
    id="bookmark1075">‌</span>

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Explain the various functions of money

    -   Contrast commodity money and fiat money

      

    Money for the sake of money is not an end in itself. You cannot eat
    dollar bills or wear your bank account. Ultimately, the usefulness
    of money rests in exchanging it for goods or services. As the
    American writer and humorist Ambrose Bierce (1842–1914) wrote in
    1911, money is a “blessing that is of no advantage to us excepting
    when we part with it.” Money is what people regularly use when
    purchasing or selling goods and services, and thus both buyers and
    sellers must widely accept money. This concept of money is
    intentionally flexible, because money has taken a wide variety of
    forms in different cultures.

    Barter and the Double Coincidence of Wants

    <span id="bookmark1076">To understand the usefulness of money, we
    must consider what the world would be like without money. How would
    people exchange goods and services? Economies without money
    typically engage in the barter system.</span> **Barter**—literally
    trading one good or service for another—is highly inefficient for
    trying to coordinate the trades in a modern advanced economy. In an
    economy without money, an exchange between two people would involve
    a **double coincidence of wants**, a situation in which two people
    each want some good or service that the other person can provide.
    For example, if an accountant wants a pair of shoes, this accountant
    must find someone who has a pair of shoes in the correct size and
    who is willing to exchange the shoes for some hours of accounting
    services. Such a trade is likely to be difficult to arrange. Think
    about the complexity of such trades in a modern economy, with its
    extensive division of labor that involves thousands upon thousands
    of different jobs and goods.<span id="bookmark1077">‌</span>

    Another problem with the barter system is that it does not allow us
    to easily enter into future contracts for purchasing many goods and
    services. For example, if the goods are perishable it may be
    difficult to exchange them for other goods in the future. Imagine a
    farmer wanting to buy a tractor in six months using a fresh crop of
    strawberries. Additionally, while the barter system might work
    adequately in small economies, it will keep these economies from

      

      

    growing. The time that individuals would otherwise spend producing
    goods and services and enjoying leisure time they spend bartering.

    Functions for Money

    <span id="bookmark1078">Money solves the problems that the barter
    system creates. (We will get to its definition soon.) First, money
    serves as a</span> **medium of exchange**, which means that money
    acts as an intermediary between the buyer and the seller. Instead of
    exchanging accounting services for shoes, the accountant now
    exchanges accounting services for money. The accountant then uses
    this money to buy shoes. To serve as a medium of exchange, people
    must widely accept money as a method of payment in the markets for
    goods, labor, and financial capital.

    <span id="bookmark1079">Second, money must serve as a</span> **store
    of value**. In a barter system, we saw the example of the shoemaker
    trading shoes for accounting services. However, she risks having her
    shoes go out of style, especially if she keeps them in a warehouse
    for future use—their value will decrease with each season. Shoes are
    not a good store of value. Holding money is a much easier way of
    storing value. You know that you do not need to spend it immediately
    because it will still hold its value the next day, or the next year.
    This function of money does not require that money is a *perfect*
    store of value. In an economy with inflation, money loses some
    buying power each year, but it remains money.

    <span id="bookmark1080">Third, money serves as a</span> **unit of
    account**, which means that it is the ruler by which we measure
    values. For example, an accountant may charge $100 to file your tax
    return. That $100 can purchase two pair of shoes at $50 a pair.
    Money acts as a common denominator, an accounting method that
    simplifies thinking about trade-offs.

    <span id="bookmark1081">Finally, another function of money is that
    it must serve as a</span> **standard of deferred payment**. This
    means that if money is usable today to make purchases, it must also
    be acceptable to make purchases today that the purchaser will pay in
    the *future*. Loans and future agreements are stated in monetary
    terms and the standard of deferred payment is what allows us to buy
    goods and services today and pay in the future. Thus, **money**
    serves all of these functions— it is a medium of exchange, store of
    value, unit of account, and standard of deferred payment.<span
    id="bookmark1082">‌</span>

    Commodity versus Fiat Money

    <span id="bookmark1083">Money has taken a wide variety of forms in
    different cultures. People have used gold, silver, cowrie shells,
    cigarettes, and even cocoa beans as money. Although we use these
    items as</span> **commodity money**, they also have a value from use
    as something other than money. For example, people have used gold
    throughout the ages as money although today we do not use it as
    money but rather value it for its other attributes. Gold is a good
    conductor of electricity and the electronics and aerospace industry
    use it. Other industries use gold too, such as to manufacture energy
    efficient reflective glass for skyscrapers and is used in the
    medical industry as well. Of course, gold also has value because of
    its beauty and malleability in creating jewelry.

    <span id="bookmark1084">As commodity money, gold has historically
    served its purpose as a medium of exchange, a store of value, and as
    a unit of account.</span> **Commodity-backed currencies**
    <a href="#bookmark1085" class="s34">are dollar bills or other currencies with values backed up by gold or other commodities held at a bank. During much of its history, gold and silver backed the money supply in the United States. Interestingly, antique dollars dated as late as 1957, have “Silver Certificate” printed over the portrait of George Washington, as</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1085" class="a">Figure 14.2</a><span class="s54">
    </span>shows. This meant that the holder could take the bill to the
    appropriate bank and exchange it for a dollar’s worth of silver.

    decree). (Credit: “The.Comedian”/Flickr Creative Commons)</span>

    <span style=" color: #000;">on the “History of Money.”</span>

    <span id="bookmark1086">As economies grew and became more global in
    nature, the use of commodity monies became more cumbersome.
    Countries moved towards the use of</span> **fiat money**. Fiat money
    has no intrinsic value, but is declared by a government to be a
    country's legal tender. The United States’ paper money, for example,
    carries the statement: “THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER FOR ALL DEBTS,
    PUBLIC AND PRIVATE.” In other words, by government decree, if you
    owe a debt, then legally speaking, you can pay that debt with the
    U.S. currency, even though it is not backed by a commodity. The only
    backing of our money is universal faith and trust that the currency
    has value, and nothing more.

      

      

2.  <span id="bookmark1066">|</span> <span
    style=" color: #3767B1;">Measuring Money: Currency, M1, and
    M2</span><span id="bookmark1087">‌</span>

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Contrast M1 money supply and M2 money supply

    -   Classify monies as M1 money supply or M2 money supply

      

    <span id="bookmark1088">Cash in your pocket certainly serves as
    money; however, what about checks or credit cards? Are they money,
    too? Rather than trying to state a single way of measuring money,
    economists offer broader definitions of money based on liquidity.
    Liquidity refers to how quickly you can use a financial asset to buy
    a good or service. For example, cash is very liquid. You can use
    your $10 bill easily to buy a hamburger at lunchtime. However, $10
    that you have in your</span>

      

      

    savings account is not so easy to use. You must go to the bank or
    ATM machine and withdraw that cash to buy your lunch. Thus, $10 in
    your savings account is *less* liquid.

    <span id="bookmark1089">The Federal Reserve Bank, which is the
    central bank of the United States, is a bank regulator and is
    responsible for monetary policy and defines money according to its
    liquidity. There are two definitions of money: M1 and M2 money
    supply.</span> **M1 money supply** includes those monies that are
    very liquid such as cash, checkable (demand) deposits, and
    traveler’s checks **M2 money supply** is less liquid in nature and
    includes M1 plus savings and time deposits, certificates of
    deposits, and money market funds.<span
    id="bookmark1090">‌</span><span id="bookmark1091">‌</span>

    <span id="bookmark1092">M1 money supply includes</span> **coins and
    currency in circulation**—the coins and bills that circulate in an
    economy that the U.S. Treasury does not hold at the Federal Reserve
    Bank, or in bank vaults. Closely related to currency are checkable
    deposits, also known as **demand deposits**. These are the amounts
    held in checking accounts. They are called demand deposits or
    checkable deposits because the banking institution must give the
    deposit holder his money “on demand” when the customer writes a
    check or uses a debit card. These items together—currency, and
    checking accounts in banks—comprise the definition of money known as
    M1, which the Federal Reserve System measures daily.<span
    id="bookmark1093">‌</span>

    <span id="bookmark1094">A broader definition of money, M2 includes
    everything in M1 but also adds other types of deposits. For example,
    M2 includes</span> **savings deposits** in banks, which are bank
    accounts on which you cannot write a check directly, but from which
    you can easily withdraw the money at an automatic teller machine or
    bank. Many banks and other financial institutions also offer a
    chance to invest in **money market funds**, where they pool together
    the deposits of many individual investors and invest them in a safe
    way, such as short-term government bonds. Another ingredient of M2
    are the relatively small (that is, less than about $100,000)
    certificates of deposit (CDs) or **time
    deposits**<a href="#bookmark1097" class="s34">, which are accounts that the depositor has committed to leaving in the bank for a certain period of time, ranging from a few months to a few years, in exchange for a higher interest rate. In short, all these types of M2 are money that you can withdraw and spend, but which require a greater effort to do so than the items in M1.</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1097" class="a">Figure 14.3</a><span class="s54">
    </span>should help in visualizing the relationship between M1 and
    M2. Note that M1 is included in the M2 calculation.<span
    id="bookmark1095">‌</span><span id="bookmark1096">‌</span>

    <span id="bookmark1097">Figure 14.3 The Relationship between M1 and
    M2 Money</span> <span class="s37">M1 and M2 money have several
    definitions, ranging from narrow to broad. M1 = coins and currency
    in circulation + checkable (demand) deposit + traveler’s checks. M2
    = M1 + savings deposits + money market funds + certificates of
    deposit + other time deposits.</span>

      

    <a href="#bookmark1098" class="s34">The Federal Reserve System is responsible for tracking the amounts of M1 and M2 and prepares a weekly release of information about the money supply. To provide an idea of what these amounts sound like, according to the Federal Reserve Bank’s measure of the U.S. money stock, at the end of February 2015, M1 in the United States was $3 trillion, while M2 was $11.8 trillion.</a>

    The lines separating M1 and M2 can become a little blurry. Sometimes
    businesses do not treat elements of M1 alike. For example, some
    businesses will not accept personal checks for large amounts, but
    will accept traveler’s checks or cash. Changes in banking practices
    and technology have made the savings accounts in M2 more similar to
    the checking accounts in M1. For example, some savings accounts will
    allow depositors to write checks, use automatic teller machines, and
    pay bills over the internet, which has made it easier to access
    savings accounts. As with many other economic terms and statistics,
    the important point is to know the strengths and limitations of the
    various definitions of money, not to believe that such definitions
    are as clear-cut to economists as, say, the definition of nitrogen
    is to chemists.

    <span id="bookmark1099">Where does “plastic money” like debit cards,
    credit cards, and smart money fit into this picture? A</span>
    **debit card**, like a check, is an instruction to the user’s bank
    to transfer money directly and immediately from your bank account to
    the seller. It is important to note that in our definition of money,
    it is *checkable deposits* that are money, not the paper check or
    the debit card. Although you can make a purchase with a **credit
    card**, the financial institution does not consider it money but
    rather a short term loan from the credit card company to you. When
    you make a credit card purchase, the credit card company immediately
    transfers money from its checking account to the seller, and at the
    end of the month, the credit card company sends you a bill for what
    you have charged that month. Until you pay the credit card bill, you
    have effectively borrowed money from the credit card company. With a
    **smart card**, you can store a certain value of money on the card
    and then use the card to make purchases. Some “smart cards” used for
    specific purposes, like long-distance phone calls or making
    purchases at a campus bookstore and cafeteria, are not really all
    that smart, because you can only use them for certain purchases or
    in certain places.<span id="bookmark1100">‌</span><span
    id="bookmark1101">‌</span>

    In short, credit cards, debit cards, and smart cards are different
    ways to move money when you make a purchase. However, having more
    credit cards or debit cards does not change the quantity of money in
    the economy, any more than printing more checks increases the amount
    of money in your checking account.

    One key message underlying this discussion of M1 and M2 is that
    money in a modern economy is not just paper bills and coins.
    Instead, money is closely linked to bank accounts. The banking
    system largely conducts macroeconomic policies concerning money. The
    next section explains how banks function and how a nation’s banking
    system has the power to create money.

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Explain how banks act as intermediaries between savers and
        borrowers

        credit unions

    Somebody once asked the late bank robber named Willie Sutton why he
    robbed banks. He answered: “That’s where the money is.” While this
    may have been true at one time, from the perspective of modern
    economists, Sutton is both right and wrong. He is wrong because the
    overwhelming majority of money in the economy is not in the form of
    currency sitting in vaults or drawers at banks, waiting for a robber
    to appear. Most money is in the form of bank accounts, which exist
    only as electronic records on computers. From a broader perspective,
    however, the bank robber was more right than he may have known.
    Banking is intimately interconnected with money and consequently,
    with the broader economy.

    Banks make it far easier for a complex economy to carry out the
    extraordinary range of transactions that occur in goods, labor, and
    financial capital markets. Imagine for a moment what the economy
    would be like if everybody had to make all payments in cash. When
    shopping for a large purchase or going on vacation you might need to
    carry hundreds of dollars in a pocket or purse. Even small
    businesses would need stockpiles of cash to pay workers and to
    purchase supplies. A bank allows people and businesses to store this
    money in either a checking account or savings account, for example,
    and then withdraw this money as needed through the use of a direct
    withdrawal, writing a check, or using a debit card.

    <span id="bookmark1103">Banks are a critical intermediary in what we
    call the</span> **payment system**, which helps an economy exchange
    goods and services for money or other financial assets. Also, those
    with extra money that they would like to save can store their money
    in a bank rather than look for an individual who is willing to
    borrow it from them and then repay them at a later date. Those who
    want to borrow money can go directly to a bank rather than trying to
    find someone to lend them cash. **Transaction costs** are the costs
    associated with finding a lender or a borrower for this money. Thus,
    banks lower transactions costs and act as financial
    intermediaries—they bring savers and borrowers together. Along with
    making transactions much safer and easier, banks also play a key
    role in creating money.<span id="bookmark1104">‌</span>

    Banks as Financial Intermediaries

    <span id="bookmark1105">An “intermediary” is one who stands between
    two other parties. Banks are a</span> **financial
    intermediary**—that is, an institution that operates between a saver
    who deposits money in a bank and a borrower who receives a loan from
    that bank. Financial intermediaries include other institutions in
    the financial market such as insurance companies and pension funds,
    but we will not include them in this discussion because they are not
    **depository institutions**, which are institutions that accept
    money *deposits*
    <a href="#bookmark1107" class="s34">and then use these to make loans. All the deposited funds mingle in one big pool, which the financial institution then lends.</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1107" class="a">Figure 14.4</a><span class="s54">
    </span>illustrates the position of banks as financial
    intermediaries, with deposits flowing into a bank and loans flowing
    out. Of course, when banks make loans to firms, the banks will try
    to funnel financial capital to healthy businesses that have good
    prospects for repaying the loans, not<span
    id="bookmark1106">‌</span>

      

      

    to firms that are suffering losses and may be unable to repay.

    Savers place deposits with banks, and then receive interest payments
    and withdraw money. Borrowers receive loans from banks and repay the
    loans with interest. In turn, banks return money to savers in the
    form of withdrawals, which also include interest payments from banks
    to savers.</span>

    How are banks, savings and loans, and credit unions related?

    Banks have a couple of close cousins: savings institutions and
    credit unions. Banks, as we explained, receive deposits from
    individuals and businesses and make loans with the money. Savings
    institutions are also sometimes called “savings and loans” or
    “thrifts.” They also take loans and make deposits. However, from the
    1930s until the 1980s, federal law limited how much interest savings
    institutions were allowed to pay to depositors. They were also
    required to make most of their loans in the form of housing-related
    loans, either to homebuyers or to real-estate developers and
    builders.

    A credit union is a nonprofit financial institution that its members
    own and run. Members of each credit union decide who is eligible to
    be a member. Usually, potential members would be everyone in a
    certain community, or groups of employees, or members of a certain
    organization. The credit union accepts deposits from members and
    focuses on making loans back to its members. While there are more
    credit unions than banks and more banks than savings and loans, the
    total assets of credit unions are growing.

    In 2008, there were 7,085 banks. Due to the bank failures of
    2007–2009 and bank mergers, there were 5,571 banks in the United
    States at the end of the fourth quarter in 2014. According to the
    Credit Union National Association, as of December 2014 there were
    6,535 credit unions with assets totaling $1.1 billion. A day of
    “Transfer Your Money” took place in 2009 out of general public
    disgust with big bank bailouts. People were encouraged to transfer
    their deposits to credit unions. This has grown into the ongoing
    Move Your Money Project. Consequently, some now hold deposits as
    large as $50 billion. However, as of 2013, the 12 largest banks
    (0.2%) controlled 69 percent of all banking assets, according to the
    Dallas Federal Reserve.

    <span id="bookmark1108">A Bank’s Balance Sheet</span>

    <span id="bookmark1109">A</span> **balance sheet** is an accounting
    tool that lists assets and liabilities. An **asset** is something of
    value that you own and you can use to produce something. For
    example, you can use the cash you own to pay your tuition. If you
    own a home, this is also an asset. A **liability** is a debt or
    something you owe. Many people borrow money to buy homes. In this
    case, a home is the asset, but the mortgage is the liability. The
    **net worth** is the asset value minus how much is owed (the
    liability). A bank’s balance sheet operates in much the same way. A
    bank’s net worth as **bank capital**. We also refer to a bank has
    assets such as cash held in its vaults, monies that the bank holds
    at the Federal Reserve bank<span id="bookmark1110">‌</span><span
    id="bookmark1111">‌</span><span id="bookmark1112">‌</span>

      

      

    (called “reserves”), loans that it makes to customers, and bonds.

    <a href="#bookmark1114" id="bookmark1113" class="a">Figure 14.5</a><span
    class="s54"> </span>illustrates a hypothetical and simplified
    balance sheet for the Safe and Secure Bank. Because of the two-
    column format of the balance sheet, with the T-shape formed by the
    vertical line down the middle and the horizontal line under “Assets”
    and “Liabilities,” we sometimes call it a **T-account**.

      

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_300.jpg" width="606" height="67" alt="image" />

    <span id="bookmark1114">Figure 14.5 A Balance Sheet for the Safe and
    Secure Bank</span>

      

    The “T” in a T-account separates the assets of a firm, on the left,
    from its liabilities, on the right. All firms use T- accounts,
    though most are much more complex. For a bank, the assets are the
    financial instruments that either the bank is holding (its reserves)
    or those instruments where other parties owe money to the bank—like
    loans made by the bank and U.S. Government Securities, such as U.S.
    treasury bonds purchased by the bank. Liabilities are what the bank
    owes to others. Specifically, the bank owes any deposits made in the
    bank to those who have made them. The net worth of the bank is the
    total assets minus total liabilities. Net worth is included on the
    liabilities side to have the T account balance to zero. For a
    healthy business, net worth will be positive. For a bankrupt firm,
    net worth will be negative. In either case, on a bank’s T-account,
    assets will always equal liabilities plus net worth.

    <a href="#bookmark1114" class="s34">When bank customers deposit money into a checking account, savings account, or a certificate of deposit, the bank views these deposits as liabilities. After all, the bank owes these deposits to its customers, when the customers wish to withdraw their money. In the example in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1114" class="a">Figure</a> 14.5<span class="p">,
    the Safe and Secure Bank holds $10 million in deposits.</span>

    <a href="#bookmark1114" id="bookmark1115" class="s34">Loans are the first category of bank assets in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1114" class="a">Figure</a> 14.5<span class="p">.
    Say that a family takes out a 30-year mortgage loan to purchase a
    house, which means that the borrower will repay the loan over the
    next 30 years. This loan is clearly an asset from the bank’s
    perspective, because the borrower has a legal obligation to make
    payments to the bank over time. However, in practical terms, how can
    we measure the value of the mortgage loan that the borrower is
    paying over 30 years in the present? One way of measuring the value
    of something—whether a loan or anything else—is by estimating what
    another party in the market is willing to pay for it. Many banks
    issue home loans, and charge various handling and processing fees
    for doing so, but then sell the loans to other banks or financial
    institutions who collect the loan payments. We call the market where
    financial institutions make loans to borrowers the primary loan
    market, while the market in which financial institutions buy and
    sell these loans is the secondary loan market.</span>

    One key factor that affects what financial institutions are willing
    to pay for a loan, when they buy it in the secondary loan market, is
    the perceived riskiness of the loan: that is, given the borrower's
    characteristics, such as income level and whether the local economy
    is performing strongly, what proportion of loans of this type will
    the borrower repay? The greater the risk that a borrower will not
    repay loan, the less that any financial institution will pay to
    acquire the loan. Another key factor is to compare the interest rate
    the financial institution charged on the original loan with the
    current interest rate in the economy. If the original loan requires
    the borrower to pay a low interest rate, but current interest rates
    are relatively high, then a financial institution will pay less to
    acquire the loan. In contrast, if the original loan requires the
    borrower to pay a high interest rate, while current interest rates
    are relatively low, then a financial institution will pay more to
    acquire the loan. For the Safe and Secure Bank in this example, the
    total value of its loans if they sold them to other financial
    institutions in the secondary market is $5 million.

    <span id="bookmark1116">The second category of bank asset is bonds,
    which are a common mechanism for borrowing, used by the federal and
    local government, and also private companies, and nonprofit
    organizations. A bank takes some of the money it has received in
    deposits and uses the money to buy bonds—typically bonds issued that
    the U.S. government issues. Government bonds are low-risk because
    the government is virtually certain to pay off the bond, albeit at a
    low rate of interest. These bonds are an asset for banks in the same
    way that loans are an asset: The bank will receive a stream of
    payments in the future. In our example, the Safe and Secure Bank
    holds bonds worth a total value of $4 million.</span>

    <span id="bookmark1117">The final entry under assets is</span>
    **reserves**<a href="#bookmark1177" class="s34">, which is money that the bank keeps on hand, and that it does not lend or invest in bonds—and thus does not lead to interest payments. The Federal Reserve requires that banks keep a certain percentage of depositors’ money on “reserve,” which means either in their vaults or at the Federal Reserve Bank. We call this a reserve requirement. (</a><a href="#bookmark1177" class="a">Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation</a><span
    class="s54"> </span>will explain how the level of these required
    reserves are one policy tool that governments have to influence bank
    behavior.) Additionally, banks may also want to keep a certain
    amount of reserves on hand in excess of what is required. The Safe
    and Secure Bank is holding

      

      

    $2 million in reserves.

    style=" color: #000;">from Paul Solman’s “Making Sense of Financial
    News.”</span>

    <a href="#bookmark1114" class="s34">We define net worth of a bank as its total assets minus its total liabilities. For the Safe and Secure Bank in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1114" class="a">Figure</a> 14.5<span class="p">,
    net worth is equal to $1 million; that is, $11 million in assets
    minus $10 million in liabilities. For a financially healthy bank,
    the net worth will be positive. If a bank has negative net worth and
    depositors tried to withdraw their money, the bank would not be able
    to give all depositors their money.</span>

      

      

    How Banks Go Bankrupt

    A bank that is bankrupt will have a negative net worth, meaning its
    assets will be worth less than its liabilities. How can this happen?
    Again, looking at the balance sheet helps to explain.

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_302.png" width="624" height="51" alt="image" />

    What led to the 2008–2009 financial crisis?

    Many banks make mortgage loans so that people can buy a home, but
    then do not keep the loans on their books as an asset. Instead, the
    bank sells the loan. These loans are “securitized,” which means that
    they are bundled together into a financial security that a financial
    institution sells to investors. Investors in these mortgage-backed
    securities receive a rate of return based on the level of payments
    that people make on all the mortgages that stand behind the
    security.

    <span id="bookmark1118">Securitization offers certain advantages. If
    a bank makes most of its loans in a local area, then the bank may be
    financially vulnerable if the local economy declines, so that many
    people are unable to make their payments. However, if a bank sells
    its local loans, and then buys a mortgage-backed security based on
    home loans in many parts of the country, it can avoid exposure to
    local financial risks. (In the simple example in the text, banks
    just own “bonds.” In reality, banks can own a number of financial
    instruments, as long as these financial investments are safe enough
    to satisfy the government bank regulators.) From the standpoint of a
    local homebuyer, securitization offers the benefit that a local bank
    does not need to have significant extra funds to make a loan,
    because the bank is only planning to hold that loan for a short
    time, before selling the loan so that it can pool it into a
    financial security.</span>

    <a href="#bookmark1114" class="s34">A well-run bank will assume that a small percentage of borrowers will not repay their loans on time, or at all, and factor these missing payments into its planning. Remember, the calculations of the banks' expenses every year include a factor for loans that borrowers do not repay, and the value of a bank’s loans on its balance sheet assumes a certain level of riskiness because some customers will not repay loans. Even if a bank expects a certain number of loan defaults, it will suffer if the number of loan defaults is much greater than expected, as can happen during a recession. For example, if the Safe and Secure Bank in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1114" class="a">Figure 14.5</a> <span
    class="p">experienced a wave of unexpected defaults, so that its
    loans declined in value from $5 million to $3 million, then the
    assets of the Safe and Secure Bank would decline so that the bank
    had negative net worth.</span>

      

      

    <span id="bookmark1119">However, securitization also offers one
    potentially large disadvantage. If a bank plans to hold a mortgage
    loan as an asset, the bank has an incentive to scrutinize the
    borrower carefully to ensure that the customer is likely to repay
    the loan. However, a bank that plans to sell the loan may be less
    careful in making the loan in the first place. The bank will be more
    willing to make what we call “subprime loans,” which are loans that
    have characteristics like low or zero down-payment, little scrutiny
    of whether the borrower has a reliable income, and sometimes low
    payments for the first year or two that will be followed by much
    higher payments. Economists dubbed some financial institutions that
    made subprime loans in the mid-2000s NINJA loans: loans that
    financial institutions made even though the borrower had
    demonstrated No Income, No Job, or Assets.</span>

    Financial institutions typically sold these subprime loans and
    turned them into financial securities—but with a twist. The idea was
    that if losses occurred on these mortgage-backed securities, certain
    investors would agree to take the first, say, 5% of such losses.
    Other investors would agree to take, say, the next 5% of losses. By
    this approach, still other investors would not need to take any
    losses unless these mortgage-backed financial securities lost 25% or
    30% or more of their total value. These complex securities, along
    with other economic factors, encouraged a large expansion of
    subprime loans in the mid-2000s.

    The economic stage was now set for a banking crisis. Banks thought
    they were buying only ultra-safe securities, because even though the
    securities were ultimately backed by risky subprime mortgages, the
    banks only invested in the part of those securities where they were
    protected from small or moderate levels of losses. However, as
    housing prices fell after 2007, and the deepening recession made it
    harder for many people to make their mortgage payments, many banks
    found that their mortgage-backed financial assets could be worth
    much less than they had expected—and so the banks were faced with
    staring bankruptcy. In the 2008–2011 period, 318 banks failed in the
    United States.

      

    <span id="bookmark1120">The risk of an unexpectedly high level of
    loan defaults can be especially difficult for banks because a bank’s
    liabilities, namely it customers' deposits. Customers can withdraw
    funds quickly but many of the bank’s assets like loans and bonds
    will only be repaid over years or even decades. This</span>
    **asset-liability time mismatch**—the ability for customers to
    withdraw bank’s liabilities in the short term while customers repay
    its assets in the long term—can cause severe problems for a bank.
    For example, imagine a bank that has loaned a substantial amount of
    money at a certain interest rate, but then sees interest rates rise
    substantially. The bank can find itself in a precarious situation.
    If it does not raise the interest rate it pays to depositors, then
    deposits will flow to other institutions that offer the higher
    interest rates that are now prevailing. However, if the bank raises
    the interest rates that it pays to depositors, it may end up in a
    situation where it is paying a higher interest rate to depositors
    than it is collecting from those past loans that it at lower
    interest rates. Clearly, the bank cannot survive in the long term if
    it is paying out more in interest to depositors than it is receiving
    from borrowers.

    <span id="bookmark1121">How can banks protect themselves against an
    unexpectedly high rate of loan defaults and against the risk of an
    asset-liability time mismatch? One strategy is for a bank to</span>
    **diversify** its loans, which means lending to a variety of
    customers. For example, suppose a bank specialized in lending to a
    niche market—say, making a high proportion of its loans to
    construction companies that build offices in one downtown area. If
    that one area suffers an unexpected economic downturn, the bank will
    suffer large losses. However, if a bank loans both to consumers who
    are buying homes and cars and also to a wide range of firms in many
    industries and geographic areas, the bank is less exposed to risk.
    When a bank diversifies its loans, those categories of borrowers who
    have an unexpectedly large number of defaults will tend to be
    balanced out, according to random chance, by other borrowers who
    have an unexpectedly low number of defaults. Thus, diversification
    of loans can help banks to keep a positive net worth. However, if a
    widespread recession occurs that touches many industries and
    geographic areas, diversification will not help.

    Along with diversifying their loans, banks have several other
    strategies to reduce the risk of an unexpectedly large number of
    loan defaults. For example, banks can sell some of the loans they
    make in the secondary loan market, as we described earlier, and
    instead hold a greater share of assets in the form of government
    bonds or reserves. Nevertheless, in a lengthy recession, most banks
    will see their net worth decline because customers will not repay a
    higher share of loans in tough economic times.

      

4.  <span id="bookmark1068">|</span> <span style=" color: #3767B1;">How
    Banks Create Money</span><span id="bookmark1122">‌</span>

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Utilize the money multiplier formulate to determine how banks
        create money

    -   Analyze and create T-account balance sheets

    -   Evaluate the risks and benefits of money and banks

      

    Banks and money are intertwined. It is not just that most money is
    in the form of bank accounts. The banking system can literally
    create money through the process of making loans. Let’s see how.

    Money Creation by a Single Bank

    <a href="#bookmark1123" class="s34">Start with a hypothetical bank called Singleton Bank. The bank has $10 million in deposits. The T-account balance sheet for Singleton Bank, when it holds all of the deposits in its vaults, is in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1123" class="a">Figure</a> 14.6<span class="p">.
    At this stage, Singleton Bank is simply storing money for depositors
    and is using these deposits to make loans. In this simplified
    example, Singleton Bank cannot earn any interest income from these
    loans and cannot pay its depositors an interest rate either.</span>

      

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_303.jpg" width="606" height="45" alt="image" />

    <span id="bookmark1123">Figure 14.6 Singleton Bank’s Balance Sheet:
    Receives $10 million in Deposits</span>

      

    The Federal Reserve requires Singleton Bank to keep $1 million on
    reserve (10% of total deposits). It will loan out the remaining $9
    million. By loaning out the $9 million and charging interest, it
    will be able to make interest payments to depositors and earn
    interest income for Singleton Bank (for now, we will keep it simple
    and not put interest income on the balance sheet). Instead of
    becoming just a storage place for deposits, Singleton Bank can
    become a financial intermediary between savers and borrowers.

    <a href="#bookmark1124" class="s34">This change in business plan alters Singleton Bank’s balance sheet, as</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1124" class="a">Figure 14.7</a> <span
    class="p">shows. Singleton’s assets have changed. It now has $1
    million in reserves and a loan to Hank’s Auto Supply of $9 million.

    <a href="#bookmark1125" class="s34">Singleton Bank lends $9 million to Hank’s Auto Supply. The bank records this loan by making an entry on the balance sheet to indicate that it has made a loan. This loan is an asset, because it will generate interest income for the bank. Of course, the loan officer will not allow let Hank to walk out of the bank with $9 million in cash. The bank issues Hank’s Auto Supply a cashier’s check for the $9 million. Hank deposits the loan in his regular checking account with First National. The deposits at First National rise by $9 million and its reserves also rise by $9 million, as</a>

    Making loans that are deposited into a demand deposit account
    increases the M1 money supply. Remember the definition of M1
    includes checkable (demand) deposits, which one can easily use as a
    medium of exchange to buy goods and services. Notice that the money
    supply is now $19 million: $10 million in deposits in Singleton bank
    and

    $9 million in deposits at First National. Obviously as Hank’s Auto
    Supply writes checks to pay its bills the deposits will draw down.
    However, the bigger picture is that a bank must hold enough money in
    reserves to meet its liabilities.

      

    The rest the bank loans out. In this example so far, bank lending
    has expanded the money supply by $9 million.

    <a href="#bookmark1126" class="s34">Now, First National must hold only 10% as required reserves ($900,000) but can lend out the other 90% ($8.1 million) in a loan to Jack’s Chevy Dealership as</a>

    <span style=" color: #000;">to learn more about how banks create
    money.</span>

    How is this money creation possible? It is possible because there
    are multiple banks in the financial system, they are required to
    hold only a fraction of their deposits, and loans end up deposited
    in other banks, which increases deposits and, in essence, the money
    supply.

      

      

    The Money Multiplier and a Multi-Bank System

    In a system with multiple banks, Singleton Bank deposited the
    initial excess reserve amount that it decided to lend to Hank’s Auto
    Supply into First National Bank, which is free to loan out $8.1
    million. If all banks loan out their excess reserves, the money
    supply will expand. In a multi-bank system, institutions determine
    the amount of money that the system can create by using the money
    multiplier. This tells us by how many times a loan will be
    “multiplied” as it is spent in the economy and then re-deposited in
    other banks.

    <span id="bookmark1128">Fortunately, a formula exists for
    calculating the total of these many rounds of lending in a banking
    system. The</span> **money multiplier formula** is:

                    1                 

    Reserve Requirement

    We then multiply the money multiplier by the change in excess
    reserves to determine the total amount of M1 money supply created in
    the banking system. See the Work it Out feature to walk through the
    multiplier calculation.

    = <u>    1</u><span class="s73"> </span>× $9 million

    0.10

    = 10 × $9 million

    = $90 million

    Step 3. Thus, we can say that, in this example, the total quantity
    of money generated in this economy after all rounds of lending are
    completed will be $90 million.

    Reserve Requirement

    Total Change in the M1 Money Supply = <u>                 1
                  </u> <span class="s73"> </span>× Excess Requirement

    Using the Money Multiplier Formula

    Using the money multiplier for the example in this text:

    Step 1. In the case of Singleton Bank, for whom the reserve
    requirement is 10% (or 0.10), the money multiplier is 1 divided by
    .10, which is equal to 10.

    Step 2. We have identified that the excess reserves are $9 million,
    so, using the formula we can determine the total change in the M1
    money supply:

    Cautions about the Money Multiplier

    <a href="#bookmark1177" class="s34">The money multiplier will depend on the proportion of reserves that the Federal Reserve Band requires banks to hold. Additionally, a bank can also choose to hold extra reserves. Banks may decide to vary how much they hold in reserves for two reasons: macroeconomic conditions and government rules. When an economy is in recession, banks are likely to hold a higher proportion of reserves because they fear that customers are less likely to repay loans when the economy is slow. The Federal Reserve may also raise or lower the required reserves held by banks as a policy move to affect the quantity of money in an economy, as</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1177" class="a">Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation</a>
    <span class="p">will discuss.</span>

    The process of how banks create money shows how the quantity of
    money in an economy is closely linked to the quantity of lending or
    credit in the economy. All the money in the economy, except for the
    original reserves, is a result of bank loans that institutions
    repeatedly re-deposit and loan.

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_310.png" width="624" height="220" alt="image" />

    <a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/moneymyth" class="s84">Watch a</a>
    <a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/moneymyth" class="s41">video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/moneymyth)</a>
    <span style=" color: #000;">of Jem Bendell discussing “The Money
    Myth.”</span>

    Finally, the money multiplier depends on people re-depositing the
    money that they receive in the banking system. If people instead
    store their cash in safe-deposit boxes or in shoeboxes hidden in
    their closets, then banks cannot recirculate the money in the form
    of loans. Central banks have an incentive to assure that bank
    deposits are safe because if people worry that they may lose their
    bank deposits, they may start holding more money in cash, instead of
    depositing it in banks, and the quantity of loans in an economy will
    decline. Low-income countries have what economists sometimes refer
    to as “mattress savings,” or money that people are hiding in their
    homes because they do not trust banks. When mattress savings in an
    economy are substantial, banks cannot lend out those funds and the
    money multiplier cannot operate as effectively. The overall quantity
    of money and loans in such an economy will decline.

      

      

    Money and Banks—Benefits and Dangers

    Money and banks are marvelous social inventions that help a modern
    economy to function. Compared with the alternative of barter, money
    makes market exchanges vastly easier in goods, labor, and financial
    markets. Banking makes money still more effective in facilitating
    exchanges in goods and labor markets. Moreover, the process of banks
    making loans in financial capital markets is intimately tied to the
    creation of money.

    The Many Disguises of Money: From Cowries to Bit Coins

    The global economy has come a long way since it started using cowrie
    shells as currency. We have moved away from commodity and
    commodity-backed paper money to fiat currency. As technology and
    global integration increases, the need for paper currency is
    diminishing, too. Every day, we witness the increased use of debit
    and credit cards.

    The latest creation and perhaps one of the purest forms of fiat
    money is the Bitcoin. Bitcoins are a digital currency that allows
    users to buy goods and services online. Customers can purchase
    products and services such as videos and books using Bitcoins. This
    currency is not backed by any commodity nor has any government
    decreed as legal tender, yet customers use it as a medium of
    exchange and can store its value (online at least). It is also
    unregulated by any central bank, but is created online through
    people solving very complicated mathematics problems and receiving
    payment afterward. Bitcoin.org is an information source if you are
    curious. Bitcoins are a relatively new type of money. At present,
    because it is not sanctioned as a legal currency by any country nor
    regulated by any central bank, it lends itself for use in illegal as
    well as legal trading activities. As technology increases and the
    need to reduce transactions costs associated with using traditional
    forms of money increases, Bitcoins or some sort of digital currency
    may replace our dollar bill, just as man replaced the cowrie shell.

    However, the extraordinary economic gains that are possible through
    money and banking also suggest some possible corresponding dangers.
    If banks are not working well, it sets off a decline in convenience
    and safety of transactions throughout the economy. If the banks are
    under financial stress, because of a widespread decline in the value
    of their assets, loans may become far less available, which can deal
    a crushing blow to sectors of the economy that depend on borrowed
    money like business investment, home construction, and car
    manufacturing. The 2008–2009 Great Recession illustrated this
    pattern.

    KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY

      

    1.  <a href="#bookmark1075" class="a">Defining Money by Its</a>
        [Functions](#bookmark1075)

        Money is what people in a society regularly use when purchasing
        or selling goods and services. If money were not available,
        people would need to barter with each other, meaning that each
        person would need to identify others with whom they have a
        double coincidence of wants—that is, each party has a specific
        good or service that the other desires. Money serves several
        functions: a medium of exchange, a unit of account, a store of
        value, and a standard of deferred payment. There are two types
        of money: commodity money, which is an item used as money, but
        which also has value from its use as something other than money;
        and fiat money, which has no intrinsic value, but is declared by
        a government to be the country's legal tender.

          

    2.  <a href="#bookmark1087" class="a">Measuring Money: Currency, M1, and</a>
        [M2](#bookmark1087)

        We measure money with several definitions: M1 includes currency
        and money in checking accounts (demand deposits). Traveler’s
        checks are also a component of M1, but are declining in use. M2
        includes all of M1, plus savings deposits, time deposits like
        certificates of deposit, and money market funds.

          

    3.  <a href="#bookmark1102" class="a">The Role of</a>
        [Banks](#bookmark1102)

        Banks facilitate using money for transactions in the economy
        because people and firms can use bank accounts when selling or
        buying goods and services, when paying a worker or receiving
        payment, and when saving money or receiving a loan. In the
        financial capital market, banks are financial intermediaries;
        that is, they operate between savers who supply financial
        capital and borrowers who demand loans. A balance sheet
        (sometimes called a T-account) is an accounting tool which lists
        assets in one column and liabilities in another. The bank's
        liabilities are its deposits. The bank's assets include its
        loans, its ownership of bonds, and its reserves (which it does
        not loan out). We calculate a bank's net worth by subtracting
        its liabilities from its assets. Banks run a risk of negative
        net worth if the value of their assets declines. The value of
        assets can decline because of an unexpectedly high number of
        defaults on loans, or if interest rates rise and the bank
        suffers an asset-liability time mismatch in which the bank is
        receiving a low interest rate on its long-term loans but must
        pay the currently higher market interest rate to attract
        depositors. Banks

          

          

        can protect themselves against these risks by choosing to
        diversify their loans or to hold a greater proportion of their
        assets in bonds and reserves. If banks hold only a fraction of
        their deposits as reserves, then the process of banks’ lending
        money, re-depositing those loans in banks, and the banks making
        additional loans will create money in the economy.

          

    4.  <a href="#bookmark1122" class="a">How Banks Create</a>
        [Money](#bookmark1122)

We define the money multiplier as the quantity of money that the banking
system can generate from each $1 of bank reserves. The formula for
calculating the multiplier is 1/reserve ratio, where the reserve ratio
is the fraction of deposits that the bank wishes to hold as reserves.
The quantity of money in an economy and the quantity of credit for loans
are inextricably intertwined. The network of banks making loans, people
making deposits, and banks making more loans creates much of the money
in an economy.

The Problem of the Zero Percent Interest Rate Lower Bound

Most economists believe that monetary policy (the manipulation of
interest rates and credit conditions by a nation’s central bank) has a
powerful influence on a nation’s economy. Monetary policy works when the
central bank reduces interest rates and makes credit more available. As
a result, business investment and other types of spending increase,
causing GDP and employment to grow.

However, what if the interest rates banks pay are close to zero already?
They cannot be made negative, can they? That would mean that lenders pay
borrowers for the privilege of taking their money. Yet, this was the
situation the U.S. Federal Reserve found itself in at the end of the
2008–2009 recession. The federal funds rate, which is the interest rate
for banks that the Federal Reserve targets with its monetary policy, was
slightly above 5% in 2007. By 2009, it had fallen to 0.16%.

The Federal Reserve’s situation was further complicated because fiscal
policy, the other major tool for managing the economy, was constrained
by fears that the federal budget deficit and the public debt were
already too high. What were the Federal Reserve’s options? How could the
Federal Reserve use monetary policy to stimulate the economy? The
answer, as we will see in this chapter, was to change the rules of the
game.

#### Introduction to Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation

In this chapter, you will learn about:

-   The Federal Reserve Banking System and Central Banks

-   Bank Regulation

-   How a Central Bank Executes Monetary Policy

-   Monetary Policy and Economic Outcomes

-   Pitfalls for Monetary Policy

  

Money, loans, and banks are all interconnected. Money is deposited in
bank accounts, which is then loaned to businesses, individuals, and
other banks. When the interlocking system of money, loans, and banks
works well, economic transactions smoothly occur in goods and labor
markets and savers are connected with borrowers. If the money and
banking system does not operate smoothly, the economy can either fall
into recession or suffer prolonged inflation.

The government of every country has public policies that support the
system of money, loans, and banking. However, these policies do not
always work perfectly. This chapter discusses how monetary policy works
and what may prevent it from working perfectly.

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Explain the structure and organization of the U.S. Federal

    <span id="bookmark1179">In making decisions about the money supply,
    a central bank decides whether to raise or lower interest rates and,
    in this way, to influence macroeconomic policy, whose goal is low
    unemployment and low inflation. The central bank is also responsible
    for regulating all or part of the nation’s banking system to protect
    bank depositors and insure the health of the bank’s balance
    sheet.</span><span id="bookmark1180">‌</span>

    <span id="bookmark1181">We call the organization responsible for
    conducting monetary policy and ensuring that a nation’s financial
    system operates smoothly the</span> **central bank**. Most nations
    have central banks or currency boards. Some prominent central banks
    around the world include the European Central Bank, the Bank of
    Japan, and the Bank of England. In the United States, we call the
    central bank the Federal Reserve—often abbreviated as just “the
    Fed.” This section explains the U.S. Federal Reserve's organization
    and identifies the major central bank's responsibilities.<span

    Structure/Organization of the Federal Reserve

    Unlike most central banks, the Federal Reserve is
    semi-decentralized, mixing government appointees with representation
    from private-sector banks. At the national level, it is run by a
    Board of Governors, consisting of seven members appointed by the
    President of the United States and confirmed by the Senate.
    Appointments are for 14-year terms and they are arranged so that one
    term expires January 31 of every even-numbered year. The purpose of
    the long and staggered terms is to insulate the Board of Governors
    as much as possible from political pressure so that governors can
    make policy decisions based only on their economic merits.
    Additionally, except when filling an unfinished term, each member
    only serves one term, further insulating decision-making from
    politics. The Fed's policy decisions do not require congressional
    approval, and the President cannot ask for a Federal Reserve
    Governor to resign as the President can with cabinet positions.

    One member of the Board of Governors is designated as the Chair. For
    example, from 1987 until early 2006, the Chair was Alan Greenspan.
    From 2006 until 2014, Ben Bernanke held the post. The current Chair,
    Janet Yellen, has made

It is not even the President of the United States. The answer is the Chair of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. In early 2014, Janet L. Yellen, (</a><a href="#bookmark1184" class="s43">Figure</a>
    15.2<span class="s37">) became the first woman to hold this post.
    The media had described Yellen as “perhaps the most qualified Fed
    chair in history.” With a Ph.D. in economics from Yale University,
    Yellen has taught macroeconomics at Harvard, the London School of
    Economics, and most recently at the University of California at
    Berkeley. From 2004–2010, Yellen was President of the Federal
    Reserve Bank of San Francisco. Not an ivory tower economist, Yellen
    became one of the few economists who warned about a possible bubble
    in the housing market, more than two years before the financial
    crisis occurred. Yellen served on the Board of Governors of the
    Federal Reserve twice, most recently as Vice Chair. She also spent
    two years as Chair of the President’s Council of Economic Advisors.
    If experience and credentials mean anything, Yellen is likely to be
    an effective Fed chair.</span>

    What Does a Central Bank Do?

    The Federal Reserve, like most central banks, is designed to perform
    three important functions:

    1.  To conduct monetary policy

    2.  To promote stability of the financial system

    3.  To provide banking services to commercial banks and other
        depository institutions, and to provide banking services to the
        federal government.

        The first two functions are sufficiently important that we will
        discuss them in their own modules. The third function we will
        discuss here.

        The Federal Reserve provides many of the same services to banks
        as banks provide to their customers. For example, all commercial
        banks have an account at the Fed where they deposit reserves.
        Similarly, banks can obtain loans from the Fed through the
        “discount window” facility, which we will discuss in more detail
        later. The Fed is also responsible for check processing. When
        you write a check, for example, to buy groceries, the grocery
        store deposits the check in its bank account. Then, the grocery
        store's bank returns the physical check (or an image of that
        actual check) to your bank, after which it transfers funds from
        your bank account to the grocery store's account. The Fed is
        responsible for each of these actions.

        On a more mundane level, the Federal Reserve ensures that enough
        currency and coins are circulating through the financial system
        to meet public demands. For example, each year the Fed increases
        the amount of currency available in banks around the Christmas
        shopping season and reduces it again in January.

        Finally, the Fed is responsible for assuring that banks are in
        compliance with a wide variety of consumer protection laws. For
        example, banks are forbidden from discriminating on the basis of
        age, race, sex, or marital status. Banks are also required to
        disclose publicly information about the loans they make for
        buying houses and how they distribute

          

          

        the loans geographically, as well as by sex and race of the loan
        applicants.

          

2.  <span id="bookmark1171">|</span> <span style=" color: #3767B1;">Bank
    Regulation</span><span id="bookmark1187">‌</span>

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Discuss the relationship between bank regulation and monetary
        policy

    -   Explain bank supervision

    -   Explain how deposit insurance and lender of last resort are two
        strategies to protect against bank runs

      

    <span id="bookmark1188">A safe and stable national financial system
    is a critical concern of the Federal Reserve. The goal is not only
    to protect individuals’ savings, but to protect the integrity of the
    financial system itself. This esoteric task is usually behind the
    scenes, but came into view during the 2008–2009 financial crisis,
    when for a brief period of time, critical parts of the financial
    system failed and firms became unable to obtain financing for
    ordinary parts of their business. Imagine if suddenly you were
    unable to access the money in your bank accounts because your checks
    were not accepted for payment and your debit cards were declined.
    This gives an idea of a failure of the payments/financial
    system.</span>

    <a href="#bookmark1071" id="bookmark1189" class="s34">Bank regulation is intended to maintain banks' solvency by avoiding excessive risk. Regulation falls into a number of categories, including reserve requirements, capital requirements, and restrictions on the types of investments banks may make. In</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1071" class="a">Money and</a> Banking<span
    class="p">, we learned that banks are required to hold a minimum
    percentage of their deposits on hand as reserves. “On hand” is a bit
    of a misnomer because, while a portion of bank reserves are held as
    cash in the bank, the majority are held in the bank’s account at the
    Federal Reserve, and their purpose is to cover desired withdrawals
    by depositors. Another part of bank regulation is restrictions on
    the types of investments banks are allowed to make. Banks are
    permitted to make loans to businesses, individuals, and other banks.
    They can purchase U.S. Treasury securities but, to protect
    depositors, they are not permitted to invest in the stock market or
    other assets that are perceived as too risky.</span><span
    id="bookmark1190">‌</span>

    Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation.”</span>

    <span id="bookmark1191">Bank capital is the difference between a
    bank’s assets and its liabilities. In other words, it is a bank’s
    net worth. A bank must have positive net worth; otherwise it is
    insolvent or bankrupt, meaning it would not have enough assets to
    pay back its liabilities. Regulation requires that banks maintain a
    minimum net worth, usually expressed as a percent of their assets,
    to protect their depositors and other creditors.</span>

      

      

    Bank Supervision

    Several government agencies monitor banks' balance sheets to make
    sure they have positive net worth and are not taking too high a
    level of risk. Within the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the
    Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has a national staff of
    bank examiners who conduct on-site reviews of the 1,500 or so of the
    largest national banks. The bank examiners also review any foreign
    banks that have branches in the United States. The Office of the
    Comptroller of the Currency also monitors and regulates about 800
    savings and loan institutions.

    <span id="bookmark1192">The National Credit Union Administration
    (NCUA) supervises credit unions, which are nonprofit banks that
    their</span>

      

      

    members run and own. There are over 6,000 credit unions in the U.S.
    economy, although the typical credit union is small compared to most
    banks.

    The Federal Reserve also has some responsibility for supervising
    financial institutions. For example, we call conglomerate firms that
    own banks and other businesses “bank holding companies.” While other
    regulators like the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
    supervises the banks, the Federal Reserve supervises the holding
    companies.

    When bank supervision (and bank-like institutions such as savings
    and loans and credit unions) works well, most banks will remain
    financially healthy most of the time. If the bank supervisors find
    that a bank has low or negative net worth, or is making too high a
    proportion of risky loans, they can require that the bank change its
    behavior—or, in extreme cases, even force the bank to close or be
    sold to a financially healthy bank.

    <a href="#bookmark1071" id="bookmark1193" class="s34">Bank supervision can run into both practical and political questions. The practical question is that measuring the value of a bank’s assets is not always straightforward. As we discussed in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1071" class="a">Money and</a> Banking<span
    class="p">, a bank’s assets are its loans, and the value of these
    assets depends on estimates about the risk that customers will not
    repay these loans. These issues can become even more complex when a
    bank makes loans to banks or firms in other countries, or arranges
    financial deals that are much more complex than a basic loan.</span>

    The political question arises because a bank supervisor's decision
    to require a bank to close or to change its financial investments is
    often controversial, and the bank supervisor often comes under
    political pressure from the bank's owners and the local politicians
    to keep quiet and back off.

    For example, many observers have pointed out that Japan’s banks were
    in deep financial trouble through most of the 1990s; however,
    nothing substantial had been done about it by the early 2000s. A
    similar unwillingness to confront problems with struggling banks is
    visible across the rest of the world, in East Asia, Latin America,
    Eastern Europe, Russia, and elsewhere.

    In the United States, the government passed laws in the 1990s
    requiring that bank supervisors make their findings open and public,
    and that they act as soon as they identify a problem. However, as
    many U.S. banks were staggered by the 2008-2009 recession, critics
    of the bank regulators asked pointed questions about why the
    regulators had not foreseen the banks' financial shakiness earlier,
    before such large losses had a chance to accumulate.

    Bank Runs

    <a href="#bookmark1195" id="bookmark1194" class="s34">Back in the nineteenth century and during the first few decades of the twentieth century (around and during the Great Depression), putting your money in a bank could be nerve-wracking. Imagine that the net worth of your bank became negative, so that the bank’s assets were not enough to cover its liabilities. In this situation, whoever withdrew their deposits first received all of their money, and those who did not rush to the bank quickly enough, lost their money. We call depositors racing to the bank to withdraw their deposits, as</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1195" class="a">Figure 15.4</a><span class="s54">
    </span>shows a **bank run**. In the movie *It’s a Wonderful Life*,
    the bank manager, played by Jimmy Stewart, faces a mob of worried
    bank depositors who want to withdraw their money, but manages to
    allay their fears by allowing some of them to withdraw a portion of
    their deposits—using the money from his own pocket that was supposed
    to pay for his honeymoon.

    class="s37">Bank runs during the Great Depression only served to
    worsen the economic situation. (Credit: National Archives and
    Records Administration)</span>

      

    The risk of bank runs created instability in the banking system.
    Even a rumor that a bank might experience negative net worth could
    trigger a bank run and, in a bank run, even healthy banks could be
    destroyed. Because a bank loans out most of the money it receives,
    and because it keeps only limited reserves on hand, a bank run of
    any size would quickly drain any of the bank’s available cash. When
    the bank had no cash remaining, it only intensified the fears of
    remaining depositors that they could lose their money. Moreover, a
    bank run at one bank often triggered a chain reaction of runs on
    other banks. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century,
    bank runs were typically not the original cause of a recession—but
    they could make a recession much worse.

    Deposit Insurance

    <span id="bookmark1196">To protect against bank runs, Congress has
    put two strategies into place:</span> **deposit insurance** and the
    lender of last resort. Deposit insurance is an insurance system that
    makes sure depositors in a bank do not lose their money, even if the
    bank goes bankrupt. About 70 countries around the world, including
    all of the major economies, have deposit insurance programs. In the
    United States, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is
    responsible for deposit insurance. Banks pay an insurance premium to
    the FDIC. The insurance premium is based on the bank’s level of
    deposits, and then adjusted according to the riskiness of a bank’s
    financial situation. In 2009, for example, a fairly safe bank with a
    high net worth might have paid 10–20 cents in insurance premiums for
    every $100 in bank deposits, while a risky bank with very low net
    worth might have paid 50–60 cents for every $100 in bank
    deposits.<span id="bookmark1197">‌</span>

    Bank examiners from the FDIC evaluate the banks' balance sheets,
    looking at the asset and liability values to determine the risk
    level. The FDIC provides deposit insurance for about 5,898 banks (as
    of the end of February 2017). Even if a bank fails, the government
    guarantees that depositors will receive up to $250,000 of their
    money in each account, which is enough for almost all individuals,
    although not sufficient for many businesses. Since the United States
    enacted deposit insurance in the 1930s, no one has lost any of their
    insured deposits. Bank runs no longer happen at insured banks.

    Lender of Last Resort

    <span id="bookmark1198">The problem with bank runs is not that
    insolvent banks will fail; they are, after all, bankrupt and need to
    be shut down. The problem is that bank runs can cause solvent banks
    to fail and spread to the rest of the financial system. To prevent
    this, the Fed stands ready to lend to banks and other financial
    institutions when they cannot obtain funds from anywhere else. This
    is known as the</span> **lender of last resort** role. For banks,
    the central bank acting as a lender of last resort helps to
    reinforce the effect of deposit insurance and to reassure bank
    customers that they will not lose their money.

    The lender of last resort task can arise in other financial crises,
    as well. During the 1987 stock market crash panic, when U.S. stock
    values fell by 25% in a single day, the Federal Reserve made a
    number of short-term emergency loans so that the financial system
    could keep functioning. During the 2008-2009 recession, we can
    interpret the Fed's “quantitative easing” policies (discussed below)
    as a willingness to make short-term credit available as needed in a

      

      

    time when the banking and financial system was under stress.

    a Central Bank Executes Monetary Policy</span><span

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Explain the reason for open market operations

    -   Evaluate reserve requirements and discount rates

    -   Interpret and show bank activity through balance sheets

      

    <span id="bookmark1200">The Federal Reserve's most important
    function is to conduct the nation’s monetary policy. Article I,
    Section 8 of the</span>

    U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power “to coin money” and “to
    regulate the value thereof.” As part of the 1913 legislation that
    created the Federal Reserve, Congress delegated these powers to the
    Fed. Monetary policy involves managing interest rates and credit
    conditions, which influences the level of economic activity, as we
    describe in more detail below.

    A central bank has three traditional tools to implement monetary
    policy in the economy:

    -   Open market operations

    -   Changing reserve requirements

    -   Changing the discount rate

    In discussing how these three tools work, it is useful to think of
    the central bank as a “bank for banks”—that is, each private-sector
    bank has its own account at the central bank. We will discuss each
    of these monetary policy tools in the sections below.

    Open Market Operations

    <span id="bookmark1201">The most common monetary policy tool in the
    U.S. is</span> **open market operations**.These take place when the
    central bank sells or buys U.S. Treasury bonds in order to influence
    the quantity of bank reserves and the level of interest rates. The
    specific interest rate targeted in open market operations is the
    federal funds rate. The name is a bit of a misnomer since the
    federal funds rate is the interest rate that commercial banks charge
    making overnight loans to other banks. As such, it is a very short
    term interest rate, but one that reflects credit conditions in
    financial markets very well.

    <span id="bookmark1202">The</span> **Federal Open Market Committee
    (FOMC)** makes the decisions regarding these open market operations.
    The FOMC comprises seven members of the Federal Reserve’s Board of
    Governors. It also includes five voting members who the Board draws,
    on a rotating basis, from the regional Federal Reserve Banks. The
    New York district president is a permanent FOMC voting member and
    the Board fills other four spots on a rotating, annual basis, from
    the other 11 districts. The FOMC typically meets every six weeks,
    but it can meet more frequently if necessary. The FOMC tries to act
    by consensus; however, the Federal Reserve's chairman has
    traditionally played a very powerful role in defining and shaping
    that consensus. For the Federal Reserve, and for most central banks,
    open market operations have, over the last few decades, been the
    most commonly used tool of monetary policy.

    <a href="#bookmark1203" class="s34">To understand how open market operations affect the money supply, consider the balance sheet of Happy Bank, displayed in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1203" class="a">Figure</a>
    15.5<a href="#bookmark1203" class="s34">.</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1203" class="a">Figure 15.5</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1203" class="s34">(a) shows that Happy Bank starts with $460 million in assets, divided among reserves, bonds and loans, and $400 million in liabilities in the form of deposits, with a net worth of $60 million. When the central bank purchases $20 million in bonds from Happy Bank, the bond holdings of Happy Bank fall by $20 million and the bank’s reserves rise by $20 million, as</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1203" class="a">Figure 15.5</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1203" class="s34">(b) shows. However, Happy Bank only wants to hold $40 million in reserves (the quantity of reserves with which it started in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1203" class="a">Figure</a>
    15.5<a href="#bookmark1203" class="s34">) (a), so the bank decides to loan out the extra $20 million in reserves and its loans rise by $20 million, as</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1203" class="a">Figure</a>
    15.5<a href="#bookmark1071" class="s34">(c) shows. The central bank's open market operation causes Happy Bank to make loans instead of holding its assets in the form of government bonds, which expands the money supply. As the new loans are deposited in banks throughout the economy, these banks will, in turn, loan out some of the deposits they receive, triggering the money multiplier that we discussed in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1071" class="a">Money and</a> Banking<span
    class="p">.</span>

    <span id="bookmark1203">Figure 15.5</span>

      

    <span id="bookmark1204">Where did the Federal Reserve get the $20
    million that it used to purchase the bonds? A central bank has the
    power to create money. In practical terms, the Federal Reserve would
    write a check to Happy Bank, so that Happy Bank can have that money
    credited to its bank account at the Federal Reserve. In truth, the
    Federal Reserve created the money to purchase the bonds out of thin
    air—or with a few clicks on some computer keys.</span>

    <a href="#bookmark1205" class="s34">Open market operations can also reduce the quantity of money and loans in an economy.</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1205" class="a">Figure 15.6</a> <span
    class="p">(a) shows the balance sheet of Happy Bank before the
    central bank sells bonds in the open market. When Happy Bank
    purchases</span>

    $30 million in bonds, Happy Bank sends $30 million of its reserves
    to the central bank, but now holds an additional

    <a href="#bookmark1205" class="s34">$30 million in bonds, as</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1205" class="a">Figure 15.6</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1205" class="s34">(b) shows. However, Happy Bank wants to hold $40 million in reserves, as in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1205" class="a">Figure 15.6</a> <span
    class="p">(a), so it will adjust down the quantity of its loans by
    $30 million, to bring its reserves back to the</span>

      

      

    <a href="#bookmark1205" class="s34">desired level, as</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1205" class="a">Figure 15.6</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1071" class="s34">(c) shows. In practical terms, a bank can easily reduce its quantity of loans. At any given time, a bank is receiving payments on loans that it made previously and also making new loans. If the bank just slows down or briefly halts making new loans, and instead adds those funds to its reserves, then its overall quantity of loans will decrease. A decrease in the quantity of loans also means fewer deposits in other banks, and other banks reducing their lending as well, as the money multiplier that we discussed in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1071" class="a">Money and Banking</a> <span
    class="p">takes effect. What about all those bonds? How do they
    affect the money supply? Read the following Clear It Up feature for
    the answer.</span>

    Does selling or buying bonds increase the money supply?

    Is it a sale of bonds by the central bank which increases bank
    reserves and lowers interest rates or is it a purchase of bonds by
    the central bank? The easy way to keep track of this is to treat the
    central bank as being *outside* the banking system. When a central
    bank buys bonds, money is flowing from the central bank to
    individual banks in the economy, increasing the money supply in
    circulation. When a central bank sells bonds, then money from
    individual banks in the economy is flowing into the central
    bank—reducing the quantity of money in the economy.

      

    Changing Reserve Requirements

    <span id="bookmark1206">A second method of conducting monetary
    policy is for the central bank to raise or lower the</span>
    **reserve requirement**, which, as we noted earlier, is the
    percentage of each bank’s deposits that it is legally required to
    hold either as cash in their vault or on deposit with the central
    bank. If banks are required to hold a greater amount in reserves,
    they have less money available to lend out. If banks are allowed to
    hold a smaller amount in reserves, they will have a greater amount
    of money available to lend out.<span id="bookmark1207">‌</span>

    In early 2015, the Federal Reserve required banks to hold reserves
    equal to 0% of the first $14.5 million in deposits, then to hold
    reserves equal to 3% of the deposits up to $103.6 million, and 10%
    of any amount above $103.6 million. The Fed makes small changes in
    the reserve requirements almost every year. For example, the $103.6
    million dividing line is sometimes bumped up or down by a few
    million dollars. In practice, the Fed rarely uses large changes in
    reserve requirements to execute monetary policy. A sudden demand
    that all banks increase their reserves would be

      

      

    extremely disruptive and difficult for them to comply, while
    loosening requirements too much would create a danger of banks
    inability to meet withdrawal demands.

    Changing the Discount Rate

    <span id="bookmark1208">The Federal Reserve was founded in the
    aftermath of the 1907 Financial Panic when many banks failed as a
    result of bank runs. As mentioned earlier, since banks make profits
    by lending out their deposits, no bank, even those that are not
    bankrupt, can withstand a bank run. As a result of the Panic, the
    Federal Reserve was founded to be the “lender of last resort.” In
    the event of a bank run, sound banks, (banks that were not bankrupt)
    could borrow as much cash as they needed from the Fed’s discount
    “window” to quell the bank run. We call the interest rate banks pay
    for such loans the</span> **discount rate**. (They are so named
    because the bank makes loans against its outstanding loans “at a
    discount” of their face value.) Once depositors became convinced
    that the bank would be able to honor their withdrawals, they no
    longer had a reason to make a run on the bank. In short, the Federal
    Reserve was originally intended to provide credit passively, but in
    the years since its founding, the Fed has taken on a more active
    role with monetary policy.

    The third traditional method for conducting monetary policy is to
    raise or lower the discount rate. If the central bank raises the
    discount rate, then commercial banks will reduce their borrowing of
    reserves from the Fed, and instead call in loans to replace those
    reserves. Since fewer loans are available, the money supply falls
    and market interest rates rise. If the central bank lowers the
    discount rate it charges to banks, the process works in reverse.

    In recent decades, the Federal Reserve has made relatively few
    discount loans. Before a bank borrows from the Federal Reserve to
    fill out its required reserves, the bank is expected to first borrow
    from other available sources, like other banks. This is encouraged
    by the Fed charging a higher discount rate than the federal funds
    rate. Given that most banks borrow little at the discount rate,
    changing the discount rate up or down has little impact on their
    behavior. More importantly, the Fed has found from experience that
    open market operations are a more precise and powerful means of
    executing any desired monetary policy.

    In the Federal Reserve Act, the phrase “...to afford means of
    rediscounting commercial paper” is contained in its long title. This
    was the main tool for monetary policy when the Fed was initially
    created. This illustrates how monetary policy has evolved and how it
    continues to do so.

    The Effect of Monetary Policy on Interest Rates

    class="s60">2</span>, leading to an equilibrium (E<span
    class="s60">2</span>) with a higher 10% interest rate and a quantity
    of $8 billion in loaned funds.

    of E<span class="s63">1</span>, reducing the interest rate from 8%
    to 6%. A contractionary monetary policy will shift the supply of

    class="s63">0</span>) to the new supply (S<span
    class="s63">2</span>), and raise the interest rate from 8% to 10%.

      

    <a href="#bookmark1212" class="s34">How does a central bank “raise” interest rates? When describing the central bank's monetary policy actions, it is common to hear that the central bank “raised interest rates” or “lowered interest rates.” We need to be clear about this: more precisely, through open market operations the central bank changes bank reserves in a way which affects the supply curve of loanable funds. As a result,</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1212" class="a">Figure 15.7</a> <span
    class="p">shows that interest rates change. If they do not meet the
    Fed’s target, the Fed can supply more or less reserves until
    interest rates do.</span>

    <span id="bookmark1213">Recall that the specific interest rate the
    Fed targets is the</span> **federal funds rate**. The Federal
    Reserve has, since 1995, established its target federal funds rate
    in advance of any open market operations.

    <span id="bookmark1214">Of course, financial markets display a wide
    range of interest rates, representing borrowers with different risk
    premiums and loans that they must repay over different periods of
    time. In general, when the federal funds rate drops substantially,
    other interest rates drop, too, and when the federal funds rate
    rises, other interest rates rise. However, a fall or rise of one
    percentage point in the federal funds rate—which remember is for
    borrowing overnight—will typically have an effect of less than one
    percentage point on a 30-year loan to purchase a house or a
    three-year loan to purchase a car. Monetary policy can push the
    entire spectrum of interest rates higher or lower, but the forces of
    supply and demand in those specific markets for lending and
    borrowing set the specific interest rates.</span>

    The Effect of Monetary Policy on Aggregate Demand

    Monetary policy affects interest rates and the available quantity of
    loanable funds, which in turn affects several components of
    aggregate demand. Tight or contractionary monetary policy that leads
    to higher interest rates and a reduced quantity of loanable funds
    will reduce two components of aggregate demand. Business investment
    will decline because it is less attractive for firms to borrow
    money, and even firms that have money will notice that, with higher
    interest rates, it is relatively more attractive to put those funds
    in a financial investment than to make an investment in physical
    capital. In addition, higher interest rates will discourage consumer
    borrowing for big-ticket items like houses and cars. Conversely,
    loose or expansionary monetary policy that leads to lower interest
    rates and a higher quantity of loanable funds will tend to increase
    business investment and consumer borrowing for big-ticket items.

    <a href="#bookmark1217" id="bookmark1215" class="s34">If the economy is suffering a recession and high unemployment, with output below potential GDP, expansionary monetary policy can help the economy return to potential GDP.</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1217" class="a">Figure</a> <span class="s54">15.8
    </span>(a) illustrates this situation. This example uses a short-run
    upward-sloping Keynesian aggregate supply curve (SRAS). The original
    equilibrium during a recession of E<span class="s60">0</span> occurs
    at an output level of 600. An expansionary monetary policy will
    reduce interest rates and stimulate investment and consumption
    spending, causing the original aggregate demand curve (AD<span
    class="s60">0</span>) to shift right to AD<span
    class="s60">1</span>, so that the new equilibrium (E<span
    class="s60">1</span>) occurs at the potential GDP level of 700.<span

    will reduce interest rates and shift aggregate demand to the right

    leading to the new equilibrium (E<span class="s63">1</span>) at the

    potential GDP level of output at the equilibrium E<span

    left from AD<span class="s63">0</span> to AD<span
    class="s63">1</span>, thus leading to a new equilibrium (E<span

    <a href="#bookmark1217" class="s34">Conversely, if an economy is producing at a quantity of output above its potential GDP, a contractionary monetary policy can reduce the inflationary pressures for a rising price level. In</a>

    **countercyclical**<a href="#bookmark1219" class="s34">; that is, it should act to counterbalance the business cycles of economic downturns and upswings. The Fed should loosen monetary policy when a recession has caused unemployment to increase and tighten it when inflation threatens. Of course, countercyclical policy does pose a danger of overreaction. If loose monetary policy seeking to end a recession goes too far, it may push aggregate demand so far to the right that it triggers inflation. If tight monetary policy seeking to reduce inflation goes too far, it may push aggregate demand so far to the left that a recession begins.</a>

    Federal Reserve Actions Over Last Four Decades

    For the period from the mid-1970s up through the end of 2007, we can
    summarize Federal Reserve monetary policy by looking at how it
    targeted the federal funds interest rate using open market
    operations.

    Of course, telling the story of the U.S. economy since 1975 in terms
    of Federal Reserve actions leaves out many other macroeconomic
    factors that were influencing unemployment, recession, economic
    growth, and inflation over this time. The nine episodes of Federal
    Reserve action outlined in the sections below also demonstrate that
    we should consider the central bank as one of the leading actors
    influencing the macro economy. As we noted earlier, the single
    person with the greatest power to influence the U.S. economy is
    probably the Federal Reserve chairperson.

    <a href="#bookmark1221" id="bookmark1220" class="a">Figure 15.10</a>
    <span class="p">shows how the Federal Reserve has carried out
    monetary policy by targeting the federal funds interest rate in the
    last few decades. The graph shows the federal funds interest rate
    (remember, this interest rate is set through open market
    operations), the unemployment rate, and the inflation rate
    since 1975. Different episodes of monetary policy during this period
    are indicated in the figure.</span>

      

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_327.jpg" width="461" height="256" alt="image" />

    <span id="bookmark1221">Figure 15.10 Monetary Policy, Unemployment,
    and Inflation</span> <span class="s37">Through the episodes here,
    the Federal Reserve typically reacted to higher inflation with a
    contractionary monetary policy and a higher interest rate, and
    reacted to higher unemployment with an expansionary monetary policy
    and a lower interest rate.</span>

      

    Episode 1

    Consider Episode 1 in the late 1970s. The rate of inflation was very
    high, exceeding 10% in 1979 and 1980, so the Federal Reserve used
    tight monetary policy to raise interest rates, with the federal
    funds rate rising from 5.5% in 1977 to 16.4% in 1981. By 1983,
    inflation was down to 3.2%, but aggregate demand contracted sharply
    enough that back- to-back recessions occurred in 1980 and in
    1981–1982, and the unemployment rate rose from 5.8% in 1979 to 9.7%
    in 1982.

    Episode 2

    In Episode 2, when economists persuaded the Federal Reserve in the
    early 1980s that inflation was declining, the Fed began slashing
    interest rates to reduce unemployment. The federal funds interest
    rate fell from 16.4% in 1981 to 6.8% in 1986. By 1986 or so,
    inflation had fallen to about 2% and the unemployment rate had come
    down to 7%, and was still falling.

    Episode 3

    However, in Episode 3 in the late 1980s, inflation appeared to be
    creeping up again, rising from 2% in 1986 up toward 5% by 1989. In
    response, the Federal Reserve used contractionary monetary policy to
    raise the federal funds rates from 6.6% in 1987 to 9.2% in 1989. The
    tighter monetary policy stopped inflation, which fell from above 5%
    in 1990 to under 3% in 1992, but it also helped to cause the
    1990-1991 recession, and the unemployment rate rose from 5.3% in
    1989 to 7.5% by 1992.

    Episode 4

      

      

    In Episode 4, in the early 1990s, when the Federal Reserve was
    confident that inflation was back under control, it reduced interest
    rates, with the federal funds interest rate falling from 8.1% in
    1990 to 3.5% in 1992. As the economy expanded, the unemployment rate
    declined from 7.5% in 1992 to less than 5% by 1997.

    Episodes 5 and 6

    In Episodes 5 and 6, the Federal Reserve perceived a risk of
    inflation and raised the federal funds rate from 3% to 5.8% from
    1993 to 1995. Inflation did not rise, and the period of economic
    growth during the 1990s continued. Then in 1999 and 2000, the Fed
    was concerned that inflation seemed to be creeping up so it raised
    the federal funds interest rate from 4.6% in December 1998 to 6.5%
    in June 2000. By early 2001, inflation was declining again, but a
    recession occurred in 2001. Between 2000 and 2002, the unemployment
    rate rose from 4.0% to 5.8%.

    Episodes 7 and 8

    In Episodes 7 and 8, the Federal Reserve conducted a loose monetary
    policy and slashed the federal funds rate from 6.2% in 2000 to just
    1.7% in 2002, and then again to 1% in 2003. They actually did this
    because of fear of Japan-style deflation. This persuaded them to
    lower the Fed funds further than they otherwise would have. The
    recession ended, but, unemployment rates were slow to decline in the
    early 2000s. Finally, in 2004, the unemployment rate declined and
    the Federal Reserve began to raise the federal funds rate until it
    reached 5% by 2007.

    Episode 9

    In Episode 9, as the Great Recession took hold in 2008, the Federal
    Reserve was quick to slash interest rates, taking them down to 2% in
    2008 and to nearly 0% in 2009. When the Fed had taken interest rates
    down to near-zero by December 2008, the economy was still deep in
    recession. Open market operations could not make the interest rate
    turn negative. The Federal Reserve had to think “outside the box.”

    Quantitative Easing

    <span id="bookmark1222">The most powerful and commonly used of the
    three traditional tools of monetary policy—open market
    operations—works by expanding or contracting the money supply in a
    way that influences the interest rate. In late 2008, as the U.S.
    economy struggled with recession, the Federal Reserve had already
    reduced the interest rate to near- zero. With the recession still
    ongoing, the Fed decided to adopt an innovative and nontraditional
    policy known as</span> **quantitative easing (QE)**. This is the
    purchase of long-term government and private mortgage-backed
    securities by central banks to make credit available so as to
    stimulate aggregate demand.<span id="bookmark1223">‌</span>

    <span id="bookmark1224">Quantitative easing differed from
    traditional monetary policy in several key ways. First, it involved
    the Fed purchasing long term Treasury bonds, rather than short term
    Treasury bills. In 2008, however, it was impossible to stimulate the
    economy any further by lowering short term rates because they were
    already as low as they could get. (Read the closing Bring it Home
    feature for more on this.) Therefore, Chairman Bernanke sought to
    lower long-term rates utilizing quantitative easing.</span>

    This leads to a second way QE is different from traditional monetary
    policy. Instead of purchasing Treasury securities, the Fed also
    began purchasing private mortgage-backed securities, something it
    had never done before. During the financial crisis, which
    precipitated the recession, mortgage-backed securities were termed
    “toxic assets,” because when the housing market collapsed, no one
    knew what these securities were worth, which put the financial
    institutions which were holding those securities on very shaky
    ground. By offering to purchase mortgage-backed securities, the Fed
    was both pushing long term interest rates down and also removing
    possibly “toxic assets” from the balance sheets of private financial
    firms, which would strengthen the financial system.

    Quantitative easing (QE) occurred in three episodes:

    1.  During QE<span class="s60">1</span>, which began in November
        2008, the Fed purchased $600 billion in mortgage-backed
        securities from government enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie
        Mac.

    2.  In November 2010, the Fed began QE<span class="s60">2</span>, in
        which it purchased $600 billion in U.S. Treasury bonds.

    3.  QE<span class="s60">3</span>, began in September 2012 when the
        Fed commenced purchasing $40 billion of additional mortgage-
        backed securities per month. This amount was increased in
        December 2012 to $85 billion per month. The Fed stated that,
        when economic conditions permit, it will begin tapering (or
        reducing the monthly purchases). By October 2014, the Fed had
        announced the final $15 billion bond purchase, ending
        Quantitative Easing.

        We usually think of the quantitative easing policies that the
        Federal Reserve adopted (as did other central banks around the
        world) as temporary emergency measures. If these steps are to be
        temporary, then the Federal Reserve will

          

          

        need to stop making these additional loans and sell off the
        financial securities it has accumulated. The concern is that the
        process of quantitative easing may prove more difficult to
        reverse than it was to enact. The evidence suggests that QE<span
        class="s60">1</span> was somewhat successful, but that QE<span
        class="s60">2</span> and QE<span class="s60">3</span> have been
        less so.

    id="bookmark1225">‌</span>

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Analyze whether monetary policy decisions should be made more
        democratically

    -   Calculate the velocity of money

    -   Evaluate the central bank’s influence on inflation,
        unemployment, asset bubbles, and leverage cycles

    -   Calculate the effects of monetary stimulus

      

    <span id="bookmark1226">In the real world, effective monetary policy
    faces a number of significant hurdles. Monetary policy affects the
    economy only after a time lag that is typically long and of variable
    length. Remember, monetary policy involves a chain of events: the
    central bank must perceive a situation in the economy, hold a
    meeting, and make a decision to react by tightening or loosening
    monetary policy. The change in monetary policy must percolate
    through the banking system, changing the quantity of loans and
    affecting interest rates. When interest rates change, businesses
    must change their investment levels and consumers must change their
    borrowing patterns when purchasing homes or cars. Then it takes time
    for these changes to filter through the rest of the economy.</span>

    As a result of this chain of events, monetary policy has little
    effect in the immediate future. Instead, its primary effects are
    felt perhaps one to three years in the future. The reality of long
    and variable time lags does not mean that a central bank should
    refuse to make decisions. It does mean that central banks should be
    humble about taking action, because of the risk that their actions
    can create as much or more economic instability as they resolve.

    Excess Reserves

    <span id="bookmark1227">Banks are legally required to hold a minimum
    level of reserves, but no rule prohibits them from holding
    additional</span> **excess reserves** above the legally mandated
    limit. For example, during a recession banks may be hesitant to
    lend, because they fear that when the economy is contracting, a high
    proportion of loan applicants become less likely to repay their
    loans.

    <span id="bookmark1228">When many banks are choosing to hold excess
    reserves, expansionary monetary policy may not work well. This may
    occur because the banks are concerned about a deteriorating economy,
    while the central bank is trying to expand the money supply. If the
    banks prefer to hold excess reserves above the legally required
    level, the central bank cannot force individual banks to make loans.
    Similarly, sensible businesses and consumers may be reluctant to
    borrow substantial amounts of money in a recession, because they
    recognize that firms’ sales and employees’ jobs are more insecure in
    a recession, and they do not want to face the need to make interest
    payments. The result is that during an especially deep recession, an
    expansionary monetary policy may have little effect on either the
    price level or the real GDP.</span><span id="bookmark1229">‌</span>

    Japan experienced this situation in the 1990s and early 2000s.
    Japan’s economy entered a period of very slow growth, dipping in and
    out of recession, in the early 1990s. By February 1999, the Bank of
    Japan had lowered the equivalent of its federal funds rate to 0%. It
    kept it there most of the time through 2003. Moreover, in the two
    years from March 2001 to March 2003, the Bank of Japan also expanded
    the country's money supply by about 50%—an enormous increase. Even
    this highly expansionary monetary policy, however, had no
    substantial effect on stimulating aggregate demand. Japan’s economy
    continued to experience extremely slow growth into the mid-2000s.

      

    Should monetary policy decisions be made more democratically?

    Should a nation’s Congress or legislature comprised of elected
    representatives conduct monetary policy or should a politically
    appointed central bank that is more independent of voters take
    charge? Here are some of

      

    the arguments.

    The Case for Greater Democratic Control of Monetary Policy

    Elected representatives pass taxes and spending bills to conduct
    fiscal policy by passing tax and spending bills. They could handle
    monetary policy in the same way. They will sometimes make mistakes,
    but in a democracy, it is better to have elected officials who are
    accountable to voters make mistakes instead of political appointees.
    After all, the people appointed to the top governing positions at
    the Federal Reserve—and to most central banks around the world—are
    typically bankers and economists. They are not representatives of
    borrowers like small businesses or farmers nor are they
    representatives of labor unions. Central banks might not be so quick
    to raise interest rates if they had to pay more attention to firms
    and people in the real economy.

    The Case for an Independent Central Bank

    Because the central bank has some insulation from day-to-day
    politics, its members can take a nonpartisan look at specific
    economic situations and make tough, immediate decisions when
    necessary. The idea of giving a legislature the ability to create
    money and hand out loans is likely to end up badly, sooner or later.
    It is simply too tempting for lawmakers to expand the money supply
    to fund their projects. The long term result will be rampant
    inflation. Also, a central bank, acting according to the laws passed
    by elected officials, can respond far more quickly than a
    legislature. For example, the U.S. budget takes months to debate,
    pass, and sign into law, but monetary policy decisions happen much
    more rapidly. Day-to-day democratic control of monetary policy is
    impractical and seems likely to lead to an overly expansionary
    monetary policy and higher inflation.

      

    The problem of excess reserves does not affect contractionary
    policy. Central bankers have an old saying that monetary policy can
    be like pulling and pushing on a string: when the central bank pulls
    on the string and uses contractionary monetary policy, it can
    definitely raise interest rates and reduce aggregate demand.
    However, when the central bank tries to push on the string of
    expansionary monetary policy, the string may sometimes just fold up
    limp and have little effect, because banks decide not to loan out
    their excess reserves. Do not take this analogy too
    literally—expansionary monetary policy usually does have real
    effects, after that inconveniently long and variable lag. There are
    also times, like Japan’s economy in the late 1990s and early 2000s,
    when expansionary monetary policy has been insufficient to lift a
    recession-prone economy.

    Unpredictable Movements of Velocity

    Velocity is a term that economists use to describe how quickly money
    circulates through the economy. We define the

    <span id="bookmark1230">velocity</span> <span class="p">of money in
    a year as:</span>

    Velocity =

    nominal GDP<span class="s16"> money supply</span>

    <span id="bookmark1231">Specific measurements of velocity depend on
    the definition of the money supply used. Consider the velocity of
    M1, the total amount of currency in circulation and checking account
    balances. In 2009, for example, M1 was $1.7 trillion and nominal GDP
    was $14.3 trillion, so the velocity of M1 was 8.4 ($14.3
    trillion/$1.7 trillion). A higher velocity of money means that the
    average dollar circulates more times in a year. A lower velocity
    means that the average dollar circulates fewer times in a
    year.</span>

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_329.png" width="624" height="51" alt="image" />

    What happens during episodes of deflation?

    <span id="bookmark1232">Deflation occurs when the rate of inflation
    is negative; that is, instead of money having less purchasing power
    over time, as occurs with inflation, money is worth more. Deflation
    can make it very difficult for monetary policy to address a
    recession.</span>

    <span id="bookmark1233">Remember that the real interest rate is the
    nominal interest rate minus the rate of inflation. If the
    nominal</span>

    See the following Clear It Up feature for a discussion of how
    deflation could affect monetary policy.

      

      

    interest rate is 7% and the rate of inflation is 3%, then the
    borrower is effectively paying a 4% real interest rate. If the
    nominal interest rate is 7% and there is *deflation* of 2%, then the
    real interest rate is actually 9%. In this way, an unexpected
    deflation raises the real interest payments for borrowers. It can
    lead to a situation where borrowers do not repay an unexpectedly
    high number of loans, and banks find that their net worth is
    decreasing or negative. When banks are suffering losses, they become
    less able and eager to make new loans. Aggregate demand declines,
    which can lead to recession.

    Then the double-whammy: After causing a recession, deflation can
    make it difficult for monetary policy to work. Say that the central
    bank uses expansionary monetary policy to reduce the nominal
    interest rate all the way to zero—but the economy has 5% deflation.
    As a result, the real interest rate is 5%, and because a central
    bank cannot make the nominal interest rate negative, expansionary
    policy cannot reduce the real interest rate further.

    In the U.S. economy during the early 1930s, deflation was 6.7% per
    year from 1930–1933, which caused many borrowers to default on their
    loans and many banks to end up bankrupt, which in turn contributed
    substantially to the Great Depression. Not all episodes of
    deflation, however, end in economic depression. Japan, for example,
    experienced deflation of slightly less than 1% per year from
    1999–2002, which hurt the Japanese economy, but it still grew by
    about 0.9% per year over this period. There is at least one
    historical example of deflation coexisting with rapid growth. The
    U.S. economy experienced deflation of about 1.1% per year over the
    quarter-century from 1876–1900, but real GDP also expanded at a
    rapid clip of 4% per year over this time, despite some occasional
    severe recessions.

    The central bank should be on guard against deflation and, if
    necessary, use expansionary monetary policy to prevent any
    long-lasting or extreme deflation from occurring. Except in severe
    cases like the Great Depression, deflation does not guarantee
    economic disaster.

      

    Changes in velocity can cause problems for monetary policy. To
    understand why, rewrite the definition of velocity so that the money
    supply is on the left-hand side of the equation. That is:

    Money supply × velocity = Nominal GDP

    <a href="#bookmark432" class="s34">Recall from</a>
    <a href="#bookmark432" class="a">The Macroeconomic Perspective</a>
    <span class="p">that</span>

    Nominal GDP = Price Level (or GDP Deflator) × Real GDP.

    Therefore,

      

    Money Supply × velocity = Nominal GDP = Price Level × Real GDP.

    <span id="bookmark1234">We sometimes call this equation the</span>
    **basic quantity equation of money** but, as you can see, it is just
    the definition of velocity written in a different form. This
    equation must hold true, by definition.

    <span id="bookmark1235">If velocity is constant over time, then a
    certain percentage rise in the money supply on the left-hand side of
    the basic quantity equation of money will inevitably lead to the
    same percentage rise in nominal GDP—although this change could
    happen through an increase in inflation, or an increase in real GDP,
    or some combination of the two. If velocity is changing over time
    but in a constant and predictable way, then changes in the money
    supply will continue to have a predictable effect on nominal GDP. If
    velocity changes unpredictably over time, however, then the effect
    of changes in the money supply on nominal GDP becomes
    unpredictable.</span><span id="bookmark1236">‌</span>

    <a href="#bookmark1238" id="bookmark1237" class="a">Figure 15.11</a>
    <span class="p">illustrates the actual velocity of money in the U.S.
    economy as measured by using M1, the most common definition of the
    money supply. From 1960 up to about 1980, velocity appears fairly
    predictable; that is, it is increasing at a fairly constant rate. In
    the early 1980s, however, velocity as calculated with M1 becomes
    more variable. The reasons for these sharp changes in velocity
    remain a puzzle. Economists suspect that the changes in velocity are
    related to innovations in banking and finance which have changed how
    we are using money in making economic transactions: for example, the
    growth of electronic payments; a rise in personal borrowing and
    credit card usage; and accounts that make it easier for people to
    hold money in savings accounts, where it is counted as M2, right up
    to the moment that they want to write a check on the money and
    transfer it to M1. So far at least, it has proven difficult to draw
    clear links between these kinds of factors and the specific
    up-and-down fluctuations in M1. Given many changes in banking and
    the prevalence of electronic banking, economists now favor M2 as a
    measure of money rather than the narrower M1.</span>

      

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_330.jpg" width="471" height="222" alt="image" />

    <span id="bookmark1238">Figure 15.11 Velocity Calculated Using
    M1</span> <span class="s37">Velocity is the nominal GDP divided by
    the money supply for a given year. We can calculate different
    measures of velocity by using different measures of the money
    supply. Velocity, as calculated by using M1, has lacked a steady
    trend since the 1980s, instead bouncing up and down. (credit:
    Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis)</span>

      

    <span id="bookmark1239">In the 1970s, when velocity as measured by
    M1 seemed predictable, a number of economists, led by Nobel laureate
    Milton Friedman (1912–2006), argued that the best monetary policy
    was for the central bank to increase the money supply at a constant
    growth rate. These economists argued that with the long and variable
    lags of monetary policy, and the political pressures on central
    bankers, central bank monetary policies were as likely to have
    undesirable as to have desirable effects. Thus, these economists
    believed that the monetary policy should seek steady growth in the
    money supply of 3% per year. They argued that a steady monetary
    growth rate would be correct over longer time periods, since it
    would roughly match the growth of the real economy. In addition,
    they argued that giving the central bank less discretion to conduct
    monetary policy would prevent an overly activist central bank from
    becoming a source of economic instability and uncertainty. In this
    spirit, Friedman wrote in 1967: “The first and most important lesson
    that history teaches about what monetary policy can do—and it is a
    lesson of the most profound importance—is that monetary policy can
    prevent money itself from being a major source of economic
    disturbance.”</span>

    As the velocity of M1 began to fluctuate in the 1980s, having the
    money supply grow at a predetermined and unchanging rate seemed less
    desirable, because as the quantity theory of money shows, the
    combination of constant growth in the money supply and fluctuating
    velocity would cause nominal GDP to rise and fall in unpredictable
    ways. The jumpiness of velocity in the 1980s caused many central
    banks to focus less on the rate at which the quantity of money in
    the economy was increasing, and instead to set monetary policy by
    reacting to whether the economy was experiencing or in danger of
    higher inflation or unemployment.

    Unemployment and Inflation

    <a href="#bookmark1242" id="bookmark1240" class="s34">If you were to survey central bankers around the world and ask them what they believe should be the primary task of monetary policy, the most popular answer by far would be fighting inflation. Most central bankers believe that the neoclassical model of economics accurately represents the economy over the medium to long term. Remember that in the neoclassical model of the economy, we draw the aggregate supply curve as a vertical line at the level of potential GDP, as</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1242" class="a">Figure 15.12</a><span class="s54">
    </span>shows. In the neoclassical model, economists determine the
    level of potential GDP (and the natural rate of unemployment that
    exists when the economy is producing at potential GDP) by real
    economic factors. If the original level of aggregate demand is
    AD<span class="s60">0</span>, then an expansionary monetary policy
    that shifts aggregate demand to AD<span class="s60">1</span> only
    creates an inflationary increase in the price level, but it does not
    alter GDP or unemployment. From this perspective, all that monetary
    policy can do is to lead to low inflation or high inflation—and low
    inflation provides a better climate for a healthy and growing
    economy. After all, low inflation means that businesses making
    investments can focus on real economic issues, not on figuring out
    ways to protect themselves from the costs and risks of inflation. In
    this way, a consistent pattern of low inflation can contribute to
    long-term growth.<span id="bookmark1241">‌</span>

      

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_331.jpg" width="237" height="198" alt="image" />

    <span id="bookmark1242"><span class="s36">Figure 15.12 Monetary
    Policy in a Neoclassical Model </span></span>In a neoclassical view,
    monetary policy affects only the price level, not the level of
    output in the economy. For example, an expansionary monetary policy
    causes aggregate demand to shift from the original AD<span
    class="s63">0</span> to AD<span class="s63">1</span>. However, the
    adjustment of the economy from the original equilibrium (E<span
    class="s63">0</span>) to the new equilibrium (E<span
    class="s63">1</span>) represents an inflationary increase in the
    price level from P<span class="s63">0</span> to P<span
    class="s63">1</span>, but has no effect in the long run on output or
    the unemployment rate. In fact, no shift in AD will affect the
    equilibrium quantity of output in this model.

      

    <span id="bookmark1243">This vision of focusing monetary policy on a
    low rate of inflation is so attractive that many countries have
    rewritten their central banking laws since in the 1990s to have
    their bank practice</span> **inflation targeting**, which means that
    the central bank is legally required to focus primarily on keeping
    inflation low. By 2014, central banks in 28 countries, including
    Austria, Brazil, Canada, Israel, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Spain,
    Sweden, Thailand, and the United Kingdom faced a legal requirement
    to target the inflation rate. A notable exception is the Federal
    Reserve in the United States, which does not practice
    inflation-targeting. Instead, the law governing the Federal Reserve
    requires it to take both unemployment and inflation into
    account.<span id="bookmark1244">‌</span>

    <span id="bookmark1245">Economists have no final consensus on
    whether a central bank should be required to focus only on inflation
    or should have greater discretion. For those who subscribe to the
    inflation targeting philosophy, the fear is that politicians who are
    worried about slow economic growth and unemployment will constantly
    pressure the central bank to conduct a loose monetary policy—even if
    the economy is already producing at potential GDP. In some
    countries, the central bank may lack the political power to resist
    such pressures, with the result of higher inflation, but no
    long-term reduction in unemployment. The U.S. Federal Reserve has a
    tradition of independence, but central banks in other countries may
    be under greater political pressure. For all of these reasons—long
    and variable lags, excess reserves, unstable velocity, and
    controversy over economic goals—monetary policy in the real world is
    often difficult. The basic message remains, however, that central
    banks can affect aggregate demand through the conduct of monetary
    policy and in that way influence macroeconomic outcomes.</span>

    Asset Bubbles and Leverage Cycles

    <span id="bookmark1246">One long-standing concern about having the
    central bank focus on inflation and unemployment is that it may be
    overlooking certain other economic problems that are coming in the
    future. For example, from 1994 to 2000 during what was known as the
    “dot-com” boom, the U.S. stock market, which the Dow Jones
    Industrial Index measures (which includes 30 very large companies
    from across the U.S. economy), nearly tripled in value. The Nasdaq
    index, which includes many smaller technology companies, increased
    in value by a multiple of five from 1994 to 2000. These rates of
    increase were clearly not sustainable. Stock values as measured by
    the Dow Jones were almost 20% lower in 2009 than they had been
    in 2000. Stock values in the Nasdaq index were 50% lower in 2009
    than they had been in 2000. The drop-off in stock market values
    contributed to the 2001 recession and the higher unemployment that
    followed.</span><span id="bookmark1247">‌</span>

    We can tell a similar story about housing prices in the mid-2000s.
    During the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, housing prices increased at
    about 6% per year on average. During what came to be known as the
    “housing bubble” from 2003 to 2005, housing prices increased at
    almost double this annual rate. These rates of increase were clearly
    not sustainable. When housing prices fell in 2007 and 2008, many
    banks and households found that their assets were worth less than
    they expected, which contributed to the recession that started
    in 2007.

    <span id="bookmark1248">At a broader level, some economists worry
    about a leverage cycle, where “leverage” is a term financial
    economists</span>

      

      

    <span id="bookmark1249">use to mean “borrowing.” When economic times
    are good, banks and the financial sector are eager to lend, and
    people and firms are eager to borrow. Remember that a money
    multiplier determines the amount of money and credit in an economy
    —a process of loans made, money deposited, and more loans made. In
    good economic times, this surge of lending exaggerates the episode
    of economic growth. It can even be part of what lead prices of
    certain assets—like stock prices or housing prices—to rise at
    unsustainably high annual rates. At some point, when economic times
    turn bad, banks and the financial sector become much less willing to
    lend, and credit becomes expensive or unavailable to many potential
    borrowers. The sharp reduction in credit, perhaps combined with the
    deflating prices of a dot-com stock price bubble or a housing
    bubble, makes the economic downturn worse than it would otherwise
    be.</span>

    Thus, some economists have suggested that the central bank should
    not just look at economic growth, inflation, and unemployment rates,
    but should also keep an eye on asset prices and leverage cycles.
    Such proposals are quite controversial. If a central bank had
    announced in 1997 that stock prices were rising “too fast” or in
    2004 that housing prices were rising “too fast,” and then taken
    action to hold down price increases, many people and their elected
    political representatives would have been outraged. Neither the
    Federal Reserve nor any other central banks want to take the
    responsibility of deciding when stock prices and housing prices are
    too high, too low, or just right. As further research explores how
    asset price bubbles and leverage cycles can affect an economy,
    central banks may need to think about whether they should conduct
    monetary policy in a way that would seek to moderate these effects.

    Calculating the Effects of Monetary Stimulus

    Suppose that the central bank wants to stimulate the economy by
    increasing the money supply. The bankers estimate that the velocity
    of money is 3, and that the price level will increase from 100 to
    110 due to the stimulus. Using the quantity equation of money, what
    will be the impact of an $800 billion dollar increase in the money
    supply on the quantity of goods and services in the economy given an
    initial money supply of $4 trillion?

    Step 1. We begin by writing the quantity equation of money: MV = PQ.
    We know that initially V = 3, M = 4,000 (billion) and P = 100.
    Substituting these numbers in, we can solve for Q:

    MV = PQ 4,000 × 3 = 100 × Q

    Q = 120

    Step 2. Now we want to find the effect of the addition $800 billion
    in the money supply, together with the increase in the price level.
    The new equation is:

    MV = PQ 4,800 × 3 = 110 × Q

    Q = 130.9

    Step 3. If we take the difference between the two quantities, we
    find that the monetary stimulus increased the quantity of goods and
    services in the economy by 10.9 billion.

    Let’s end this chapter with a Work it Out exercise in how the Fed—or
    any central bank—would stir up the economy by increasing the money
    supply.

    The Problem of the Zero Percent Interest Rate Lower Bound

    In 2008, the U.S. Federal Reserve found itself in a difficult
    position. The federal funds rate was on its way to near zero, which
    meant that traditional open market operations, by which the Fed
    purchases U.S. Treasury Bills to lower short term interest rates,
    was no longer viable. This so called “zero bound problem,” prompted
    the Fed, under then Chair Ben Bernanke, to attempt some
    unconventional policies, collectively called quantitative easing. By
    early 2014, quantitative easing nearly quintupled the amount of bank
    reserves. This likely contributed to the U.S. economy’s recovery,
    but the impact was muted, probably due to some of the hurdles
    mentioned in the last section of this module. The unprecedented
    increase in bank reserves also led to fears of inflation. As of
    early 2015, however, there have been no serious signs of a boom,
    with core inflation around a stable 1.7%.

    KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY

      

    1.  <a href="#bookmark1178" class="a">The Federal Reserve Banking System and Central</a>
        [Banks](#bookmark1178)

        The most prominent task of a central bank is to conduct monetary
        policy, which involves changes to interest rates and credit
        conditions, affecting the amount of borrowing and spending in an
        economy. Some prominent central banks around the world include
        the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of
        Japan, and the Bank of England.

          

    2.  <a href="#bookmark1187" class="a">Bank</a>
        [Regulation](#bookmark1187)

        A bank run occurs when there are rumors (possibly true, possibly
        false) that a bank is at financial risk of having negative net
        worth. As a result, depositors rush to the bank to withdraw
        their money and put it someplace safer. Even false rumors, if
        they cause a bank run, can force a healthy bank to lose its
        deposits and be forced to close. Deposit insurance guarantees
        bank depositors that, even if the bank has negative net worth,
        their deposits will be protected. In

          

          

        the United States, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
        (FDIC) collects deposit insurance premiums from banks and
        guarantees bank deposits up to $250,000. Bank supervision
        involves inspecting the balance sheets of banks to make sure
        that they have positive net worth and that their assets are not
        too risky. In the United States, the Office of the Comptroller
        of the Currency (OCC) is responsible for supervising banks and
        inspecting savings and loans and the National Credit Union
        Administration (NCUA) is responsible for inspecting credit
        unions. The FDIC and the Federal Reserve also play a role in
        bank supervision.

        When a central bank acts as a lender of last resort, it makes
        short-term loans available in situations of severe financial
        panic or stress. The failure of a single bank can be treated
        like any other business failure. Yet if many banks fail, it can
        reduce aggregate demand in a way that can bring on or deepen a
        recession. The combination of deposit insurance, bank
        supervision, and lender of last resort policies help to prevent
        weaknesses in the banking system from causing recessions.

          

    3.  <a href="#bookmark1199" class="a">How a Central Bank Executes Monetary</a>
        [Policy](#bookmark1199)

        A central bank has three traditional tools to conduct monetary
        policy: open market operations, which involves buying and
        selling government bonds with banks; reserve requirements, which
        determine what level of reserves a bank is legally required to
        hold; and discount rates, which is the interest rate charged by
        the central bank on the loans that it gives to other commercial
        banks. The most commonly used tool is open market operations.

          

    4.  <a href="#bookmark1209" class="a">Monetary Policy and Economic</a>
        [Outcomes](#bookmark1209)

        An expansionary (or loose) monetary policy raises the quantity
        of money and credit above what it otherwise would have been and
        reduces interest rates, boosting aggregate demand, and thus
        countering recession. A contractionary monetary policy, also
        called a tight monetary policy, reduces the quantity of money
        and credit below what it otherwise would have been and raises
        interest rates, seeking to hold down inflation. During the
        2008–2009 recession, central banks around the world also used
        quantitative easing to expand the supply of credit.

          

    5.  <a href="#bookmark1225" class="a">Pitfalls for Monetary</a>
        [Policy](#bookmark1225)

Monetary policy is inevitably imprecise, for a number of reasons: (a)
the effects occur only after long and variable lags; (b) if banks decide
to hold excess reserves, monetary policy cannot force them to lend; and
(c) velocity may shift in unpredictable ways. The basic quantity
equation of money is MV = PQ, where M is the money supply, V is the
velocity of money, P is the price level, and Q is the real output of the
economy. Some central banks, like the European Central Bank, practice
inflation targeting, which means that the only goal of the central bank
is to keep inflation within a low target range. Other central banks,
such as the U.S. Federal Reserve, are free to focus on either reducing
inflation or stimulating an economy that is in recession, whichever goal
seems most important at the time.

    PROBLEMS

      

4.  Suppose the Fed conducts an open market purchase by buying $10
    million in Treasury bonds from Acme Bank. Sketch out the balance
    sheet changes that will occur as Acme converts the bond sale
    proceeds to new loans. The initial Acme bank balance sheet contains
    the following information: Assets – reserves 30, bonds 50, and loans

Is a Stronger Dollar Good for the U.S. Economy?

From 2002 to 2008, the U.S. dollar lost more than a quarter of its value
in foreign currency markets. On January 1, 2002, one dollar was worth
1.11 euros. On April 24, 2008 it hit its lowest point with a dollar
being worth 0.64 euros. During this period, the trade deficit between
the United States and the European Union grew from a yearly total of
approximately –85.7 billion dollars in 2002 to 95.8 billion dollars in
2008. Was this a good thing or a bad thing for the U.S. economy?

We live in a global world. U.S. consumers buy trillions of dollars worth
of imported goods and services each year, not just from the European
Union, but from all over the world. U.S. businesses sell trillions of
dollars’ worth of exports. U.S. citizens, businesses, and governments
invest trillions of dollars abroad every year. Foreign investors,
businesses, and governments invest trillions of dollars in the United
States each year. Indeed, foreigners are a major buyer of U.S. federal
debt.

Many people feel that a weaker dollar is bad for America, that it’s an
indication of a weak economy, but is it? This chapter will help answer
that question.

  

#### Introduction to Exchange Rates and International Capital

  

#### Flows

In this chapter, you will learn about:

-   How the Foreign Exchange Market Works

-   Demand and Supply Shifts in Foreign Exchange Markets

-   Macroeconomic Effects of Exchange Rates

-   Exchange Rate Policies

  

The world has over 150 different currencies, from the Afghanistan
afghani and the Albanian lek all the way through the alphabet to the
Zambian kwacha and the Zimbabwean dollar. For international economic
transactions, households or firms will wish to exchange one currency for
another. Perhaps the need for exchanging currencies will come from a
German firm that exports products to Russia, but then wishes to exchange
the Russian rubles it has earned for euros, so that the firm can pay its
workers and suppliers in Germany. Perhaps it will be a South African
firm that wishes to purchase a mining operation in Angola, but to make
the purchase it must convert South African rand to Angolan kwanza.
Perhaps it will be an American tourist visiting China, who wishes to
convert U.S. dollars to Chinese yuan to pay the hotel bill.

Exchange rates can sometimes change very swiftly. For example, in the
United Kingdom the pound was worth about

$1.50 just before the nation voted to leave the European Union (also
known as the Brexit vote), but fell to $1.37 just after the vote and
continued falling to reach 30-year lows a few months later. For firms
engaged in international buying, selling, lending, and borrowing, these
swings in exchange rates can have an enormous effect on profits.

<span id="bookmark1286">This chapter discusses the international
dimension of money, which involves conversions from one currency to
another at an exchange rate. An exchange rate is nothing more than a
price—that is, the price of one currency in terms of another
currency—and so we can analyze it with the tools of supply and demand.
The first module of this chapter begins with an overview of foreign
exchange markets: their size, their main participants, and the
vocabulary for discussing movements of exchange rates. The following
module uses demand and supply graphs to analyze some of the main factors
that cause shifts in exchange rates. A final module then brings the
central bank and monetary policy back into the picture. Each country
must decide whether to allow the market to determine its exchange rate,
or have the central bank intervene. All the choices for exchange rate
policy involve distinctive tradeoffs and risks.</span><span

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Define "foreign exchange market"

    -   Describe different types of investments like foreign direct
        investments (FDI), portfolio investments, and hedging

    -   Explain how appreciating or depreciating currency affects
        exchange rates

    -   Identify who benefits from a stronger currency and benefits from
        a weaker currency

      

    <span id="bookmark1289">Most countries have different currencies,
    but not all. Sometimes small economies use an economically larger
    neighbor's currency. For example, Ecuador, El Salvador, and Panama
    have decided to</span> **dollarize**—that is, to use the

    <span id="bookmark1290">U.S. dollar as their currency. Sometimes
    nations share a common currency. A large-scale example of a common
    currency is the decision by 17 European nations—including some very
    large economies such as France, Germany, and Italy—to replace their
    former currencies with the euro. With these exceptions, most of the
    international economy takes place in a situation of multiple
    national currencies in which both people and firms need to convert
    from one currency to another when selling, buying, hiring,
    borrowing, traveling, or investing across national borders. We call
    the market in which people or firms use one currency to purchase
    another currency the</span> **foreign exchange market**.

    rate as given, as if it were a fact of nature. In reality, the
    exchange rate is a price—the price of one currency expressed in
    terms of units of another currency. The key framework for analyzing
    prices, whether in this course, any other economics course, in
    public policy, or business examples, is the operation of supply and
    demand in markets.

      

      

    The Extraordinary Size of the Foreign Exchange Markets

    The quantities traded in foreign exchange markets are breathtaking.
    A 2013 Bank of International Settlements survey found that $5.3
    trillion *per day* was traded on foreign exchange markets, which
    makes the foreign exchange market the largest market in the world
    economy. In contrast, 2013 U.S. real GDP was $15.8 trillion *per
    year*.

    <a href="#bookmark1292" class="a">Table 16.1</a> <span
    class="p">shows the currencies most commonly traded on foreign
    exchange markets. The U.S. dollar dominates the foreign exchange
    market, followed by the euro, the British pound, the Australian
    dollar, and the Japanese yen.</span>

    Demanders and Suppliers of Currency in Foreign Exchange Markets

    <span id="bookmark1293">In foreign exchange markets, demand and
    supply become closely interrelated, because a person or firm who
    demands one currency must at the same time supply another
    currency—and vice versa. To get a sense of this, it is useful to
    consider four groups of people or firms who participate in the
    market: (1) firms that are involved in international trade of goods
    and services; (2) tourists visiting other countries; (3)
    international investors buying ownership (or part- ownership) of a
    foreign firm; (4) international investors making financial
    investments that do not involve ownership. Let’s consider these
    categories in turn.</span>

    Firms that buy and sell on international markets find that their
    costs for workers, suppliers, and investors are measured

      

      

    in the currency of the nation where their production occurs, but
    their revenues from sales are measured in the currency of the
    different nation where their sales happened. Thus, a Chinese firm
    exporting abroad will earn some other currency—say, U.S. dollars—but
    will need Chinese yuan to pay the workers, suppliers, and investors
    who are based in China. In the foreign exchange markets, this firm
    will be a supplier of U.S. dollars and a demander of Chinese yuan.

    International tourists will supply their home currency to receive
    the currency of the country they are visiting. For example, an
    American tourist who is visiting China will supply U.S. dollars into
    the foreign exchange market and demand Chinese yuan.

    <span id="bookmark1294">We often divide financial investments that
    cross international boundaries, and require exchanging currency into
    two categories.</span> **Foreign direct investment (FDI)** refers to
    purchasing a firm (at least ten percent) in another country or
    starting up a new enterprise in a foreign country For example, in
    2008 the Belgian beer-brewing company InBev bought the U.S.
    beer-maker Anheuser-Busch for $52 billion. To make this purchase,
    InBev would have to supply euros (the currency of Belgium) to the
    foreign exchange market and demand U.S. dollars.

    <span id="bookmark1295">The other kind of international financial
    investment,</span> **portfolio investment**, involves a purely
    financial investment that does not entail any management
    responsibility. An example would be a U.S. financial investor who
    purchased

    U.K. government bonds, or deposited money in a British bank. To make
    such investments, the American investor would supply U.S. dollars in
    the foreign exchange market and demand British pounds.

    Business people often link portfolio investment to expectations
    about how exchange rates will shift. Look at a U.S. financial
    investor who is considering purchasing U.K. issued bonds. For
    simplicity, ignore any bond interest payment (which will be small in
    the short run anyway) and focus on exchange rates. Say that a
    British pound is currently worth

    <a href="#bookmark1296" class="s34">$1.50 in U.S. currency. However, the investor believes that in a month, the British pound will be worth $1.60 in U.S. currency. Thus, as</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1296" class="a">Figure 16.2</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1296" class="s34">(a) shows, this investor would change $24,000 for 16,000 British pounds. In a month, if the pound is worth $1.60, then the portfolio investor can trade back to U.S. dollars at the new exchange rate, and have $25,600—a nice profit. A portfolio investor who believes that the foreign exchange rate for the pound will work in the opposite direction can also invest accordingly. Say that an investor expects that the pound, now worth $1.50 in U.S. currency, will decline to $1.40. Then, as</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1296" class="a">Figure 16.2</a> <span
    class="p">(b) shows, that investor could start off with £20,000 in
    British currency (borrowing the money if necessary), convert it to
    $30,000 in U.S. currency, wait a month, and then convert back to
    approximately £21,429 in British currency—again making a nice
    profit. Of course, this kind of investing comes without guarantees,
    and an investor will suffer losses if the exchange rates do not move
    as predicted.</span>

    <span id="bookmark1296">Figure 16.2 A Portfolio Investor Trying to
    Benefit from Exchange Rate Movements</span> <span
    class="s37">Expectations of a currency's future value can drive its
    demand and supply in foreign exchange markets.</span>

      

    <span id="bookmark1297">Many portfolio investment decisions are not
    as simple as betting that the currency's value will change in one
    direction or the other. Instead, they involve firms trying to
    protect themselves from movements in exchange rates. Imagine you are
    running a U.S. firm that is exporting to France. You have signed a
    contract to deliver certain products and will receive 1 million
    euros a year from now. However, you do not know how much this
    contract will be worth in U.S. dollars, because the dollar/euro
    exchange rate can fluctuate in the next year. Let’s say you want to
    know for sure what the contract will be worth, and not take a risk
    that the euro will be worth less in U.S. dollars than it currently
    is. You can</span> **hedge**, which means using a financial
    transaction to protect yourself against a risk from one of your
    investments (in this case, currency risk from the contract).
    Specifically, you can sign a financial contract and pay a fee that
    guarantees you a certain exchange rate one year from now—regardless
    of what the market exchange rate is at that time. Now, it is
    possible that the euro will be worth more in dollars a year from
    now, so your hedging contract will be unnecessary, and you will have
    paid a fee for nothing. However, if the value of the euro in dollars
    declines, then you are protected by the hedge. When parties wish to
    enter financial contracts like hedging, they normally rely on a
    financial institution or brokerage company to handle the hedging.
    These companies either take a fee or create a spread in the exchange
    rate in order to earn money through the service they provide.

    <a href="#bookmark1298" class="s34">Both foreign direct investment and portfolio investment involve an investor who supplies domestic currency and demands a foreign currency. With portfolio investment, the client purchases less than ten percent of a company. As such, business players often get involved with portfolio investment with a short term focus. With foreign direct investment the investor purchases more than ten percent of a company and the investor typically assumes some managerial responsibility. Thus, foreign direct investment tends to have a more long-run focus. As a practical matter, an investor can withdraw portfolio investments from a country much more quickly than foreign direct investments. A U.S. portfolio investor who wants to buy or sell U.K. government bonds can do so with a phone call or a few computer keyboard clicks. However, a U.S. firm that wants to buy or sell a company, such as one that manufactures automobile parts in the United Kingdom, will find that planning and carrying out the transaction takes a few weeks, even months.</a>

    Table 16.2 The Demand and Supply Line-ups in Foreign Exchange
    Markets

      

    Participants in the Exchange Rate Market

    The foreign exchange market does not involve the ultimate suppliers
    and demanders of foreign exchange literally seeking each other. If
    Martina decides to leave her home in Venezuela and take a trip in
    the United States, she does not need to find a U.S. citizen who is
    planning to take a vacation in Venezuela and arrange a
    person-to-person currency trade. Instead, the foreign exchange
    market works through financial institutions, and it operates on
    several levels.

    <span id="bookmark1299">Most people and firms who are exchanging a
    substantial quantity of currency go to a bank, and most banks
    provide foreign exchange as a service to customers. These banks (and
    a few other firms), known as dealers, then trade the foreign
    exchange. This is called the interbank market.</span><span
    id="bookmark1300">‌</span>

      

      

    In the world economy, roughly 2,000 firms are foreign exchange
    dealers. The U.S. economy has less than 100 foreign exchange
    dealers, but the largest 12 or so dealers carry out more than half
    the total transactions. The foreign exchange market has no central
    location, but the major dealers keep a close watch on each other at
    all times.

    The foreign exchange market is huge not because of the demands of
    tourists, firms, or even foreign direct investment, but instead
    because of portfolio investment and the actions of interlocking
    foreign exchange dealers. International tourism is a very large
    industry, involving about $1 trillion per year. Global exports are
    about 23% of global GDP; which is about $18 trillion per year.
    Foreign direct investment totaled about $1.5 trillion in the end
    of 2013. These quantities are dwarfed, however, by the $5.3 trillion
    *per day* traded in foreign exchange markets. Most transactions in
    the foreign exchange market are for portfolio investment—relatively
    short-term movements of financial capital between currencies—and
    because of the large foreign exchange dealers' actions as they
    constantly buy and sell with each other.

    Strengthening and Weakening Currency

    <span id="bookmark1301">When the prices of most goods and services
    change, the price "rises or "falls". For exchange rates, the
    terminology is different. When the exchange rate for a currency
    rises, so that the currency exchanges for more of other currencies,
    we refer to it as</span> **appreciating** or “strengthening.” When
    the exchange rate for a currency falls, so that a currency trades
    for less of other currencies, we refer to it as **depreciating** or
    “weakening.”<span id="bookmark1302">‌</span>

    <a href="#bookmark1303" class="s34">To illustrate the use of these terms, consider the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar since 1980, in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1303" class="a">Figure 16.3</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1303" class="s34">(a). The vertical axis in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1303" class="a">Figure 16.3</a> <span
    class="p">(a) shows the price of $1 in U.S. currency, measured in
    terms of Canadian currency. Clearly, exchange rates can move up and
    down substantially. A U.S. dollar traded for $1.17 Canadian in 1980.
    The U.S. dollar appreciated or strengthened to $1.39 Canadian in
    1986, depreciated or weakened to $1.15 Canadian in 1991, and then
    appreciated or strengthened to $1.60 Canadian by early in 2002, fell
    to roughly $1.20 Canadian in 2009, and then had a sharp spike up and
    decline in 2009 and 2010. In May of 2017, the U.S. dollar stood at
    $1.36 Canadian. The units in which we measure exchange rates can be
    confusing, because we measure the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar
    exchange using a different currency—the Canadian dollar. However,
    exchange rates always measure the price of one unit of currency by
    using a different currency.</span>

    <span id="bookmark1303">Figure 16.3 Strengthen or Appreciate vs.
    Weaken or Depreciate</span> <span class="s37">Exchange rates tend to
    fluctuate substantially, even between bordering companies such as
    the United States and Canada. By looking closely at the time values
    (the years vary slightly on these graphs), it is clear that the
    values in part (a) are a mirror image of part (b), which
    demonstrates that the depreciation of one currency correlates to the
    appreciation of the other and vice versa. This means that when
    comparing the exchange rates between two countries (in this case,
    the United States and Canada), the depreciation (or weakening) of
    one country (the U.S. dollar for this example) indicates the
    appreciation (or strengthening) of the other currency (which in this
    example is the Canadian dollar). (Source: Federal Reserve Economic
    Data (FRED)

    <a href="#bookmark1303" class="s34">In looking at the exchange rate between two currencies, the appreciation or strengthening of one currency must mean the depreciation or weakening of the other.</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1303" class="a">Figure 16.3</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1303" class="s34">(b) shows the exchange rate for the Canadian dollar, measured in terms of U.S. dollars. The exchange rate of the U.S. dollar measured in Canadian dollars, in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1303" class="a">Figure</a> 16.3

    <a href="#bookmark1303" class="a">Figure 16.3</a> <span
    class="p">(b). A fall in the Canada $/U.S. $ ratio means a rise in
    the U.S. $/Canada $ ratio, and vice versa.</span>

      

      

    <a href="#bookmark1305" class="s34">With the price of a typical good or service, it is clear that higher prices benefit sellers and hurt buyers, while lower prices benefit buyers and hurt sellers. In the case of exchange rates, where the buyers and sellers are not always intuitively obvious, it is useful to trace how a stronger or weaker currency will affect different market participants. Consider, for example, the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on six different groups of economic actors, as</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1305" class="a">Figure</a> 16.4 <span
    class="p">shows: (1) U.S. exporters selling abroad; (2) foreign
    exporters (that is, firms selling imports in the U.S.

        States; (5) U.S. investors (either foreign direct investment or
        portfolio investment) considering opportunities in other
        countries; (6) and foreign investors considering opportunities
        in the U.S. economy.

    strong U.S. dollar means that foreign currencies are correspondingly
    weak. When this exporting firm earns foreign currencies through its
    export sales, and then converts them back to U.S. dollars to pay
    workers, suppliers, and investors, the stronger dollar means that
    the foreign currency buys fewer U.S. dollars than if the currency
    had not strengthened, and that the firm’s profits (as measured in
    dollars) fall. As a result, the firm may choose to reduce its
    exports, or it may raise its selling price, which will also tend to
    reduce its exports. In this way, a stronger currency reduces a
    country’s exports.

    Conversely, for a foreign firm selling in the U.S. economy, a
    stronger dollar is a blessing. Each dollar earned through export
    sales, when traded back into the exporting firm's home currency,
    will now buy more home currency than expected before the dollar had
    strengthened. As a result, the stronger dollar means that the
    importing firm will earn higher profits than expected. The firm will
    seek to expand its sales in the U.S. economy, or it may reduce
    prices, which will also lead to expanded sales. In this way, a
    stronger U.S. dollar means that consumers will purchase more from
    foreign producers, expanding the country’s level of imports.

    For a U.S. tourist abroad, who is exchanging U.S. dollars for
    foreign currency as necessary, a stronger U.S. dollar is a benefit.
    The tourist receives more foreign currency for each U.S. dollar, and
    consequently the cost of the trip in

    U.S. dollars is lower. When a country’s currency is strong, it is a
    good time for citizens of that country to tour abroad. Imagine a
    U.S. tourist who has saved up $5,000 for a trip to South Africa. In
    2010, $1 bought 7.3 South African rand, so the tourist had 36,500
    rand to spend. In 2012, $1 bought 8.2 rand, so the tourist had
    41,000 rand to spend. By 2015, $1 bought nearly 13 rand. Clearly,
    more recent years have been better for U.S. tourists to visit South
    Africa. For foreign visitors to the United States, the opposite
    pattern holds true. A relatively stronger U.S. dollar means that
    their own currencies are relatively weaker, so that as they shift
    from their own currency to U.S. dollars, they have fewer

    U.S. dollars than previously. When a country’s currency is strong,
    it is not an especially good time for foreign tourists to visit.

    A stronger dollar injures the prospects of a U.S. financial investor
    who has already invested money in another country. A U.S. financial
    investor abroad must first convert U.S. dollars to a foreign
    currency, invest in a foreign country, and then later convert that
    foreign currency back to U.S. dollars. If in the meantime the U.S.
    dollar becomes stronger and

      

      

    the foreign currency becomes weaker, then when the investor converts
    back to U.S. dollars, the rate of return on that investment will be
    less than originally expected at the time it was made.

    However, a stronger U.S. dollar boosts the returns of a foreign
    investor putting money into a U.S. investment. That foreign investor
    converts from the home currency to U.S. dollars and seeks a U.S.
    investment, while later planning to switch back to the home
    currency. If, in the meantime, the dollar grows stronger, then when
    the time comes to convert from U.S. dollars back to the foreign
    currency, the investor will receive more foreign currency than
    expected at the time the original investment was made.

    16.4 <span class="p">illustrates the corresponding happy or unhappy
    economic reactions. The following Work It Out feature centers the
    analysis on the opposite: a weaker dollar.</span>

      

    Effects of a Weaker Dollar

    Let’s work through the effects of a weaker dollar on a U.S.
    exporter, a foreign exporter into the United States, a U.S. tourist
    going abroad, a foreign tourist coming to the United States, a U.S.
    investor abroad, and a foreign investor in the United States.

    Step 1. Note that the demand for U.S. exports is a function of the
    price of those exports, which depends on the dollar price of those
    goods and the exchange rate of the dollar in terms of foreign
    currency. For example, a Ford pickup truck costs $25,000 in the
    United States. When it is sold in the United Kingdom, the price is

    $25,000 / $1.30 per British pound, or £19,231. The dollar affects
    the price foreigners face who may purchase

    U.S. exports.

    Step 2. Consider that, if the dollar weakens, the pound rises in
    value. If the pound rises to $2.00 per pound, then the price of a
    Ford pickup is now $25,000 / $2.00 = £12,500. A weaker dollar means
    the foreign currency buys more dollars, which means that U.S.
    exports appear less expensive.

    Step 3. Summarize that a weaker U.S. dollar leads to an increase in
    U.S. exports. For a foreign exporter, the outcome is just the
    opposite.

    Step 4. Suppose a brewery in England is interested in selling its
    Bass Ale to a grocery store in the United States. If the price of a
    six pack of Bass Ale is £6.00 and the exchange rate is $1.30 per
    British pound, the price for the grocery store is 6.00 × $1.30 =
    $7.80 per six pack. If the dollar weakens to $2.00 per pound, the
    price of Bass Ale is now 6.00 × $2.00 = $12.

    Step 5. Summarize that, from the perspective of U.S. purchasers, a
    weaker dollar means that foreign currency is more expensive, which
    means that foreign goods are more expensive also. This leads to a
    decrease in U.S. imports, which is bad for the foreign exporter.

    Step 6. Consider U.S. tourists going abroad. They face the same
    situation as a U.S. importer—they are purchasing a foreign trip. A
    weaker dollar means that their trip will cost more, since a given
    expenditure of foreign currency (e.g., hotel bill) will take more
    dollars. The result is that the tourist may not stay as long abroad,
    and some may choose not to travel at all.

    Step 7. Consider that, for the foreign tourist to the United States,
    a weaker dollar is a boon. It means their currency goes further, so
    the cost of a trip to the United States will be less. Foreigners may
    choose to take longer trips to the United States, and more foreign
    tourists may decide to take U.S. trips.

    Step 8. Note that a U.S. investor abroad faces the same situation as
    a U.S. importer—they are purchasing a foreign asset. A U.S. investor
    will see a weaker dollar as an increase in the “price” of
    investment, since the same number of dollars will buy less foreign
    currency and thus less foreign assets. This should decrease the
    amount of U.S. investment abroad.

    Step 9. Note also that foreign investors in the Unites States will
    have the opposite experience. Since foreign currency buys more
    dollars, they will likely invest in more U.S. assets.

      

    At this point, you should have a good sense of the major players in
    the foreign exchange market: firms involved in

    Why is a stronger currency not necessarily better?

    One common misunderstanding about exchange rates is that a
    “stronger” or “appreciating” currency must be better than a “weaker”
    or “depreciating” currency. After all, is it not obvious that
    “strong” is better than “weak”? Do not let the terminology confuse
    you. When a currency becomes stronger, so that it purchases more of
    other currencies, it benefits some in the economy and injures
    others. Stronger currency is not necessarily better, it is just
    different.

    international trade, tourists, international financial investors,
    banks, and foreign exchange dealers. The next module shows how
    players can use the tools of demand and supply in foreign exchange
    markets to explain the underlying causes of stronger and weaker
    currencies (we address “stronger” and “weaker” more in the following
    Clear It Up feature).

each Mexican peso and a total volume of 85 billion pesos. Note that the
two exchange rates are inverses: 10 pesos per dollar is the same as 10
cents per peso (or $0.10 per peso). In the actual foreign exchange
market, almost all of the trading for Mexican pesos is for U.S. dollars.
What factors would cause the demand or supply to shift, thus leading to
a change in the equilibrium exchange rate? We discuss the answer to this
question in the following section.</span><span
id="bookmark1309">‌</span><span id="bookmark1310">‌</span>

Expectations about Future Exchange Rates

One reason to demand a currency on the foreign exchange market is the
belief that the currency's value is about to increase. One reason to
supply a currency—that is, sell it on the foreign exchange market—is the
expectation that the currency's value is about to decline. For example,
imagine that a leading business newspaper, like the *Wall Street
Journal* or the *Financial
Times*<a href="#bookmark1311" class="s34">, runs an article predicting that the Mexican peso will appreciate in value.</a>
<a href="#bookmark1311" class="a">Figure</a> <span class="s54">16.6
</span>illustrates the likely effects of such an article. Demand for the
Mexican peso shifts to the right, from D<span class="s60">0</span> to
D<span class="s60">1</span>, as investors become eager to purchase
pesos. Conversely, the supply of pesos shifts to the left, from S<span
class="s60">0</span> to S<span class="s60">1</span>, because investors
will be less willing to give them up. The result is that the equilibrium
exchange rate rises from 10 cents/peso to 12 cents/peso and the
equilibrium exchange rate rises from 85 billion to 90 billion pesos as
the equilibrium moves from E<span class="s60">0</span> to E<span
class="s60">1</span>.

  

<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_343.jpg" width="218" height="203" alt="image" />

<span id="bookmark1311">Figure 16.6 Exchange Rate Market for Mexican
Peso Reacts to Expectations about Future Exchange Rates</span> <span
class="s37">An announcement that the peso exchange rate is likely to
strengthen in the future will lead to greater demand for the peso in the
present from investors who wish to benefit from the appreciation.
Similarly, it will make investors less likely to supply pesos to the
foreign exchange market. Both the shift of demand to the right and the
shift of supply to the left cause an immediate appreciation in the
exchange rate.</span>

  

<a href="#bookmark1311" id="bookmark1312" class="a">Figure 16.6</a>
<span class="p">also illustrates some peculiar traits of supply and
demand diagrams in the foreign exchange market. In contrast to all the
other cases of supply and demand you have considered, in the foreign
exchange market, supply and demand typically both move at the same time.
Groups of participants in the foreign exchange market like firms and
investors include some who are buyers and some who are sellers. An
expectation of a future shift in the exchange rate affects both buyers
and sellers—that is, it affects both demand and supply for a
currency.</span>

The shifts in demand and supply curves both cause the exchange rate to
shift in the same direction. In this example, they both make the peso
exchange rate stronger. However, the shifts in demand and supply work in
opposing directions on the quantity traded. In this example, the rising
demand for pesos is causing the quantity to rise while the falling
supply of pesos is causing quantity to fall. In this specific example,
the result is a higher quantity. However, in other cases, the result
could be that quantity remains unchanged or declines.

This example also helps to explain why exchange rates often move quite
substantially in a short period of a few weeks or months. When investors
expect a country’s currency to strengthen in the future, they buy the
currency and cause it to appreciate immediately. The currency's
appreciation can lead other investors to believe that future
appreciation is likely—and thus lead to even further appreciation.
Similarly, a fear that a currency *might* weaken quickly leads to an
*actual* weakening of the currency, which often reinforces the belief
that the currency will weaken further. Thus, beliefs about the future
path of exchange rates can be self-reinforcing, at least for a time, and
a large share of the trading in foreign exchange markets involves
dealers trying to outguess each other on what direction exchange rates
will move next.

Differences across Countries in Rates of Return

The motivation for investment, whether domestic or foreign, is to earn a
return. If rates of return in a country look relatively high, then that
country will tend to attract funds from abroad. Conversely, if rates of
return in a country look relatively low, then funds will tend to flee to
other economies. Changes in the expected rate of return will shift
demand and supply for a currency. For example, imagine that interest
rates rise in the United States as compared with Mexico. Thus, financial
investments in the United States promise a higher return than
previously. As a result, more investors will demand U.S. dollars so that
they can buy interest-bearing assets and fewer investors will be willing
to supply U.S. dollars to foreign exchange markets. Demand for the U.S.
dollar will shift to the right, from D<span class="s60">0</span> to
D<span class="s60">1</span>, and supply will shift to the left, from
S<span class="s60">0</span> to S<span
class="s60">1</span><a href="#bookmark1313" class="s34">, as</a>
<a href="#bookmark1313" class="a">Figure 16.7</a><span class="s54">
</span>shows. The new equilibrium (E<span class="s60">1</span>), will
occur at an exchange rate of nine pesos/dollar and the same quantity of
$8.5 billion. Thus, a higher interest rate or rate of return relative to
other countries leads a nation’s currency to appreciate or strengthen,
and a lower interest rate relative to other countries leads a nation’s
currency to depreciate or weaken. Since a nation’s central bank can use
monetary policy to affect its interest rates, a central bank can also
cause changes in exchange rates—a connection that we will discuss in
more detail later in this chapter.

dollars shifts to the left, from S<span class="s63">0</span> to S<span

has a stronger exchange rate than the original equilibrium (E<span

traded does not change.

  

Relative Inflation

<a href="#bookmark1314" class="s34">If a country experiences a relatively high inflation rate compared with other economies, then the buying power of its currency is eroding, which will tend to discourage anyone from wanting to acquire or to hold the currency.</a>

</span><a href="#bookmark1314" class="s34">shows an example based on an actual episode concerning the Mexican peso. In 1986–87, Mexico experienced an inflation rate of over 200%. Not surprisingly, as inflation dramatically decreased the peso's purchasing power in Mexico. The peso's exchange rate value declined as well.</a>
<a href="#bookmark1314" class="a">Figure 16.8</a><span class="s54">
</span>shows that the demand for the peso on foreign exchange markets
decreased from D<span class="s60">0</span> to D<span
class="s60">1</span>, while the peso's supply increased from S<span
class="s60">0</span> to S<span class="s60">1</span>. The equilibrium
exchange rate fell from $2.50 per peso at the original equilibrium
(E<span class="s60">0</span>) to $0.50 per peso at the new equilibrium
(E<span class="s60">1</span>). In this example, the quantity of pesos
traded on foreign exchange markets remained the same, even as the
exchange rate shifted.

supply to increase from S<span class="s63">0</span> to S<span
class="s63">1</span>. Both movements in demand and supply would cause
the currency to depreciate. Here, we draw the effect on the quantity
traded as a decrease, but in truth it could be an increase or no change,
depending on the actual movements of demand and supply.

Purchasing Power Parity

Over the long term, exchange rates must bear some relationship to the
currency's buying power in terms of internationally traded goods. If at
a certain exchange rate it was much cheaper to buy internationally
traded goods—such as oil, steel, computers, and cars—in one country than
in another country, businesses would start buying in the cheap country,
selling in other countries, and pocketing the profits.

For example, if a U.S. dollar is worth $1.30 in Canadian currency, then
a car that sells for $20,000 in the United States should sell for
$26,000 in Canada. If the price of cars in Canada were much lower than
$26,000, then at least some

<span id="bookmark1315">U.S. car-buyers would convert their U.S. dollars
to Canadian dollars and buy their cars in Canada. If the price of cars
were much higher than $26,000 in this example, then at least some
Canadian buyers would convert their Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars and
go to the United States to purchase their cars. This is known as</span>
**arbitrage**, the process of buying and selling goods or currencies
across international borders at a profit. It may occur slowly, but over
time, it will force prices and exchange rates to align so that the price
of internationally traded goods is similar in all countries.

<span id="bookmark1316">We call the exchange rate that equalizes the
prices of internationally traded goods across countries the</span>
**purchasing power parity (PPP)** exchange rate. A group of economists
at the International Comparison Program, run by the World Bank, have
calculated the PPP exchange rate for all countries, based on detailed
studies of the prices and quantities of internationally tradable goods.

<span id="bookmark1317">The purchasing power parity exchange rate has
two functions. First, economists often use PPP exchange rates for
international comparison of GDP and other economic statistics. Imagine
that you are preparing a table showing the size of GDP in many countries
in several recent years, and for ease of comparison, you are converting
all the values into U.S. dollars. When you insert the value for Japan,
you need to use a yen/dollar exchange rate. However, should you use the
market exchange rate or the PPP exchange rate? Market exchange rates
bounce around. In 2014, the exchange rate was 105 yen/dollar, but in
late 2015 the U.S. dollar exchange rate versus the yen was 121
yen/dollar. For simplicity, say that Japan’s GDP was ¥500 trillion in
both 2014 and 2015. If you use the market exchange rates, then Japan’s
GDP will be $4.8 trillion in 2014 (that is, ¥500 trillion
/(¥105/dollar)) and $4.1 trillion in 2015 (that is,</span>

¥500 trillion /(¥121/dollar)).

The misleading appearance of a changing Japanese economy occurs only
because we used the market exchange rate, which often has short-run
rises and falls. However, PPP exchange rates stay fairly constant and
change only modestly, if at all, from year to year.

The second function of PPP is that exchanges rates will often get closer
to it as time passes. It is true that in the short and medium run, as
exchange rates adjust to relative inflation rates, rates of return, and
to expectations about how interest rates and inflation will shift, the
exchange rates will often move away from the PPP exchange rate for a
time. However, knowing the PPP will allow you to track and predict
exchange rate relationships.

    Rates</span><span id="bookmark1318">‌</span>

    By the end of this section you will be able to:

    -   Explain how exchange rate shifting influences aggregate demand
        and supply

    -   Explain how shifting exchange rates also can influence loans and
        banks

          

        <span id="bookmark1319">A central bank will be concerned about
        the exchange rate for multiple reasons: (1) Movements in the
        exchange rate will affect the quantity of aggregate demand in an
        economy; (2) frequent substantial fluctuations in the exchange
        rate can disrupt international trade and cause problems in a
        nation’s banking system–this may contribute to an unsustainable
        balance of trade and large inflows of international financial
        capital, which can set up the economy for a deep recession if
        international investors decide to move their money to another
        country. Let’s discuss these scenarios in turn.</span>

        Exchange Rates, Aggregate Demand, and Aggregate Supply

        <span id="bookmark1320">Foreign trade in goods and services
        typically involves incurring the costs of production in one
        currency while receiving revenues from sales in another
        currency. As a result, movements in exchange rates can have a
        powerful effect on incentives to export and import, and thus on
        aggregate demand in the economy as a whole.</span>

        <span id="bookmark1321">For example, in 1999, when the euro
        first became a currency, its value measured in U.S. currency was
        $1.06/euro. By the end of 2013, the euro had risen (and the U.S.
        dollar had correspondingly weakened) to $1.37/euro. However, by
        the end of February, 2017, the exchange rate was once again
        $1.06/euro. Consider the situation of a French firm that each
        year incurs €10 million in costs, and sells its products in the
        United States for $10 million. In 1999, when this firm converted
        $10 million back to euros at the exchange rate of $1.06/euro
        (that is, $10 million × \[€1/$1.06\]), it received €9.4 million,
        and suffered a loss. In 2013, when this same firm converted $10
        million back to euros at the exchange rate of $1.37/euro (that
        is, $10 million × \[€1 euro/$1.37\]), it received approximately
        €7.3 million and an even larger loss. In the beginning of 2017,
        with the exchange rate back at $1.06/euro the firm would suffer
        a loss once again. This example shows how a stronger euro
        discourages exports by the French firm, because it makes the
        costs of production in the domestic currency higher relative to
        the sales revenues earned in another country. From the point of
        view of the U.S. economy, the example also shows how a weaker
        U.S. dollar encourages exports.</span>

        Since an increase in exports results in more dollars flowing
        into the economy, and an increase in imports means more dollars
        are flowing out, it is easy to conclude that exports are “good”
        for the economy and imports are “bad,” but this overlooks the
        role of exchange rates. If an American consumer buys a Japanese
        car for $20,000 instead of an American car for $30,000, it may
        be tempting to argue that the American economy has lost out.
        However, the Japanese company will have to convert those dollars
        to yen to pay its workers and operate its factories. Whoever
        buys those dollars will have to use them to purchase American
        goods and services, so the money comes right back into the
        American economy. At the same time, the consumer saves money by
        buying a less expensive import, and can use the extra money for
        other purposes.

        Fluctuations in Exchange Rates

        <a href="#bookmark1322" class="s34">Exchange rates can fluctuate a great deal in the short run. As yet one more example, the Indian rupee moved from 39 rupees/dollar in February 2008 to 51 rupees/dollar in March 2009, a decline of more than one-fourth in the value of the rupee on foreign exchange markets.</a>
        <a href="#bookmark1322" class="a">Figure 16.9</a> <span
        class="p">earlier showed that even two economically developed
        neighboring economies like the United States and Canada can see
        significant movements in exchange rates over a few years. For
        firms that depend on export sales, or firms that rely on
        imported inputs to production, or even purely domestic firms
        that compete with firms tied into international trade—which in
        many countries adds up to half or more of a nation’s GDP—sharp
        movements in exchange rates can lead to dramatic changes in
        profits and losses. A central bank may desire to keep exchange
        rates from moving too much as part of providing a stable
        business climate, where firms can focus on productivity and
        innovation, not on reacting to exchange rate
        fluctuations.</span>

        <a href="#bookmark1322" class="s34">One of the most economically destructive effects of exchange rate fluctuations can happen through the banking system. Financial institutions measure most international loans are measured in a few large currencies, like U.S. dollars, European euros, and Japanese yen. In countries that do not use these currencies, banks often borrow funds in the currencies of other countries, like U.S. dollars, but then lend in their own domestic currency. The left-hand chain of events in</a>
        <a href="#bookmark1322" class="a">Figure 16.9</a> <span
        class="p">shows how this pattern of international borrowing can
        work. A bank in Thailand borrows one million in U.S. dollars.
        Then the bank converts the dollars to its domestic currency—in
        the case of Thailand, the</span>

          

          

        currency is the baht—at a rate of 40 baht/dollar. The bank then
        lends the baht to a firm in Thailand. The business repays the
        loan in baht, and the bank converts it back to U.S. dollars to
        pay off its original U.S. dollar loan.

        Borrowing</span> <span class="s37">The scenario of international
        borrowing that ends on the left is a success story, but the
        scenario that ends on the right shows what happens when the
        exchange rate weakens.</span>

          

        <a href="#bookmark1322" class="s34">This process of borrowing in a foreign currency and lending in a domestic currency can work just fine, as long as the exchange rate does not shift. In the scenario outlined, if the dollar strengthens and the baht weakens, a problem arises. The right-hand chain of events in</a>
        <a href="#bookmark1322" class="a">Figure 16.9</a> <span
        class="p">illustrates what happens when the baht unexpectedly
        weakens from 40 baht/dollar to 50 baht/dollar. The Thai firm
        still repays the loan in full to the bank. However, because of
        the shift in the exchange rate, the bank cannot repay its loan
        in U.S. dollars. (Of course, if the exchange rate had changed in
        the other direction, making the Thai currency stronger, the bank
        could have realized an unexpectedly large profit.)</span>

        <span id="bookmark1323">In 1997–1998, countries across eastern
        Asia, like Thailand, Korea, Malaysia, and Indonesia, experienced
        a sharp depreciation of their currencies, in some cases 50% or
        more. These countries had been experiencing substantial inflows
        of foreign investment capital, with bank lending increasing by
        20% to 30% per year through the mid-1990s. When their exchange
        rates depreciated, the banking systems in these countries were
        bankrupt. Argentina experienced a similar chain of events
        in 2002. When the Argentine peso depreciated, Argentina’s banks
        found themselves unable to pay back what they had borrowed in
        U.S. dollars.</span>

        <span id="bookmark1324">Banks play a vital role in any economy
        in facilitating transactions and in making loans to firms and
        consumers. When most of a country’s largest banks become
        bankrupt simultaneously, a sharp decline in aggregate demand and
        a deep recession results. Since the main responsibilities of a
        central bank are to control the money supply and to ensure that
        the banking system is stable, a central bank must be concerned
        about whether large and unexpected exchange rate depreciation
        will drive most of the country’s existing banks into bankruptcy.

        Summing Up Public Policy and Exchange Rates

        <span id="bookmark1325">Every nation would prefer a stable
        exchange rate to facilitate international trade and reduce the
        degree of risk and uncertainty in the economy. However, a nation
        may sometimes want a weaker exchange rate to stimulate aggregate
        demand and reduce a recession, or a stronger exchange rate to
        fight inflation. The country must also be concerned that rapid
        movements from a weak to a strong exchange rate may cripple its
        export industries, while rapid movements from a strong to a weak
        exchange rate can cripple its banking sector. In short, every
        choice of an exchange rate—whether it should be stronger or
        weaker, or fixed or changing—represents potential
        tradeoffs.</span>

<a href="#bookmark1327" class="s34">Exchange rate policies come in a range of different forms listed in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1327" class="a">Figure</a> 16.10<span class="p">: let
the foreign exchange market determine the exchange rate; let the market
set the value of the exchange rate most of the time, but have the
central bank sometimes intervene to prevent fluctuations that seem too
large; have the central bank guarantee a specific exchange rate; or
share a currency with other countries. Let’s discuss each type of
exchange rate policy and its tradeoffs.</span>

  

<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_348.jpg" width="547" height="147" alt="image" />

<span id="bookmark1327">Figure 16.10 A Spectrum of Exchange Rate
Policies</span> <span class="s37">A nation may adopt one of a variety of
exchange rate regimes, from floating rates in which the foreign exchange
market determines the rates to pegged rates where governments intervene
to manage the exchange rate's value, to a common currency where the
nation adopts another country or group of countries' currency.</span>

Floating Exchange Rates

<span id="bookmark1328">We refer to a policy which allows the foreign
exchange market to set exchange rates as a</span> **floating exchange
rate**. The

U.S. dollar is a floating exchange rate, as are the currencies of about
40% of the countries in the world economy. The major concern with this
policy is that exchange rates can move a great deal in a short time.

<a href="#bookmark1329" class="s34">Consider the U.S. exchange rate expressed in terms of another fairly stable currency, the Japanese yen, as</a>
[Figure](#bookmark1329)

<a href="#bookmark1329" class="a">16.11</a> <span class="p">shows. On
January 1, 2002, the exchange rate was 133 yen/dollar. On January 1,
2005, it was 103 yen/dollar. On June 1, 2007, it was 122 yen/dollar, on
January 1, 2012, it was 77 yen per dollar, and on March 1, 2015, it was
120 yen per dollar. As investor sentiment swings back and forth, driving
exchange rates up and down, exporters, importers, and banks involved in
international lending are all affected. At worst, large movements in
exchange rates can drive companies into bankruptcy or trigger a
nationwide banking collapse. However, even in the moderate case of the
yen/dollar exchange rate, these movements of roughly 30 percent back and
forth impose stress on both economies as firms must alter their export
and import plans to take the new exchange rates into account. Especially
in smaller countries where international trade is a relatively large
share of GDP, exchange rate movements can rattle their economies.</span>

  

<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_349.jpg" width="498" height="243" alt="image" />

  

<span id="bookmark1329">Figure 16.11 U.S. Dollar Exchange Rate in
Japanese Yen</span> <span class="s37">Even seemingly stable exchange
rates such as the Japanese Yen to the U.S. Dollar can vary when closely
examined over time. This figure shows a relatively stable rate between
2011 and 2013. In 2013, there was a drastic depreciation of the Yen
(relative to the U.S. Dollar) by about 14% and again at the end of the
year in 2014 also by about 14%. (Source: Federal Reserve Economic Data
(FRED) https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/DEXJPUS)</span><span
id="bookmark1330">‌</span>

  

However, movements of floating exchange rates have advantages, too.
After all, prices of goods and services rise and fall throughout a
market economy, as demand and supply shift. If an economy experiences
strong inflows or outflows of international financial capital, or has
relatively high inflation, or if it experiences strong productivity
growth so that purchasing power changes relative to other economies,
then it makes economic sense for the exchange rate to shift as well.

<span id="bookmark1331">Floating exchange rate advocates often argue
that if government policies were more predictable and stable, then
inflation rates and interest rates would be more predictable and stable.
Exchange rates would bounce around less, too. The economist Milton
Friedman (1912–2006), for example, wrote a defense of floating exchange
rates in 1962 in his book</span> *Capitalism and Freedom*:

Being in favor of floating exchange rates does not mean being in favor
of unstable exchange rates. When we support a free price system \[for
goods and services\] at home, this does not imply that we favor a system
in which prices fluctuate wildly up and down. What we want is a system
in which prices are free to fluctuate but in which the forces
determining them are sufficiently stable so that in fact prices move
within moderate ranges. This is equally true in a system of floating
exchange rates. The ultimate objective is a world in which exchange
rates, while free to vary, are, in fact, highly stable because basic
economic policies and conditions are stable.

Advocates of floating exchange rates admit that, yes, exchange rates may
sometimes fluctuate. They point out, however, that if a central bank
focuses on preventing either high inflation or deep recession, with low
and reasonably steady interest rates, then exchange rates will have less
reason to vary.

Using Soft Pegs and Hard Pegs

<span id="bookmark1332">When a government intervenes in the foreign
exchange market so that the currency's exchange rate is different from
what the market would have produced, it establishes a “peg” for its
currency. A</span> **soft peg** is the name for an exchange rate policy
where the government usually allows the market to set exchange rate, but
in some cases, especially if the exchange rate seems to be moving
rapidly in one direction, the central bank will intervene in the market.
With a **hard peg** exchange rate policy, the central bank sets a fixed
and unchanging value for the exchange rate. A central bank can implement
soft peg and hard peg policies.<span id="bookmark1333">‌</span>

<span class="p">Suppose the market exchange rate for the Brazilian
currency, the real, would be 35 cents/real with a daily quantity of 15
billion real traded in the market, as the equilibrium E</span><span
class="s60">0</span> <a href="#bookmark1334" class="s34">in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1334" class="a">Figure 16.12</a>
<a href="#bookmark1334" class="s34">(a) and</a>
<a href="#bookmark1334" class="a">Figure 16.12</a>
<a href="#bookmark1334" class="s34">(b) show. However, Brazil's government decides that the exchange rate should be 30 cents/real, as</a>
<a href="#bookmark1334" class="a">Figure 16.12</a> <span class="p">(a)
shows. Perhaps</span>

  

  

Brazil sets this lower exchange rate to benefit its export industries.
Perhaps it is an attempt to stimulate aggregate demand by stimulating
exports. Perhaps Brazil believes that the current market exchange rate
is higher than the long- term purchasing power parity value of the real,
so it is minimizing fluctuations in the real by keeping it at this lower
rate. Perhaps the government set the target exchange rate sometime in
the past, and it is now maintaining it for the sake of stability.
Whatever the reason, if Brazil’s central bank wishes to keep the
exchange rate below the market level, it must face the reality that at
this weaker exchange rate of 30 cents/real, the quantity demanded of its
currency at 17 billion reals is greater than the quantity supplied of 13
billion reals in the foreign exchange market.

  

<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_350.jpg" width="506" height="250" alt="image" />

<span id="bookmark1334">Figure 16.12 Pegging an Exchange Rate</span>
<span class="s37">(a) If an exchange rate is pegged below what would
otherwise be the equilibrium, then the currency's quantity demanded will
exceed the quantity supplied. (b) If an exchange rate is pegged above
what would otherwise be the equilibrium, then the currency's quantity
supplied exceeds the quantity demanded.</span>

  

<span id="bookmark1335">The Brazilian central bank could weaken its
exchange rate in two ways. One approach is to use an expansionary
monetary policy that leads to lower interest rates. In foreign exchange
markets, the lower interest rates will reduce demand and increase supply
of the real and lead to depreciation. Central banks do not use this
technique often because lowering interest rates to weaken the currency
may be in conflict with the country’s monetary policy goals.
Alternatively, Brazil’s central bank could trade directly in the foreign
exchange market. The central bank can expand the money supply by
creating reals, use the reals to purchase foreign currencies, and avoid
selling any of its own currency. In this way, it can fill the gap
between quantity demanded and quantity supplied of its
currency.</span><span id="bookmark1336">‌</span>

<a href="#bookmark1334" class="a">Figure 16.12</a> <span class="p">(b)
shows the opposite situation. Here, the Brazilian government desires a
stronger exchange rate of 40 cents/real than the market rate of 35
cents/real. Perhaps Brazil desires the stronger currency to reduce
aggregate demand and to fight inflation, or perhaps Brazil believes that
that current market exchange rate is temporarily lower than the
long-term rate. Whatever the reason, at the higher desired exchange
rate, the quantity supplied of 16 billion reals exceeds the quantity
demanded of 14 billion reals.</span>

<span id="bookmark1337">Brazil’s central bank can use a contractionary
monetary policy to raise interest rates, which will increase demand and
reduce currency supply on foreign exchange markets, and lead to an
appreciation. Alternatively, Brazil’s central bank can trade directly in
the foreign exchange market. In this case, with an excess supply of its
own currency in foreign exchange markets, the central bank must use
reserves of foreign currency, like U.S. dollars, to demand its own
currency and thus cause an appreciation of its exchange rate.</span>

Both a soft peg and a hard peg policy require that the central bank
intervene in the foreign exchange market. However, a hard peg policy
attempts to preserve a fixed exchange rate at all times. A soft peg
policy typically allows the exchange rate to move up and down by
relatively small amounts in the short run of several months or a year,
and to move by larger amounts over time, but seeks to avoid extreme
short-term fluctuations.

Tradeoffs of Soft Pegs and Hard Pegs

<span id="bookmark1338">When a country decides to alter the market
exchange rate, it faces a number of tradeoffs. If it uses monetary
policy to alter the exchange rate, it then cannot at the same time use
monetary policy to address issues of inflation or recession. If it uses
direct purchases and sales of foreign currencies in exchange rates, then
it must face the issue of how it will</span>

  

  

handle its reserves of foreign currency. Finally, a pegged exchange rate
can even create additional movements of the exchange rate. For example,
even the possibility of government intervention in exchange rate markets
will lead to rumors about whether and when the government will
intervene, and dealers in the foreign exchange market will react to
those rumors. Let’s consider these issues in turn.

<span id="bookmark1339">One concern with pegged exchange rate policies
is that they imply a country’s monetary policy is no longer focused on
controlling inflation or shortening recessions, but now must also take
the exchange rate into account. For example, when a country pegs its
exchange rate, it will sometimes face economic situations where it would
like to have an expansionary monetary policy to fight recession—but it
cannot do so because that policy would depreciate its exchange rate and
break its hard peg. With a soft peg exchange rate policy, the central
bank can sometimes ignore the exchange rate and focus on domestic
inflation or recession—but in other cases the central bank may ignore
inflation or recession and instead focus on its soft peg exchange rate.
With a hard peg policy, domestic monetary policy is effectively no
longer determined by domestic inflation or unemployment, but only by
what monetary policy is needed to keep the exchange rate at the hard
peg.</span>

<span id="bookmark1340">Another issue arises when a central bank
intervenes directly in the exchange rate market. If a central bank ends
up in a situation where it is perpetually creating and selling its own
currency on foreign exchange markets, it will be buying the currency of
other countries, like U.S. dollars or euros, to hold as reserves.
Holding large reserves of other currencies has an opportunity cost, and
central banks will not wish to boost such reserves without
limit.</span><span id="bookmark1341">‌</span>

In addition, a central bank that causes a large increase in the supply
of money is also risking an inflationary surge in aggregate demand.
Conversely, when a central bank wishes to buy its own currency, it can
do so by using its reserves of international currency like the U.S.
dollar or the euro. However, if the central bank runs out of such
reserves, it can no longer use this method to strengthen its currency.
Thus, buying foreign currencies in exchange rate markets can be
expensive and inflationary, while selling foreign currencies can work
only until a central bank runs out of reserves.

How do Tobin taxes control the flow of capital?

Some countries like Chile and Malaysia have sought to reduce movements
in exchange rates by limiting international financial capital inflows
and outflows. The government can enact this policy either through
targeted taxes or by regulations.

<span id="bookmark1343">Taxes on international capital flows are
sometimes known as</span> **Tobin taxes**, named after James Tobin, the
1981 Nobel laureate in economics who proposed such a tax in a 1972
lecture. For example, a government might tax all foreign exchange
transactions, or attempt to tax short-term portfolio investment while
exempting long-term foreign direct investment. Countries can also use
regulation to forbid certain kinds of foreign investment in the first
place or to make it difficult for international financial investors to
withdraw their funds from a country.<span
id="bookmark1344">‌</span><span id="bookmark1345">‌</span>

The goal of such policies is to reduce international capital flows,
especially short-term portfolio flows, in the hope that doing so will
reduce the chance of large movements in exchange rates that can bring
macroeconomic disaster.

<span id="bookmark1346">However, proposals to limit international
financial flows have severe practical difficulties. National governments
impose taxes, not international ones. If one government imposes a Tobin
tax on exchange rate transactions carried out within its territory, a
firm based someplace like the Grand Caymans, an island nation in the
Caribbean well-known for allowing some financial wheeling and dealing
might easily operate the exchange rate market. In an interconnected
global economy, if goods and services are allowed to flow across
national</span>

<span id="bookmark1342">Yet another issue is that when a government pegs
its exchange rate, it may unintentionally create another reason for
additional fluctuation. With a soft peg policy, foreign exchange dealers
and international investors react to every rumor about how or when the
central bank is likely to intervene to influence the exchange rate, and
as they react to rumors the exchange rate will shift up and down. Thus,
even though the goal of a soft peg policy is to reduce short-term
fluctuations of the exchange rate, the existence of the policy—when
anticipated in the foreign exchange market—may sometimes increase
short-term fluctuations as international investors try to anticipate how
and when the central bank will act. The following Clear It Up feature
discusses the effects of</span> **international capital flows**—capital
that flows across national boundaries as either portfolio investment or
direct investment.

  

  

borders, then payments need to flow across borders, too. It is very
difficult—in fact close to impossible—for a nation to allow only the
flows of payments that relate to goods and services, while clamping down
or taxing other flows of financial capital. If a nation participates in
international trade, it must also participate in international capital
movements.

Finally, countries all over the world, especially low-income countries,
are crying out for foreign investment to help develop their economies.
Policies that discourage international financial investment may prevent
some possible harm, but they rule out potentially substantial economic
benefits as well.

  

A hard peg exchange rate policy will not allow short-term fluctuations
in the exchange rate. If the government first announces a hard peg and
then later changes its mind—perhaps the government becomes unwilling to
keep interest rates high or to hold high levels of foreign exchange
reserves—then the result of abandoning a hard peg could be a dramatic
shift in the exchange rate.

In the mid-2000s, about one-third of the countries in the world used a
soft peg approach and about one-quarter used a hard peg approach. The
general trend in the 1990s was to shift away from a soft peg approach in
favor of either floating rates or a hard peg. The concern is that a
successful soft peg policy may, for a time, lead to very little
variation in exchange rates, so that firms and banks in the economy
begin to act as if a hard peg exists. When the exchange rate does move,
the effects are especially painful because firms and banks have not
planned and hedged against a possible change. Thus, the argument went,
it is better either to be clear that the exchange rate is always
flexible, or that it is fixed, but choosing an in-between soft peg
option may end up being worst of all.

A Merged Currency

<span id="bookmark1347">A final approach to exchange rate policy is for
a nation to choose a common currency shared with one or more nations is
also called a</span> **merged currency**. A merged currency approach
eliminates foreign exchange risk altogether. Just as no one worries
about exchange rate movements when buying and selling between New York
and California, Europeans know that the value of the euro will be the
same in Germany and France and other European nations that have adopted
the euro.

However, a merged currency also poses problems. Like a hard peg, a
merged currency means that a nation has given up altogether on domestic
monetary policy, and instead has put its interest rate policies in other
hands. When Ecuador uses the U.S. dollar as its currency, it has no
voice in whether the Federal Reserve raises or lowers interest rates.
The European Central Bank that determines monetary policy for the euro
has representatives from all the euro nations. However, from the
standpoint of, say, Portugal, there will be times when the decisions of
the European Central Bank about monetary policy do not match the
decisions that a Portuguese central bank would have made.

<a href="#bookmark1348" class="s34">The lines between these four different exchange rate policies can blend into each other. For example, a soft peg exchange rate policy in which the government almost never acts to intervene in the exchange rate market will look a great deal like a floating exchange rate. Conversely, a soft peg policy in which the government intervenes often to keep the exchange rate near a specific level will look a lot like a hard peg. A decision to merge currencies with another country is, in effect, a decision to have a permanently fixed exchange rate with those countries, which is like a very hard exchange rate peg.</a>

Table 16.3 Tradeoffs of Exchange Rate Policies

  

Global macroeconomics would be easier if the whole world had one
currency and one central bank. The exchange rates between different
currencies complicate the picture. If financial markets solely set
exchange rates, they fluctuate substantially as short-term portfolio
investors try to anticipate tomorrow’s news. If the government attempts
to intervene in exchange rate markets through soft pegs or hard pegs, it
gives up at least some of the power to use monetary policy to focus on
domestic inflations and recessions, and it risks causing even greater
fluctuations in foreign exchange markets.

<span id="bookmark1349">There is no consensus among economists about
which exchange rate policies are best: floating, soft peg, hard peg, or
merged currencies. The choice depends both on how well a nation’s
central bank can implement a specific exchange rate policy and on how
well a nation’s firms and banks can adapt to different exchange rate
policies. A national economy that does a fairly good job at achieving
the four main economic goals of growth, low inflation, low unemployment,
and a sustainable balance of trade will probably do just fine most of
the time with any exchange rate policy. Conversely, no exchange rate
policy is likely to save an economy that consistently fails at achieving
these goals. Alternatively, a merged currency applied across wide
geographic and cultural areas carries with it its own set of problems,
such as the ability for countries to conduct their own independent
monetary policies.</span>

Is a Stronger Dollar Good for the U.S. Economy?

The foreign exchange value of the dollar is a price and whether a higher
price is good or bad depends on where you are standing: sellers benefit
from higher prices and buyers are harmed. A stronger dollar is good for
U.S. imports (and people working for U.S. importers) and U.S. investment
abroad. It is also good for U.S. tourists going to other countries,
since their dollar goes further. However, a stronger dollar is bad for
U.S. exports (and people working in U.S. export industries); it is bad
for foreign investment in the United States (leading, for example, to
higher U.S. interest rates); and it is bad for foreign tourists (as well
as U.S hotels, restaurants, and others in the tourist industry). In
short, whether the U.S. dollar is good or bad is a more complex question
than you may have thought. The economic answer is “it depends.”

KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY

  

1.  <a href="#bookmark1288" class="a">How the Foreign Exchange Market</a>
    [Works](#bookmark1288)

    In the foreign exchange market, people and firms exchange one
    currency to purchase another currency. The demand for dollars comes
    from those U.S. export firms seeking to convert their earnings in
    foreign currency back into U.S. dollars; foreign tourists converting
    their earnings in a foreign currency back into U.S. dollars; and
    foreign investors seeking to make financial investments in the U.S.
    economy. On the supply side of the foreign exchange market for the
    trading of U.S. dollars are foreign firms that have sold imports in
    the U.S. economy and are seeking to convert their earnings back to
    their home currency; U.S. tourists abroad; and U.S. investors
    seeking to make financial investments in foreign economies. When
    currency A can buy more of currency B, then currency A has
    strengthened or appreciated relative to B. When currency A can buy
    less of currency B, then currency A has weakened or depreciated
    relative to B. If currency A strengthens or appreciates relative to
    currency B, then currency B must necessarily weaken or depreciate
    with regard to currency A. A stronger currency benefits those who
    are buying with that currency and injures those who are selling. A
    weaker currency injures those, like importers, who are buying with
    that currency and benefits those who are selling with it, like
    exporters.

      

2.  <a href="#bookmark1306" class="a">Demand and Supply Shifts in Foreign Exchange</a>
    [Markets](#bookmark1306)

    In the extreme short run, ranging from a few minutes to a few weeks,
    speculators who are trying to invest in currencies that will grow
    stronger, and to sell currencies that will grow weaker influence
    exchange rates. Such speculation can create a self-fulfilling
    prophecy, at least for a time, where an expected appreciation leads
    to a stronger currency and vice versa. In the relatively short run,
    differences in rates of return influence exchange rate markets.
    Countries with relatively high real rates of return (for example,
    high interest rates) will tend to experience stronger currencies as
    they attract money from abroad, while countries with relatively low
    rates of return will tend to experience weaker exchange rates as
    investors convert to other currencies.

    In the medium run of a few months or a few years, inflation rates
    influence exchange rate markets. Countries with relatively high
    inflation will tend to experience less demand for their currency
    than countries with lower inflation, and thus currency depreciation.
    Over long periods of many years, exchange rates tend to adjust
    toward the purchasing power parity (PPP) rate, which is the exchange
    rate such that the prices of internationally tradable goods in
    different countries, when converted at the PPP exchange rate to a
    common currency, are similar in all economies.

      

3.  <a href="#bookmark1318" class="a">Macroeconomic Effects of Exchange</a>
    [Rates](#bookmark1318)

    A central bank will be concerned about the exchange rate for several
    reasons. Exchange rates will affect imports and exports, and thus
    affect aggregate demand in the economy. Fluctuations in exchange
    rates may cause difficulties for many firms, but especially banks.
    The exchange rate may accompany unsustainable flows of international
    financial capital.

      

4.  <a href="#bookmark1326" class="a">Exchange Rate</a>
    [Policies](#bookmark1326)

In a floating exchange rate policy, a government determines its
country’s exchange rate in the foreign exchange market. In a soft peg
exchange rate policy, the foreign exchange market usually determines a
country's exchange rate, but the government sometimes intervenes to
strengthen or weaken it. In a hard peg exchange rate policy, the
government chooses an exchange rate. A central bank can intervene in
exchange markets in two ways. It can raise or lower interest rates to
make the currency stronger or weaker. It also can directly purchase or
sell its currency in foreign exchange markets. All exchange rates
policies face tradeoffs. A hard peg exchange rate policy will reduce
exchange rate fluctuations, but means that a country must focus its
monetary policy on the exchange rate, not on fighting recession or
controlling inflation. When a nation merges its currency with another
nation, it gives up on nationally oriented monetary policy altogether.

A soft peg exchange rate may create additional volatility as exchange
rate markets try to anticipate when and how the government will
intervene. A flexible exchange rate policy allows monetary policy to
focus on inflation and unemployment, and allows the exchange rate to
change with inflation and rates of return, but also raises a risk that
exchange rates may sometimes make large and abrupt movements. The
spectrum of exchange rate policies includes:

\(a\) a floating exchange rate, (b) a pegged exchange rate, soft or
hard, and (c) a merged currency. Monetary policy can focus on a variety
of goals: (a) inflation; (b) inflation or unemployment, depending on
which is the most dangerous obstacle; and (c) a long-term rule based
policy designed to keep the money supply stable and predictable.

  

SELF-CHECK QUESTIONS

1.  <span id="bookmark1365">How will a stronger euro affect the
    following economic agents?</span>

    1.  A British exporter to Germany.

    2.  A Dutch tourist visiting Chile.

    3.  A Greek bank investing in a Canadian government bond.

    4.  A French exporter to Germany.

2.  <span id="bookmark1366">Suppose that political unrest in Egypt leads
    financial markets to anticipate a depreciation in the Egyptian
    pound. How will that affect the demand for pounds, supply of pounds,
    and exchange rate for pounds compared to, say, U.S. dollars?</span>

3.  <span id="bookmark1367">Suppose U.S. interest rates decline compared
    to the rest of the world. What would be the likely impact on the
    demand for dollars, supply of dollars, and exchange rate for dollars
    compared to, say, euros?</span>

      

4.  <span id="bookmark1368">Suppose Argentina gets inflation under
    control and the Argentine inflation rate decreases substantially.
    What would likely happen to the demand for Argentine pesos, the
    supply of Argentine pesos, and the peso/U.S. dollar exchange
    rate?</span>

5.  <span id="bookmark1369">This chapter has explained that “one of the
    most economically destructive effects of exchange rate fluctuations
    can happen through the banking system,” if banks borrow from abroad
    to lend domestically. Why is this less likely to be a problem for
    the U.S. banking system?</span>

6.  <span id="bookmark1370">A booming economy can attract financial
    capital inflows, which promote further growth. However, capital can
    just as easily flow out of the country, leading to economic
    recession. Is a country whose economy is booming because it decided
    to stimulate consumer spending more or less likely to experience
    capital flight than an economy whose boom is caused by economic
    investment expenditure?</span>

7.  <span id="bookmark1371">How would a contractionary monetary policy
    affect the exchange rate, net exports, aggregate demand, and
    aggregate supply?</span>

8.  <span id="bookmark1372">A central bank can allow its currency to
    fall indefinitely, but it cannot allow its currency to rise
    indefinitely. Why not?</span>

9.  <span id="bookmark1373">Is a country for which imports and exports
    comprise a large fraction of the GDP more likely to adopt a flexible
    exchange rate or a fixed (hard peg) exchange rate?</span>

    CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS

      

    1.  Why would a nation “dollarize”—that is, adopt another country’s
        currency instead of having its own?

    2.  Can you think of any major disadvantages to dollarization? How
        would a central bank work in a country that has dollarized?

    equal, affect the exchange rate of its currency? If so, how?

18. What is the purchasing power parity exchange rate?

19. What are some of the reasons a central bank is likely to care, at
    least to some extent, about the exchange rate?

20. How can an unexpected fall in exchange rates injure the financial
    health of a nation’s banks?

21. What is the difference between a floating exchange rate, a soft peg,
    a hard peg, and dollarization?

22. List some advantages and disadvantages of the different exchange
    rate policies.

  

1.  If a country’s currency is expected to appreciate in value, what
    would you think will be the impact of expected exchange rates on
    yields (e.g., the interest rate paid on government bonds) in that
    country? *Hint*: Think about how expected exchange rate changes and
    interest rates affect a currency's demand and supply.

      

2.  Do you think that a country experiencing hyperinflation is more or
    less likely to have an exchange rate equal to its purchasing power
    parity value when compared to a country with a low inflation rate?

3.  Suppose a country has an overall balance of trade so that exports of
    goods and services equal imports of goods and services. Does that
    imply that the country has balanced trade with *each* of its trading
    partners?

4.  We learned that changes in exchange rates and the corresponding
    changes in the balance of trade amplify monetary policy. From the
    perspective of a nation’s central bank, is this a good thing or a
    bad thing?

5.  If a developing country needs foreign capital inflows, management
    expertise, and technology, how can it encourage foreign investors
    while at the same time protect itself against capital flight and
    banking system collapse, as happened during the Asian financial
    crisis?

6.  Many developing countries, like Mexico, have moderate to high rates
    of inflation. At the same time, international trade plays an
    important role in their economies. What type of exchange rate regime
    would be best for such a country’s currency *vis à vis* the U.S.
    dollar?

7.  What would make a country decide to change from a common currency,
    like the euro, back to its own currency?

      

    PROBLEMS

8.  A British pound cost $2.00 in U.S. dollars in 2008, but $1.27 in
    U.S. dollars in 2017. Was the pound weaker or stronger against the
    dollar? Did the dollar appreciate or depreciate versus the pound?

No Yellowstone Park?

You had trekked all the way to see Yellowstone National Park in the
beautiful month of October 2013, only to find it… closed. Closed! Why?

For two weeks in October 2013, the U.S. federal government shut down.
Many federal services, like the national parks, closed and 800,000
federal employees were furloughed. Tourists were shocked and so was the
rest of the world: Congress and the President could not agree on a
budget. Inside the Capitol, Republicans and Democrats argued about
spending priorities and whether to increase the national debt limit.
Each year's budget, which is over $3 trillion of spending, must be
approved by Congress and signed by the President. Two thirds of the
budget are entitlements and other mandatory spending which occur without
congressional or presidential action once the programs are established.
Tied to the budget debate was the issue of increasing the debt
ceiling—how high the U.S. government's national debt can be. The House
of Representatives refused to sign on to the bills to fund the
government unless they included provisions to stop or change the
Affordable Health Care Act (more colloquially known as Obamacare). As
the days progressed, the United States came very close to defaulting on
its debt.

Why does the federal budget create such intense debates? What would
happen if the United States actually defaulted on its debt? In this
chapter, we will examine the federal budget, taxation, and fiscal
policy. We will also look at the annual federal budget deficits and the
national debt.

#### Introduction to Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy

In this chapter, you will learn about:

-   Government Spending

-   Taxation

-   Federal Deficits and the National Debt

-   Using Fiscal Policy to Fight Recessions, Unemployment, and Inflation

-   Automatic Stabilizers

-   Practical Problems with Discretionary Fiscal Policy

-   The Question of a Balanced Budget

  

All levels of government—federal, state, and local—have budgets that
show how much revenue the government expects to receive in taxes and
other income and how the government plans to spend it. Budgets, however,
can shift dramatically within a few years, as policy decisions and
unexpected events disrupt earlier tax and spending plans.

<a href="#bookmark14" id="bookmark1385" class="s34">In this chapter, we revisit fiscal policy, which we first covered in</a>
<a href="#bookmark14" class="a">Welcome to Economics!</a> <span
class="p">Fiscal policy is one of two policy tools for fine tuning the
economy (the other is monetary policy). While policymakers at the
Federal Reserve make monetary policy, Congress and the President make
fiscal policy.</span>

The discussion of fiscal policy focuses on how federal government taxing
and spending affects aggregate demand. All government spending and taxes
affect the economy, but fiscal policy focuses strictly on federal
government policies. We begin with an overview of U.S. government
spending and taxes. We then discuss fiscal policy from a short-run
perspective; that is, how government uses tax and spending policies to
address recession, unemployment, and inflation; how periods of recession
and growth affect government budgets; and the merits of balanced budget
proposals.

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Identify U.S. budget deficit and surplus trends over the past
        five decades

    -   Explain the differences between the U.S. federal budget, and
        state and local budgets

      

    <span id="bookmark1387">Government spending covers a range of
    services that the federal, state, and local governments provide.
    When the federal government spends more money than it receives in
    taxes in a given year, it runs a</span> **budget deficit**.
    Conversely, when the government receives more money in taxes than it
    spends in a year, it runs a **budget surplus**. If government
    spending and taxes are equal, it has a **balanced budget**. For
    example, in 2009, the U.S. government experienced its largest budget
    deficit ever, as the federal government spent $1.4 trillion more
    than it collected in taxes. This deficit was about 10% of the size
    of the U.S. GDP in 2009, making it by far the largest budget deficit
    relative to GDP since the mammoth borrowing the government used to
    finance World War II.<span id="bookmark1388">‌</span><span
    id="bookmark1389">‌</span>

    This section presents an overview of government spending in the
    United States.

    Total U.S. Government Spending

    Federal spending in nominal dollars (that is, dollars not adjusted
    for inflation) has grown by a multiple of more than 38 over the last
    four decades, from $93.4 billion in 1960 to $3.9 trillion in 2014.
    Comparing spending over time in nominal dollars is misleading
    because it does not take into account inflation or growth in
    population and the real economy. A more useful method of comparison
    is to examine government spending as a percent of GDP over time.

    <a href="#bookmark1390" class="s34">The top line in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1390" class="a">Figure 17.2</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1390" class="s34">shows the federal spending level since 1960, expressed as a share of GDP. Despite a widespread sense among many Americans that the federal government has been growing steadily larger, the graph shows that federal spending has hovered in a range from 18% to 22% of GDP most of the time since 1960. The other lines in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1390" class="a">Figure 17.2</a> <span
    class="p">show the major federal spending categories: national
    defense, Social Security, health</span>

      

      

    programs, and interest payments. From the graph, we see that
    national defense spending as a share of GDP has generally declined
    since the 1960s, although there were some upward bumps in the 1980s
    buildup under President Ronald Reagan and in the aftermath of the
    terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. In contrast, Social
    Security and healthcare have grown steadily as a percent of GDP.
    Healthcare expenditures include both payments for senior citizens
    (Medicare), and payments for low-income Americans (Medicaid). State
    governments also partially fund Medicaid. Interest payments are the
    final main category of government spending in Figure 30.2.

    <span id="bookmark1390">Figure 17.2 Federal Spending,
    1960–2014</span> <span class="s37">Since 1960, total federal
    spending has ranged from about 18% to 22% of GDP, although it
    climbed above that level in 2009, but quickly dropped back down to
    that level by 2013. The share that the government has spent on
    national defense has generally declined, while the share it has
    spent on Social Security and on healthcare expenses (mainly Medicare
    and Medicaid) has increased. (Source: </span><span
    class="s42">Economic Report of the President,
    </span><a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/ERP-2014/content-detail.html)" class="s84">Tables B-2 and B-22, http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/ERP-2014/content-detail.html)</a>

      

    Each year, the government borrows funds from U.S. citizens and
    foreigners to cover its budget deficits. It does this by selling
    securities (Treasury bonds, notes, and bills)—in essence borrowing
    from the public and promising to repay with interest in the future.
    From 1961 to 1997, the U.S. government has run budget deficits, and
    thus borrowed funds, in almost every year. It had budget surpluses
    from 1998 to 2001, and then returned to deficits.

    The interest payments on past federal government borrowing were
    typically 1–2% of GDP in the 1960s and 1970s but then climbed above
    3% of GDP in the 1980s and stayed there until the late 1990s. The
    government was able to repay some of its past borrowing by running
    surpluses from 1998 to 2001 and, with help from low interest rates,
    the interest payments on past federal government borrowing had
    fallen back to 1.4% of GDP by 2012.

    We investigate the government borrowing and debt patterns in more
    detail later in this chapter, but first we need to clarify the
    difference between the deficit and the debt. *The deficit is not the
    debt*. The difference between the deficit and the debt lies in the
    time frame. The government deficit (or surplus) refers to what
    happens with the federal government budget each year. The government
    debt is accumulated over time. It is the sum of all past deficits
    and surpluses. If you borrow $10,000 per year for each of the four
    years of college, you might say that your annual deficit was
    $10,000, but your accumulated debt over the four years is $40,000.

    <a href="#bookmark1391" class="s34">These four categories—national defense, Social Security, healthcare, and interest payments—account for roughly 73% of all federal spending, as</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1391" class="a">Figure 17.3</a> <span
    class="p">shows. The remaining 27% wedge of the pie chart covers all
    other categories of federal government spending: international
    affairs; science and technology; natural resources and the
    environment; transportation; housing; education; income support for
    the poor; community and regional development; law enforcement and
    the judicial system; and the administrative costs of running the
    government.</span>

    State and Local Government Spending

    <a href="#bookmark1392" class="s34">Although federal government spending often gets most of the media attention, state and local government spending is also substantial—at about $3.1 trillion in 2014.</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1392" class="a">Figure 17.4</a> <span
    class="p">shows that state and local government spending has
    increased during the last four decades from around 8% to around 14%
    today. The single biggest item is education, which accounts for
    about one-third of the total. The rest covers programs like
    highways, libraries, hospitals and healthcare, parks, and police and
    fire protection. Unlike the federal government, all states (except
    Vermont) have balanced budget laws, which means any gaps between
    revenues and spending must be closed by higher taxes, lower
    spending, drawing down their previous savings, or some combination
    of all of these.</span>

    K–12 spending and support for public colleges and universities,
    which has been about 4–5% of GDP in recent decades. Source: (Source:
    Bureau of Economic Analysis.)</span>

      

    U.S. presidential candidates often run for office pledging to
    improve the public schools or to get tough on crime. However, in the
    U.S. government system, these tasks are primarily state and local
    government responsibilities. In fiscal year 2014 state and local
    governments spent about $840 billion per year on education
    (including K–12 and college and university education), compared to
    only $100 billion by the federal government, according to
    usgovernmentspending.com. In other words, about 90 cents of every
    dollar spent on education happens at the state and

      

    local level. A politician who really wants hands-on responsibility
    for reforming education or reducing crime might do better to run for
    mayor of a large city or for state governor rather than for
    president of the United States.

      

2.  <span id="bookmark1376">|</span> <span
    style=" color: #3767B1;">Taxation</span><span
    id="bookmark1393">‌</span>

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Differentiate among a regressive tax, a proportional tax, and a
        progressive tax

    -   Identify major revenue sources for the U.S. federal budget

      

    There are two main categories of taxes: those that the federal
    government collects and those that the state and local governments
    collect. What percentage the government collects and for what it
    uses that revenue varies greatly. The following sections will
    briefly explain the taxation system in the United States.

    Federal Taxes

    <a href="#bookmark1394" class="s34">Just as many Americans erroneously think that federal spending has grown considerably, many also believe that taxes have increased substantially. The top line of</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1394" class="a">Figure 17.5</a> <span
    class="p">shows total federal taxes as a share of GDP since 1960.
    Although the line rises and falls, it typically remains within the
    range of 17% to 20% of GDP, except for 2009, when taxes fell
    substantially below this level, due to recession.</span>

      

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_358.jpg" width="434" height="269" alt="image" />

    <span id="bookmark1394"><span class="s36">Figure 17.5 Federal Taxes,
    1960–2014 </span></span>Federal tax revenues have been about 17–20%
    of GDP during most periods in recent decades. The primary sources of
    federal taxes are individual income taxes and the payroll taxes that
    finance Social Security and Medicare. Corporate income taxes and
    social insurance taxes provide smaller shares of revenue. (Source:
    *Economic Report of the President, 2015.*
    <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/cea/" class="s84">Table B-21,</a>

    <a href="#bookmark1394" id="bookmark1395" class="a">Figure 17.5</a><span
    class="s54"> </span>also shows the taxation patterns for the main
    categories that the federal government taxes: individual income
    taxes, corporate income taxes, and social insurance and retirement
    receipts. When most people think of federal government taxes, the
    first tax that comes to mind is the **individual income tax** that
    is due every year on April 15 (or the first business day after). The
    personal income tax is the largest single source of federal
    government revenue, but it still represents less than half of
    federal tax revenue.

    <span id="bookmark1396">The second largest source of federal revenue
    is the</span> **payroll tax** (captured in social insurance and
    retirement receipts), which provides funds for Social Security and
    Medicare. Payroll taxes have increased steadily over time. Together,
    the personal income tax and the payroll tax accounted for about 80%
    of federal tax revenues in 2014. Although personal income tax
    revenues account for more total revenue than the payroll tax, nearly
    three-quarters of households pay more in payroll taxes than in
    income taxes.

    <span id="bookmark1397">The income tax is a</span> **progressive
    tax**, which means that the tax rates increase as a household’s
    income increases. Taxes

      

      

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_359.png" width="624" height="51" alt="image" />

    How does the marginal rate work?

    Suppose that a single taxpayer’s income is $35,000 per year. Also
    suppose that income from $0 to $9,075 is taxed at 10%, income from
    $9,075 to $36,900 is taxed at 15%, and, finally, income from $36,900
    and beyond is taxed at 25%. Since this person earns $35,000, their
    marginal tax rate is 15%.

    <span id="bookmark1398">also vary with marital status, family size,
    and other factors. The</span> **marginal tax rates** (the tax due on
    all yearly income) for a single taxpayer range from 10% to 35%,
    depending on income, as the following Clear It Up feature explains.

      

      

    The key fact here is that the federal income tax is designed so that
    tax rates increase as income increases, up to a certain level. The
    payroll taxes that support Social Security and Medicare are designed
    in a different way. First, the payroll taxes for Social Security are
    imposed at a rate of 12.4% up to a certain wage limit, set at
    $118,500 in 2015. Medicare, on the other hand, pays for elderly
    healthcare, and is fixed at 2.9%, with no upper ceiling.

    In both cases, the employer and the employee split the payroll
    taxes. An employee only sees 6.2% deducted from his or her paycheck
    for Social Security, and 1.45% from Medicare. However, as economists
    are quick to point out, the employer’s half of the taxes are
    probably passed along to the employees in the form of lower wages,
    so in reality, the worker pays all of the payroll taxes.

    <span id="bookmark1399">We also call the Medicare payroll tax
    a</span> **proportional tax**; that is, a flat percentage of all
    wages earned. The Social Security payroll tax is proportional up to
    the wage limit, but above that level it becomes a **regressive
    tax**, meaning that people with higher incomes pay a smaller share
    of their income in tax.<span id="bookmark1400">‌</span>

    <a href="#bookmark1394" id="bookmark1401" class="s34">The third-largest source of federal tax revenue, as</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1394" class="a">Figure 17.5</a><span class="s54">
    </span>shows is the **corporate income tax**. The common name for
    corporate income is “profits.” Over time, corporate income tax
    receipts have declined as a share of GDP, from about 4% in the 1960s
    to an average of 1% to 2% of GDP in the first decade of the 2000s.

    <span id="bookmark1402">The federal government has a few other,
    smaller sources of revenue. It imposes an</span> **excise tax**—that
    is, a tax on a particular good—on gasoline, tobacco, and alcohol. As
    a share of GDP, the amount the government collects from these taxes
    has stayed nearly constant over time, from about 2% of GDP in the
    1960s to roughly 3% by 2014, according to the nonpartisan
    Congressional Budget Office. The government also imposes an **estate
    and gift tax** on people who pass large amounts of assets to the
    next generation—either after death or during life in the form of
    gifts. These estate and gift taxes collected about 0.2% of GDP in
    the first decade of the 2000s. By a quirk of legislation, the
    government repealed the estate and gift tax in 2010, but reinstated
    it in 2011. Other federal taxes, which are also relatively small in
    magnitude, include tariffs the government collects on imported goods
    and charges for inspections of goods entering the country.<span
    id="bookmark1403">‌</span>

    State and Local Taxes

    <a href="#bookmark1404" class="s34">At the state and local level, taxes have been rising as a share of GDP over the last few decades to match the gradual rise in spending, as</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1404" class="a">Figure 17.6</a> <span
    class="p">illustrates. The main revenue sources for state and local
    governments are sales taxes, property taxes, and revenue passed
    along from the federal government, but many state and local
    governments also levy personal and corporate income taxes, as well
    as impose a wide variety of fees and charges. The specific sources
    of tax revenue vary widely across state and local governments. Some
    states rely more on property taxes, some on sales taxes, some on
    income taxes, and some more on revenues from the federal
    government.</span>

    style=" color: #3767B1;">Federal Deficits and the National
    Debt</span><span id="bookmark1405">‌</span>

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Explain the U.S. federal budget in terms of annual debt and
        accumulated debt

    -   Understand how economic growth or decline can influence a budget
        surplus or budget deficit

      

    <span id="bookmark1406">Having discussed the revenue (taxes) and
    expense (spending) side of the budget, we now turn to the annual
    budget deficit or surplus, which is the difference between the tax
    revenue collected and spending over a fiscal year, which starts
    October 1 and ends September 30 of the next year.</span>

    <a href="#bookmark1407" class="a">Figure 17.7</a> <span
    class="p">shows the pattern of annual federal budget deficits and
    surpluses, back to 1930, as a share of GDP. When the line is above
    the horizontal axis, the budget is in surplus. When the line is
    below the horizontal axis, a budget deficit occurred. Clearly, the
    biggest deficits as a share of GDP during this time were incurred to
    finance World War</span>

    II\. Deficits were also large during the 1930s, the 1980s, the early
    1990s, and most recently during the 2008-2009 recession.

    Debt/GDP Ratio

    <span id="bookmark1408">Another useful way to view the budget
    deficit is through the prism of accumulated debt rather than annual
    deficits. The</span> **national debt**
    <a href="#bookmark1409" class="s34">refers to the total amount that the government has borrowed over time. In contrast, the budget deficit refers to how much the government has borrowed in one particular year.</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1409" class="a">Figure 17.8</a><span class="s54">
    </span>shows the ratio of debt/GDP since 1940. Until the 1970s, the

    The government ran up large deficits and raised the debt/GDP ratio
    in World War II, but from the 1950s to the 1970s the government ran
    either surpluses or relatively small deficits, and so the debt/GDP
    ratio drifted down. Large deficits in the 1980s and early 1990s
    caused the ratio to rise sharply. When budget surpluses arrived from
    1998 to 2001, the debt/ GDP ratio declined substantially. The budget
    deficits starting in 2002 then tugged the debt/GDP ratio higher—with
    a big jump when the recession took hold in 2008–2009.

    What is the national debt?

    One year’s federal budget deficit causes the federal government to
    sell Treasury bonds to make up the difference between spending
    programs and tax revenues. The dollar value of all the outstanding
    Treasury bonds on which the federal government owes money is equal
    to the national debt.

    The next Clear it Up feature discusses how the government handles
    the national debt.

      

      

    The Path from Deficits to Surpluses to Deficits

    <a href="#bookmark1410" class="s34">Why did the budget deficits suddenly turn to surpluses from 1998 to 2001 and why did the surpluses return to deficits in 2002? Why did the deficit become so large after 2007?</a>

    Government Spending and Taxes as a Share of GDP, 1990–2014
    </span></span>When government spending exceeds taxes, the gap is the
    budget deficit. When taxes exceed spending, the gap is a budget
    surplus. The recessionary period starting in late 2007 saw higher
    spending and lower taxes, combining to create a large deficit
    in 2009. (Source: [Economic Report of the President, Tables B-21 and
    B-1,](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/ERP-2015/)"http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/ERP-2015/
    content-detail.html)

      

    Government spending as a share of GDP declined steadily through the
    1990s. The biggest single reason was that defense spending declined
    from 5.2% of GDP in 1990 to 3.0% in 2000, but interest payments by
    the federal government also fell by about 1.0% of GDP. However,
    federal tax collections increased substantially in the later 1990s,
    jumping from 18.1% of GDP in 1994 to 20.8% in 2000. Powerful
    economic growth in the late 1990s fueled the boom in taxes. Personal
    income taxes rise as income goes up; payroll taxes rise as jobs and
    payrolls go up; corporate income taxes rise as profits go up. At the
    same time, government spending on transfer payments such as
    unemployment benefits, foods stamps, and welfare declined with more
    people working.

    This sharp increase in tax revenues and decrease in expenditures on
    transfer payments was largely unexpected even by experienced budget
    analysts, and so budget surpluses came as a surprise. However, in
    the early 2000s, many of these factors started running in reverse.
    Tax revenues sagged, due largely to the recession that started in
    March 2001, which reduced revenues. Congress enacted a series of tax
    cuts and President George W. Bush signed them into law, starting
    in 2001. In addition, government spending swelled due to increases
    in defense, healthcare, education, Social Security, and support
    programs for those who were hurt by the recession and the slow
    growth that followed. Deficits returned. When the severe recession
    hit in late 2007, spending climbed and tax collections fell to
    historically unusual levels, resulting in enormous deficits.

    Longer-term U.S. budget forecasts, a decade or more into the future,
    predict enormous deficits. The higher deficits during the 2008-2009
    recession have repercussions, and the demographics will be
    challenging. The primary reason is the “baby boom”—the exceptionally
    high birthrates that began in 1946, right after World War II, and
    lasted for about two decades. Starting in 2010, the front edge of
    the baby boom generation began to reach age 65, and in the next two
    decades, the proportion of Americans over the age of 65 will
    increase substantially. The current level of the payroll taxes that
    support Social Security and Medicare will fall well short of the
    projected expenses of these programs, as the following Clear It Up
    feature shows; thus, the forecast is for large budget deficits. A
    decision to collect more revenue to support these programs or to
    decrease benefit levels would alter this long-term forecast.

      

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_365.png" width="624" height="477" alt="image" />

    What is the long-term budget outlook for Social Security and
    Medicare?

    In 1946, just one American in 13 was over age 65. By 2000, it was
    one in eight. By 2030, one American in five will be over age 65. Two
    enormous U.S. federal programs focus on the elderly—Social Security
    and Medicare. The growing numbers of elderly Americans will increase
    spending on these programs, as well as on Medicaid. The current
    payroll tax levied on workers, which supports all of Social Security
    and the hospitalization insurance part of Medicare, will not be
    enough to cover the expected costs, so what are the options?

    Long-term projections from the Congressional Budget Office in 2009
    are that Medicare and Social Security spending combined will rise
    from 8.3% of GDP in 2009 to about 13% by 2035 and about 20% in 2080.
    If this rise in spending occurs, without any corresponding rise in
    tax collections, then some mix of changes must occur: (1) taxes will
    need to increase dramatically; (2) other spending will need to be
    cut dramatically; (3) the retirement age and/or age receiving
    Medicare benefits will need to increase, or (4) the federal
    government will need to run extremely large budget deficits.

    Some proposals suggest removing the cap on wages subject to the
    payroll tax, so that those with very high incomes would have to pay
    the tax on the entire amount of their wages. Other proposals suggest
    moving Social Security and Medicare from systems in which workers
    pay for retirees toward programs that set up accounts where workers
    save funds over their lifetimes and then draw out after retirement
    to pay for healthcare.

    The United States is not alone in this problem. Providing the
    promised level of retirement and health benefits to a growing
    proportion of elderly with a falling proportion of workers is an
    even more severe problem in many European nations and in Japan. How
    to pay promised levels of benefits to the elderly will be a
    difficult public policy decision.

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

<span id="bookmark1412">Fiscal policy is the use of government spending

**contractionary fiscal
policy**<a href="#bookmark1415" class="s34">. We know from the chapter on economic growth that over time the quantity and quality of our resources grow as the population and thus the labor force get larger, as businesses invest in new capital, and as technology improves. The result of this is regular shifts to the right of the aggregate supply curves, as</a>
<a href="#bookmark1415" class="a">Figure 17.10</a><span class="s54">

One year later, aggregate supply has shifted to the right to SRAS<span
class="s60">1</span> in the process of long-term economic growth, and
aggregate demand has also shifted to the right to AD<span
class="s60">1</span>, keeping the economy operating at the new level of
potential GDP. The new equilibrium (E<span class="s60">1</span>) is an
output level of

  

  

206 and a price level of 92. One more year later, aggregate supply has
again shifted to the right, now to SRAS<span class="s60">2</span>, and
aggregate demand shifts right as well to AD<span class="s60">2</span>.
Now the equilibrium is E<span class="s60">2</span>, with an output level
of 212 and a price level of 94. In short, the figure shows an economy
that is growing steadily year to year, producing at its potential GDP
each year, with only small inflationary increases in the price level.

  

<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_366.jpg" width="301" height="243" alt="image" />

<span id="bookmark1415"><span class="s36">Figure 17.10 A Healthy,
Growing Economy </span></span>In this well-functioning economy, each
year aggregate supply and aggregate demand shift to the right so that
the economy proceeds from equilibrium E<span class="s63">0</span> to
E<span class="s63">1</span> to E<span class="s63">2</span>. Each year,
the economy produces at potential GDP with only a small inflationary
increase in the price level. However, if aggregate demand does not
smoothly shift to the right and match increases in aggregate supply,
growth with deflation can develop.

  

<a href="#bookmark1415" class="s34">Aggregate demand and aggregate supply do not always move neatly together. Think about what causes shifts in aggregate demand over time. As aggregate supply increases, incomes tend to go up. This tends to increase consumer and investment spending, shifting the aggregate demand curve to the right, but in any given period it may not shift the same amount as aggregate supply. What happens to government spending and taxes? Government spends to pay for the ordinary business of government- items such as national defense, social security, and healthcare, as</a>
[Figure](#bookmark1415)

17.10 <span class="p">shows. Tax revenues, in part, pay for these
expenditures. The result may be an increase in aggregate demand more
than or less than the increase in aggregate supply. Aggregate demand may
fail to increase along with aggregate supply, or aggregate demand may
even shift left, for a number of possible reasons: households become
hesitant about consuming; firms decide against investing as much; or
perhaps the demand from other countries for exports diminishes.</span>

For example, investment by private firms in physical capital in the U.S.
economy boomed during the late 1990s, rising from 14.1% of GDP in 1993
to 17.2% in 2000, before falling back to 15.2% by 2002. Conversely, if
shifts in aggregate demand run ahead of increases in aggregate supply,
inflationary increases in the price level will result. Business cycles
of recession and recovery are the consequence of shifts in aggregate
supply and aggregate demand. As these occur, the government may choose
to use fiscal policy to address the difference.

<a href="#bookmark1177" class="a">Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation</a>
<span class="p">shows us that a central bank can use its powers over the
banking system to engage in countercyclical—or “against the business
cycle”—actions. If recession threatens, the central bank uses an
expansionary monetary policy to increase the money supply, increase the
quantity of loans, reduce interest rates, and shift aggregate demand to
the right. If inflation threatens, the central bank uses contractionary
monetary policy to reduce the money supply, reduce the quantity of
loans, raise interest rates, and shift aggregate demand to the left.
Fiscal policy is another macroeconomic policy tool for adjusting
aggregate demand by using either government spending or taxation
policy.</span>

Expansionary Fiscal Policy

Expansionary fiscal policy increases the level of aggregate demand,
through either increases in government spending or reductions in tax
rates. Expansionary policy can do this by (1) increasing consumption by
raising disposable income through cuts in personal income taxes or
payroll taxes; (2) increasing investment spending by raising after-tax
profits through cuts in business taxes; and (3) increasing government
purchases through increased federal government

  

  

spending on final goods and services and raising federal grants to state
and local governments to increase their expenditures on final goods and
services. Contractionary fiscal policy does the reverse: it decreases
the level of aggregate demand by decreasing consumption, decreasing
investment, and decreasing government spending, either through cuts in
government spending or increases in taxes. The aggregate
demand/aggregate supply model is useful in judging whether expansionary
or contractionary fiscal policy is appropriate.

<a href="#bookmark1416" class="s34">Consider first the situation in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1416" class="a">Figure</a> <span
class="s54">17.11</span>, which is similar to the U.S. economy during

class="s60">0</span>) is occurring below the level of potential GDP as
the LRAS curve indicates. At the equilibrium (E<span
class="s60">0</span>), a recession occurs and unemployment rises. In
this case, expansionary fiscal policy using tax cuts or increases in
government spending can shift aggregate demand to AD<span
class="s60">1</span>, closer to the full-employment level of output. In
addition, the price level would rise back to the level P<span
class="s60">1</span> associated with potential GDP.

  

<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_367.jpg" width="299" height="250" alt="image" />

<span id="bookmark1416"><span class="s36">Figure 17.11 Expansionary
Fiscal Policy </span></span>The original equilibrium (E<span
class="s63">0</span>) represents a recession, occurring at a quantity of
output (Y<span class="s63">0</span>) below potential GDP. However, a
shift of aggregate demand from AD<span class="s63">0</span> to AD<span
class="s63">1</span>, enacted through an expansionary fiscal policy, can
move the economy to a new equilibrium output of E<span
class="s63">1</span> at the level of potential GDP which the LRAS curve
shows. Since the economy was originally producing below potential GDP,
any inflationary increase in the price level from P<span
class="s63">0</span> to P<span class="s63">1</span> that results should
be relatively small.

  

Should the government use tax cuts or spending increases, or a mix of
the two, to carry out expansionary fiscal policy? During the 2008-2009
Great Recession (which started, actually, in late 2007), the U.S.
economy suffered a 3.1% cumulative loss of GDP. That may not sound like
much, but it’s more than one year’s average growth rate of GDP. Over
that time frame, the unemployment rate doubled from 5% to 10%. The
consensus view is that this was possibly the worst economic downturn in
U.S. history since the 1930’s Great Depression. The choice between
whether to use tax or spending tools often has a political tinge. As a
general statement, conservatives and Republicans prefer to see
expansionary fiscal policy carried out by tax cuts, while liberals and
Democrats prefer that the government implement expansionary fiscal
policy through spending increases. In a bipartisan effort to address the
extreme situation, the Obama administration and Congress passed an $830
billion expansionary policy in early 2009 involving both tax cuts and
increases in government spending. At the same time, however, the federal
stimulus was partially offset when state and local governments, whose
budgets were hard hit by the recession, began cutting their spending.

The conflict over which policy tool to use can be frustrating to those
who want to categorize economics as “liberal” or “conservative,” or who
want to use economic models to argue against their political opponents.
However, advocates of smaller government, who seek to reduce taxes and
government spending can use the AD AS model, as well as advocates of
bigger government, who seek to raise taxes and government spending.
Economic studies of specific taxing and spending programs can help
inform decisions about whether the government should change taxes or
spending, and in what ways. Ultimately, decisions about whether to use
tax or spending mechanisms to implement macroeconomic policy is a
political decision rather than a purely economic one.

Contractionary Fiscal Policy

Fiscal policy can also contribute to pushing aggregate demand beyond
potential GDP in a way that leads to inflation.

  

  

<a href="#bookmark1417" class="s34">As</a>
<a href="#bookmark1417" class="a">Figure 17.12</a><span class="s54">
</span>shows, a very large budget deficit pushes up aggregate demand, so
that the intersection of aggregate demand (AD<span class="s60">0</span>)
and aggregate supply (SRAS<span class="s60">0</span>) occurs at
equilibrium E<span class="s60">0</span>, which is an output level above
potential GDP. Economists sometimes call this an “overheating economy”
where demand is so high that there is upward pressure on wages and
prices, causing inflation. In this situation, contractionary fiscal
policy involving federal spending cuts or tax increases can help to
reduce the upward pressure on the price level by shifting aggregate
demand to the left, to AD<span class="s60">1</span>, and causing the new
equilibrium E<span class="s60">1</span> to be at potential GDP, where
aggregate demand intersects the LRAS curve.

  

  

<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_368.jpg" width="300" height="256" alt="image" />

<span id="bookmark1417"><span class="s36">Figure 17.12 A Contractionary
Fiscal Policy </span></span>The economy starts at the equilibrium
quantity of output Y<span class="s63">0</span>, which is above potential
GDP. The extremely high level of aggregate demand will generate
inflationary increases in the price level. A contractionary fiscal
policy can shift aggregate demand down from AD<span class="s63">0</span>
to AD<span class="s63">1</span>, leading to a new equilibrium output
E<span class="s63">1</span>, which occurs at potential GDP, where AD1
intersects the LRAS curve.

  

Again, the AD–AS model does not dictate how the government should carry
out this contractionary fiscal policy. Some may prefer spending cuts;
others may prefer tax increases; still others may say that it depends on
the specific situation. The model only argues that, in this situation,
the government needs to reduce aggregate demand.

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Describe how the federal government can use discretionary fiscal
        policy to stabilize the economy

    -   Identify examples of automatic stabilizers

    -   Understand how a government can use standardized employment
        budget to identify automatic stabilizers

      

    <span id="bookmark1419">The millions of unemployed in 2008–2009
    could collect unemployment insurance benefits to replace some of
    their salaries. Federal fiscal policies include</span>
    **discretionary fiscal policy**, when the government passes a new
    law that explicitly changes tax or spending levels. The 2009
    stimulus package is an example. Changes in tax and spending levels
    can also occur automatically, due to **automatic stabilizers**, such
    as unemployment insurance and food stamps, which are programs that
    are already laws that stimulate aggregate demand in a recession and
    hold down aggregate demand in a potentially inflationary boom.<span
    id="bookmark1420">‌</span>

    Counterbalancing Recession and Boom

    Consider first the situation where aggregate demand has risen
    sharply, causing the equilibrium to occur at a level of output above
    potential GDP. This situation will increase inflationary pressure in
    the economy. The policy prescription in this setting would be a dose
    of contractionary fiscal policy, implemented through some
    combination of higher taxes and lower spending. To some extent,
    *both* changes happen automatically. On the tax side, a rise in
    aggregate demand means that workers and firms throughout the economy
    earn more. Because taxes are based on personal income and

      

      

    corporate profits, a rise in aggregate demand automatically
    increases tax payments. On the spending side, stronger aggregate
    demand typically means lower unemployment and fewer layoffs, and so
    there is less need for government spending on unemployment benefits,
    welfare, Medicaid, and other programs in the social safety net.

    The process works in reverse, too. If aggregate demand were to fall
    sharply so that a recession occurs, then the prescription would be
    for expansionary fiscal policy—some mix of tax cuts and spending
    increases. The lower level of aggregate demand and higher
    unemployment will tend to pull down personal incomes and corporate
    profits, an effect that will reduce the amount of taxes owed
    automatically. Higher unemployment and a weaker economy should lead
    to increased government spending on unemployment benefits, welfare,
    and other similar domestic programs. In 2009, the stimulus package
    included an extension in the time allowed to collect unemployment
    insurance. In addition, the automatic stabilizers react to a
    weakening of aggregate demand with expansionary fiscal policy and
    react to a strengthening of aggregate demand with contractionary
    fiscal policy, just as the AD/AS analysis suggests.

    A combination of automatic stabilizers and discretionary fiscal
    policy produced the very large budget deficit in 2009. The Great
    Recession, starting in late 2007, meant less tax-generating economic
    activity, which triggered the automatic stabilizers that reduce
    taxes. Most economists, even those who are concerned about a
    possible pattern of persistently large budget deficits, are much
    less concerned or even quite supportive of larger budget deficits in
    the short run of a few years during and immediately after a severe
    recession.

    <a href="#bookmark619" class="s34">A glance back at economic history provides a second illustration of the power of automatic stabilizers. Remember that the length of economic upswings between recessions has become longer in the U.S. economy in recent decades (as we discussed in</a>
    Unemployment<span class="p">). The three longest economic booms of
    the twentieth century happened in the 1960s, the 1980s, and the
    1991–2001 time period. One reason why the economy has tipped into
    recession less frequently in recent decades is that the size of
    government spending and taxes has increased in the second half of
    the twentieth century. Thus, the automatic stabilizing effects from
    spending and taxes are now larger than they were in the first half
    of the twentieth century. Around 1900, for example, federal spending
    was only about 2% of GDP. In 1929, just before the Great Depression
    hit, government spending was still just 4% of GDP. In those earlier
    times, the smaller size of government made automatic stabilizers far
    less powerful than in the last few decades, when government spending
    often hovers at 20% of GDP or more.</span>

    Notice that in recession years, like the early 1990s, 2001, or 2009,
    the standardized employment deficit is smaller than the actual
    deficit. During recessions, the automatic stabilizers tend to
    increase the budget deficit, so if the economy was instead at full
    employment, the deficit would be reduced. However, in the late 1990s
    the standardized employment budget surplus was lower than the actual
    budget surplus. The gap between the standardized budget deficit or
    surplus and the actual budget deficit or surplus shows the impact of
    the automatic stabilizers. More generally, the standardized budget
    figures allow you to see what the budget deficit would look like
    with the economy held constant—at its potential GDP level of output.

    Automatic stabilizers occur quickly. Lower wages means that a lower
    amount of taxes is withheld from paychecks right away. Higher
    unemployment or poverty means that government spending in those
    areas rises as quickly as people apply for benefits. However, while
    the automatic stabilizers offset part of the shifts in aggregate
    demand, they do not offset all or even most of it. Historically,
    automatic stabilizers on the tax and spending side offset about 10%
    of any initial movement in the level of output. This offset may not
    seem enormous, but it is still useful. Automatic stabilizers, like
    shock absorbers in a car, can be useful if they reduce the impact of
    the worst bumps, even if they do not eliminate the bumps altogether.

    Fiscal Policy</span><span id="bookmark1423">‌</span>

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Understand how fiscal policy and monetary policy are
        interconnected

    -   Explain the three lag times that often occur when solving
        economic problems

    -   Identify the legal and political challenges of responding to an
        economic problem

          

        <span id="bookmark1424">In the early 1960s, many leading
        economists believed that the problem of the business cycle, and
        the swings between cyclical unemployment and inflation, were a
        thing of the past. On the cover of its December 31, 1965,
        issue,</span> *Time* magazine, then the premier news magazine in
        the United States, ran a picture of John Maynard Keynes, and the
        story inside identified Keynesian theories as “the prime
        influence on the world’s economies.” The article reported that
        policymakers have “used Keynesian principles not only to avoid
        the violent \[business\] cycles of prewar days but to produce
        phenomenal economic growth and to achieve remarkably stable
        prices.”

        This happy consensus, however, did not last. The U.S. economy
        suffered one recession from December 1969 to November 1970, a
        deeper recession from November 1973 to March 1975, and then
        double-dip recessions from

          

          

        January to June 1980 and from July 1981 to November 1982. At
        various times, inflation and unemployment both soared. Clearly,
        the problems of macroeconomic policy had not been completely
        solved. As economists began to consider what had gone wrong,
        they identified a number of issues that make discretionary
        fiscal policy more difficult than it had seemed in the rosy
        optimism of the mid-1960s.

        Fiscal Policy and Interest Rates

        <a href="#bookmark1426" id="bookmark1425" class="s34">Because fiscal policy affects the quantity that the government borrows in financial capital markets, it not only affects aggregate demand—it can also affect interest rates. In</a>
        <a href="#bookmark1426" class="a">Figure</a> <span
        class="s54">17.14</span>, the original equilibrium (E<span
        class="s60">0</span>) in the financial capital market occurs at
        a quantity of $800 billion and an interest rate of 6%. However,
        an increase in government budget deficits shifts the demand for
        financial capital from D<span class="s60">0</span> to D<span
        class="s60">1</span>. The new equilibrium (E<span
        class="s60">1</span>) occurs at a quantity of $900 billion and
        an interest rate of 7%.

        A consensus estimate based on a number of studies is that an
        increase in budget deficits (or a fall in budget surplus) by 1%
        of GDP will cause an increase of 0.5–1.0% in the long-term
        interest rate.

          

          

        <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_371.jpg" width="301" height="256" alt="image" />

        <span id="bookmark1426"><span class="s36">Figure 17.14 Fiscal
        Policy and Interest Rates </span></span>When a government
        borrows money in the financial capital market, it causes a shift
        in the demand for financial capital from D<span
        class="s63">0</span> to D<span class="s63">1</span>. As the
        equilibrium moves from E<span class="s63">0</span> to E<span
        class="s63">1</span>, the equilibrium interest rate rises from
        6% to 7% in this example. In this way, an expansionary fiscal
        policy intended to shift aggregate demand to the right can also
        lead to a higher interest rate, which has the effect of shifting
        aggregate demand back to the left.

          

        <span id="bookmark1427">A problem arises here. An expansionary
        fiscal policy, with tax cuts or spending increases, is intended
        to increase aggregate demand. If an expansionary fiscal policy
        also causes higher interest rates, then firms and households are
        discouraged from borrowing and spending (as occurs with tight
        monetary policy), thus reducing aggregate demand. Even if the
        direct effect of expansionary fiscal policy on increasing demand
        is not totally offset by lower aggregate demand from higher
        interest rates, fiscal policy can end up less powerful than was
        originally expected. We refer to this as</span> **crowding
        out**, where government borrowing and spending results in higher
        interest rates, which reduces business investment and household
        consumption.

        The broader lesson is that the government must coordinate fiscal
        and monetary policy. If expansionary fiscal policy is to work
        well, then the central bank can also reduce or keep short-term
        interest rates low. Conversely, monetary policy can also help to
        ensure that contractionary fiscal policy does not lead to a
        recession.

        Long and Variable Time Lags

        <span id="bookmark1428">The government can change monetary
        policy several times each year, but it takes much longer to
        enact fiscal policy. Imagine that the economy starts to slow
        down. It often takes some months before the economic statistics
        signal clearly that a downturn has started, and a few months
        more to confirm that it is truly a recession and not just a one-
        or two-month blip. Economists often call the time it takes to
        determine that a recession has occurred the</span> **recognition
        lag**. After this lag, policymakers become aware of the problem
        and propose fiscal policy bills. The bills go into various
        congressional committees for hearings, negotiations, votes, and
        then, if passed, eventually for the president’s

          

          

        <span id="bookmark1429">signature. Many fiscal policy bills
        about spending or taxes propose changes that would start in the
        next budget year or would be phased in gradually over time.
        Economists often refer to the time it takes to pass a bill as
        the</span> **legislative lag**. Finally, once the government
        passes the bill it takes some time to disperse the funds to the
        appropriate agencies to implement the programs. Economists call
        the time it takes to start the projects the **implementation
        lag**.<span id="bookmark1430">‌</span>

        Moreover, the exact level of fiscal policy that the government
        should implement is never completely clear. Should it increase
        the budget deficit by 0.5% of GDP? By 1% of GDP? By 2% of GDP?
        In an AD/AS diagram, it is straightforward to sketch an
        aggregate demand curve shifting to the potential GDP level of
        output. In the real world, we only know roughly, not precisely,
        the actual level of potential output, and exactly how a spending
        cut or tax increase will affect aggregate demand is always
        somewhat controversial. Also unknown is the state of the economy
        at any point in time. During the early days of the Obama
        administration, for example, no one knew the true extent of the
        economy's deficit. During the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the
        rapid collapse of the banking system and automotive sector made
        it difficult to assess how quickly the economy was collapsing.

        Thus, it can take many months or even more than a year to begin
        an expansionary fiscal policy after a recession has started—and
        even then, uncertainty will remain over exactly how much to
        expand or contract taxes and spending. When politicians attempt
        to use countercyclical fiscal policy to fight recession or
        inflation, they run the risk of responding to the macroeconomic
        situation of two or three years ago, in a way that may be
        exactly wrong for the economy at that time. George P. Schultz, a
        professor of economics, former Secretary of the Treasury, and
        Director of the Office of Management and Budget, once wrote:
        “While the economist is accustomed to the concept of lags, the
        politician likes instant results. The tension comes because, as
        I have seen on many occasions, the economist’s lag is the
        politician’s nightmare.”

        Temporary and Permanent Fiscal Policy

        A temporary tax cut or spending increase will explicitly last
        only for a year or two, and then revert to its original level. A
        permanent tax cut or spending increase is expected to stay in
        place for the foreseeable future. The effect of temporary and
        permanent fiscal policies on aggregate demand can be very
        different. Consider how you would react if the government
        announced a tax cut that would last one year and then be
        repealed, in comparison with how you would react if the
        government announced a permanent tax cut. Most people and firms
        will react more strongly to a permanent policy change than a
        temporary one.

        This fact creates an unavoidable difficulty for countercyclical
        fiscal policy. The appropriate policy may be to have an
        expansionary fiscal policy with large budget deficits during a
        recession, and then a contractionary fiscal policy with budget
        surpluses when the economy is growing well. However, if both
        policies are explicitly temporary ones, they will have a less
        powerful effect than a permanent policy.

        Structural Economic Change Takes Time

        <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_372.png" width="624" height="51" alt="image" />

        <a href="#bookmark1177" class="s34">When an economy recovers from a recession, it does not usually revert to its exact earlier shape. Instead, the economy's internal structure evolves and changes and this process can take time. For example, much of the economic growth of the mid-2000s was in the construction sector (especially of housing) and finance. However, when housing prices started falling in 2007 and the resulting financial crunch led into recession (as we discussed in</a>
        <a href="#bookmark1177" class="a">Monetary Policy and Bank</a>
        Regulation<span class="p">), both sectors contracted. The
        manufacturing sector of the U.S. economy has been losing jobs in
        recent years as well, under pressure from technological change
        and foreign competition. Many of the people who lost work from
        these sectors in the 2008-2009 Great Recession will never return
        to the same jobs in the same sectors of the economy. Instead,
        the economy will need to grow in new and different directions,
        as the following Clear It Up feature shows. Fiscal policy can
        increase overall demand, but the process of structural economic
        change—the expansion of a new set of industries and the movement
        of workers to those industries—inevitably takes time.</span>

          

        Why do jobs vanish?

        People can lose jobs for a variety of reasons: because of a
        recession, but also because of longer-run changes in the
        economy, such as new technology. Productivity improvements in
        auto manufacturing, for example, can

          

        reduce the number of workers needed, and eliminate these jobs in
        the long run. The internet has created jobs but also caused job
        loss, from travel agents to book store clerks. Many of these
        jobs may never come back. Short-run fiscal policy to reduce
        unemployment can create jobs, but it cannot replace jobs that
        will never return.

          

        The Limitations of Fiscal Policy

        <span style=" color: #000;">to read about how fiscal policies
        are affecting the recovery.</span>

        Fiscal policy can help an economy that is producing below its
        potential GDP to expand aggregate demand so that it produces
        closer to potential GDP, thus lowering unemployment. However,
        fiscal policy cannot help an economy produce at an output level
        above potential GDP without causing inflation At this point,
        unemployment becomes so low that workers become scarce and wages
        rise rapidly.

          

          

        Political Realties and Discretionary Fiscal Policy

        A final problem for discretionary fiscal policy arises out of
        the difficulties of explaining to politicians how
        countercyclical fiscal policy that runs against the tide of the
        business cycle should work. Some politicians have a gut- level
        belief that when the economy and tax revenues slow down, it is
        time to hunker down, pinch pennies, and trim expenses.
        Countercyclical policy, however, says that when the economy has
        slowed, it is time for the government to stimulate the economy,
        raising spending, and cutting taxes. This offsets the drop in
        the economy in the other sectors. Conversely, when economic
        times are good and tax revenues are rolling in, politicians
        often feel that it is time for tax cuts and new spending.
        However, countercyclical policy says that this economic boom
        should be an appropriate time for keeping taxes high and
        restraining spending.

        Politicians tend to prefer expansionary fiscal policy over
        contractionary policy. There is rarely a shortage of proposals
        for tax cuts and spending increases, especially during
        recessions. However, politicians are less willing to hear the
        message that in good economic times, they should propose tax
        increases and spending limits. In the economic upswing of the
        late 1990s and early 2000s, for example, the U.S. GDP grew
        rapidly. Estimates from respected government economic
        forecasters like the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and
        the Office of Management and Budget stated that the GDP was
        above potential GDP, and that unemployment rates were
        unsustainably low. However, no mainstream politician took the
        lead in saying that the booming economic times might be an
        appropriate time for spending cuts or tax increases. As of
        February 2017, President Trump has expressed plans to increase
        spending on national defense by 10% or $54 billion, increase
        infrastructure investment by $1 trillion, cut corporate and
        personal income taxes, all while maintaining the existing
        spending on Social Security and Medicare. The only way this math
        adds up is with a sizeable increase in the Federal budget
        deficit.

        Discretionary Fiscal Policy: Summing Up

        Expansionary fiscal policy can help to end recessions and
        contractionary fiscal policy can help to reduce inflation. Given
        the uncertainties over interest rate effects, time lags,
        temporary and permanent policies, and unpredictable political
        behavior, many economists and knowledgeable policymakers had
        concluded by the mid-1990s that discretionary fiscal policy was
        a blunt instrument, more like a club than a scalpel. It might
        still make sense to use

          

          

        it in extreme economic situations, like an especially deep or
        long recession. For less extreme situations, it was often
        preferable to let fiscal policy work through the automatic
        stabilizers and focus on monetary policy to steer short-term
        countercyclical efforts.

          

3.  <span id="bookmark1381">|</span> <span style=" color: #3767B1;">The
    Question of a Balanced Budget</span><span id="bookmark1431">‌</span>

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Understand the arguments for and against requiring the U.S.
        federal budget to be balanced

    -   Consider the long-run and short-run effects of a federal budget
        deficit

  

For many decades, going back to the 1930s, various legislators have put
forward proposals to require that the

U.S. government balance its budget every year. In 1995, a proposed
constitutional amendment that would require a balanced budget passed the
U.S. House of Representatives by a wide margin, and failed in the U.S.
Senate by only a single vote. (For the balanced budget to have become an
amendment to the Constitution would have required a two- thirds vote by
Congress and passage by three-quarters of the state legislatures.)

<span id="bookmark1432">Most economists view the proposals for a
perpetually balanced budget with bemusement. After all, in the short
term, economists would expect the budget deficits and surpluses to
fluctuate up and down with the economy and the automatic stabilizers.
Economic recessions should automatically lead to larger budget deficits
or smaller budget surpluses, while economic booms lead to smaller
deficits or larger surpluses. A requirement that the budget be balanced
each and every year would prevent these automatic stabilizers from
working and would worsen the severity of economic fluctuations.</span>

<span id="bookmark1433">Some supporters of the balanced budget amendment
like to argue that, since households must balance their own budgets, the
government should too. However, this analogy between household and
government behavior is severely flawed. Most households do not balance
their budgets every year. Some years households borrow to buy houses or
cars or to pay for medical expenses or college tuition. Other years they
repay loans and save funds in retirement accounts. After retirement,
they withdraw and spend those savings. Also, the government is not a
household for many reasons, one of which is that the government has
macroeconomic responsibilities. The argument of Keynesian macroeconomic
policy is that the government needs to lean against the wind, spending
when times are hard and saving when times are good, for the sake of the
overall economy.</span>

<span id="bookmark1434">There is also no particular reason to expect a
government budget to be balanced in the medium term of a few years. For
example, a government may decide that by running large budget deficits,
it can make crucial long-term investments in human capital and physical
infrastructure that will build the country's long-term productivity.
These decisions may work out well or poorly, but they are not always
irrational. Such policies of ongoing government budget deficits may
persist for decades. As the U.S. experience from the end of World War II
up to about 1980 shows, it is perfectly possible to run budget deficits
almost every year for decades, but as long as the percentage increases
in debt are smaller than the percentage growth of GDP, the debt/GDP
ratio will decline at the same time.</span>

No Yellowstone Park?

The 2013 federal budget shutdown illustrated the many sides to fiscal
policy and the federal budget. In 2013, Republicans and Democrats could
not agree on which spending policies to fund and how large the
government debt should be. Due to the severity of the 2008-2009
recession, the fiscal stimulus, and previous

<a href="#bookmark1483" class="s34">Nothing in this argument is a claim that budget deficits are always a wise policy. In the short run, a government that runs a very large budget deficit can shift aggregate demand to the right and trigger severe inflation. Additionally, governments may borrow for foolish or impractical reasons.</a>
<a href="#bookmark1483" class="a">The Impacts of Government Borrowing</a>
<span class="p">will discuss how large budget deficits, by reducing
national saving, can in certain cases reduce economic growth and even
contribute to international financial crises. A requirement that the
budget be balanced in each calendar year, however, is a misguided
overreaction to the fear that in some cases, budget deficits can become
too large.</span>

  

  

policies, the federal budget deficit and debt was historically high. One
way to try to cut federal spending and borrowing was to refuse to raise
the legal federal debt limit, or tie on conditions to appropriation
bills to stop the Affordable Health Care Act. This disagreement led to a
two-week federal government shutdown and got close to the deadline where
the federal government would default on its Treasury bonds. Finally,
however, a compromise emerged and the government avoided default. This
shows clearly how closely fiscal policies are tied to politics.

KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY

  

1.  <a href="#bookmark1386" class="a">Government</a>
    [Spending](#bookmark1386)

    Fiscal policy is the set of policies that relate to federal
    government spending, taxation, and borrowing. In recent decades, the
    level of federal government spending and taxes, expressed as a share
    of GDP, has not changed much, typically fluctuating between about
    18% to 22% of GDP. However, the level of state spending and taxes,
    as a share of GDP, has risen from about 12–13% to about 20% of GDP
    over the last four decades. The four main areas of federal spending
    are national defense, Social Security, healthcare, and interest
    payments, which together account for about 70% of all federal
    spending. When a government spends more than it collects in taxes,
    it is said to have a budget deficit. When a government collects more
    in taxes than it spends, it is said to have a budget surplus. If
    government spending and taxes are equal, it is said to have a
    balanced budget. The sum of all past deficits and surpluses make up
    the government debt.

      

2.  [Taxation](#bookmark1393)

    The two main federal taxes are individual income taxes and payroll
    taxes that provide funds for Social Security and Medicare; these
    taxes together account for more than 80% of federal revenues. Other
    federal taxes include the corporate income tax, excise taxes on
    alcohol, gasoline and tobacco, and the estate and gift tax. A
    progressive tax is one, like the federal income tax, where those
    with higher incomes pay a higher share of taxes out of their income
    than those with lower incomes. A proportional tax is one, like the
    payroll tax for Medicare, where everyone pays the same share of
    taxes regardless of income level. A regressive tax is one, like the
    payroll tax (above a certain threshold) that supports Social
    Security, where those with high income pay a lower share of income
    in taxes than those with lower incomes.

      

3.  <a href="#bookmark1405" class="a">Federal Deficits and the National</a>
    [Debt](#bookmark1405)

    For most of the twentieth century, the U.S. government took on debt
    during wartime and then paid down that debt slowly in peacetime.
    However, it took on quite substantial debts in peacetime in the
    1980s and early 1990s, before a brief period of budget surpluses
    from 1998 to 2001, followed by a return to annual budget deficits
    since 2002, with very large deficits in the recession of 2008
    and 2009. A budget deficit or budget surplus is measured annually.
    Total government debt or national debt is the sum of budget deficits
    and budget surpluses over time.

      

4.  <a href="#bookmark1411" class="a">Using Fiscal Policy to Fight Recession, Unemployment, and</a>
    [Inflation](#bookmark1411)

    Expansionary fiscal policy increases the level of aggregate demand,
    either through increases in government spending or through
    reductions in taxes. Expansionary fiscal policy is most appropriate
    when an economy is in recession and producing below its potential
    GDP. Contractionary fiscal policy decreases the level of aggregate
    demand, either through cuts in government spending or increases in
    taxes. Contractionary fiscal policy is most appropriate when an
    economy is producing above its potential GDP.

      

5.  <a href="#bookmark1418" class="a">Automatic</a>
    [Stabilizers](#bookmark1418)

    Fiscal policy is conducted both through discretionary fiscal policy,
    which occurs when the government enacts taxation or spending changes
    in response to economic events, or through automatic stabilizers,
    which are taxing and spending mechanisms that, by their design,
    shift in response to economic events without any further
    legislation. The standardized employment budget is the calculation
    of what the budget deficit or budget surplus would have been in a
    given year if the economy had been producing at its potential GDP in
    that year. Many economists and politicians criticize the use of
    fiscal policy for a variety of reasons, including concerns over time
    lags, the impact on interest rates, and the inherently political
    nature of fiscal policy. We cover the critique of fiscal policy in
    the next module.

      

6.  <a href="#bookmark1423" class="a">Practical Problems with Discretionary Fiscal</a>
    [Policy](#bookmark1423)

    Because fiscal policy affects the quantity of money that the
    government borrows in financial capital markets, it not only affects
    aggregate demand—it can also affect interest rates. If an
    expansionary fiscal policy also causes higher interest rates, then
    firms and households are discouraged from borrowing and spending,
    reducing aggregate demand in a situation called crowding out. Given
    the uncertainties over interest rate effects, time lags
    (implementation lag, legislative lag, and recognition lag),
    temporary and permanent policies, and unpredictable political
    behavior, many economists and knowledgeable policymakers have
    concluded that discretionary fiscal policy is a blunt instrument and
    better used only in extreme situations.

      

7.  <a href="#bookmark1431" class="a">The Question of a Balanced</a>
    [Budget](#bookmark1431)

Balanced budget amendments are a popular political idea, but the
economic merits behind such proposals are questionable. Most economists
accept that fiscal policy needs to be flexible enough to accommodate
unforeseen expenditures, such as wars or recessions. While persistent,
large budget deficits can indeed be a problem, a balanced budget
amendment prevents even small, temporary deficits that might, in some
cases, be necessary.

    1.  Why is government spending typically measured as a percentage of
        GDP rather than in nominal dollars?

    2.  Why are expenditures such as crime prevention and education
        typically done at the state and local level rather than at the
        federal level?

    3.  Why is spending by the U.S. government on scientific research at
        NASA fiscal policy while spending by the University of Illinois
        is not fiscal policy? Why is a cut in the payroll tax fiscal
        policy whereas a cut in a state income tax is not fiscal policy?

    Financing Higher Education

    On November 8, 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed The Higher
    Education Act of 1965 into law. With a stroke of the pen, he
    implemented what we know as the financial aid, work study, and
    student loan programs to help Americans pay for a college education.
    In his remarks, the President said:

    Here the seeds were planted from which grew my firm conviction that
    for the individual, education is the path to achievement and
    fulfillment; for the Nation, it is a path to a society that is not
    only free but civilized; and for the world, it is the path to
    peace—for it is education that places reason over force.

    This Act, he said, "is responsible for funding higher education for
    millions of Americans. It is the embodiment of the United States’
    investment in ‘human capital’." Since Johnson signed the Act into
    law, the government has renewed it several times.

    The purpose of The Higher Education Act of 1965 was to build the
    country’s human capital by creating educational opportunity for
    millions of Americans. The three criteria that the government uses
    to judge eligibility are income, full-time or part-time attendance,
    and the cost of the institution. According to the 2011–2012 National
    Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:12), in the 2011–2012 school
    year, over 70% of all full-time college students received some form
    of federal financial aid; 47% received grants; and another 55%
    received federal government student loans. The budget to support
    financial aid has increased not only because of more enrollment, but
    also because of increased tuition and fees for higher education.

    <span id="bookmark1483">Figure 18.1 President Lyndon B.
    Johnson</span> <span class="s37">President Lyndon Johnson played a
    pivotal role in financing higher education. (Credit: modification of
    image by LBJ Museum & Library)</span>

      

      

    The current Trump administration is currently questioning these
    increases and the entire notion of how the government should deal
    with higher education. The President and Congress are charged with
    balancing fiscal responsibility and important government-financed
    expenditures like investing in human capital.

      

    #### Introduction to the Impacts of Government Borrowing

    In this chapter, you will learn about:

2.  How Government Borrowing Affects Investment and the Trade Balance

3.  Fiscal Policy, Investment, and Economic Growth

4.  How Government Borrowing Affects Private Saving

5.  Fiscal Policy and the Trade Balance

      

    Governments have many competing demands for financial support. Any
    spending should be tempered by fiscal responsibility and by looking
    carefully at the spending’s impact. When a government spends more
    than it collects in taxes, it runs a budget deficit. It then needs
    to borrow. When government borrowing becomes especially large and
    sustained, it can substantially reduce the financial capital
    available to private sector firms, as well as lead to trade
    imbalances and even financial crises.

    <a href="#bookmark1384" class="s34">The</a>
    <a href="#bookmark1384" class="a">Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy</a>
    <a href="#bookmark780" class="s34">chapter introduced the concepts of deficits and debt, as well as how a government could use fiscal policy to address recession or inflation. This chapter begins by building on the national savings and investment identity, which we first first introduced in</a>
    <a href="#bookmark780" class="a">The International Trade and Capital</a>
    Flows <span class="p">chapter, to show how government borrowing
    affects firms’ physical capital investment levels and trade
    balances. A prolonged period of budget deficits may lead to lower
    economic growth, in part because the funds that the government
    borrows to fund its budget deficits are typically no longer
    available for private investment. Moreover, a sustained pattern of
    large budget deficits can lead to disruptive economic patterns of
    high inflation, substantial inflows of financial capital from
    abroad, plummeting exchange rates, and heavy strains on a country’s
    banking and financial system.</span>

    1.  <span id="bookmark1477">|</span> <span
        style=" color: #3767B1;">How Government Borrowing Affects
        Investment and the Trade Balance</span><span
        id="bookmark1484">‌</span>

        By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        -   Explain the national saving and investment identity in terms
            of demand and supply

        -   Evaluate the role of budget surpluses and trade surpluses in
            national saving and investment identity

              

            When governments are borrowers in financial markets, there
            are three possible sources for the funds from a
            macroeconomic point of view: (1) households might save
            more; (2) private firms might borrow less; and (3) the
            additional funds for government borrowing might come from
            outside the country, from foreign financial investors. Let’s
            begin with a review of why one of these three options must
            occur, and then explore how interest rates and exchange
            rates adjust to these connections.

            The National Saving and Investment Identity

            <a href="#bookmark780" id="bookmark1485" class="s34">The national saving and investment identity, which we first introduced in</a>
            <a href="#bookmark780" class="a">The International Trade and Capital Flows</a>
            <span class="p">chapter, provides a framework for showing
            the relationships between the sources of demand and supply
            in financial capital markets. The identity begins with a
            statement that must always hold true: the quantity of
            financial capital supplied in the market must equal the
            quantity of financial capital demanded.</span>

            The U.S. economy has two main sources for financial capital:
            private savings from inside the U.S. economy and public
            savings.

            Total savings = Private savings (S) + Public savings (T – G)

              

              

            <a href="#bookmark780" class="s34">These include the inflow of foreign financial capital from abroad. The inflow of savings from abroad is, by definition, equal to the trade deficit, as we explained in</a>
            <a href="#bookmark780" class="a">The International Trade and Capital Flows</a>
            <span class="p">chapter. We can write this inflow of foreign
            investment capital as imports (M) minus exports (X). There
            are also two main sources of demand for financial capital:
            private sector investment (I) and government borrowing.
            Government borrowing in any given year is equal to the
            budget deficit, which we can write as the difference between
            government spending (G) and net taxes (T). Let’s call this
            equation 1.</span>

            Quantity supplied of financial capital = Quantity demanded
            of financial capital

            Private savings + Inflow of foreign savings = Private
            investment + Government budget deficit

            S + (M – X) = I + (G –T)

            Governments often spend more than they receive in taxes and,
            therefore, public savings (T – G) is negative. This causes a
            need to borrow money in the amount of (G – T) instead of
            adding to the nation’s savings. If this is the case, we can
            view governments as demanders of financial capital instead
            of suppliers. In algebraic terms, we can rewrite the
            national savings and investment identity like this:

            Private investment = Private savings + Public savings +
            Trade deficit I = S + (T – G) + (M – X)

            <a href="#bookmark1486" class="s34">Let’s call this equation 2. We must accompany a change in any part of the national saving and investment identity by offsetting changes in at least one other part of the equation because we assume that the equality of quantity supplied and quantity demanded always holds. If the government budget deficit changes, then either private saving or investment or the trade balance—or some combination of the three—must change as well.</a>
            <a href="#bookmark1486" class="a">Figure 18.2</a> <span
            class="p">shows the possible effects.</span>

              

            <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_377.jpg" width="624" height="179" alt="image" />

              

            <span id="bookmark1486">Figure 18.2 Effects of Change in
            Budget Surplus or Deficit on Investment, Savings, and The
            Trade Balance</span> <span class="s37">Chart (a) shows the
            potential results when the budget deficit rises (or budget
            surplus falls). Chart (b) shows the potential results when
            the budget deficit falls (or budget surplus rises).</span>

            What about Budget Surpluses and Trade Surpluses?

            <span id="bookmark1487">The national saving and investment
            identity must always hold true because, by definition, the
            quantity supplied and quantity demanded in the financial
            capital market must always be equal. However, the formula
            will look somewhat different if the government budget is in
            deficit rather than surplus or if the balance of trade is in
            surplus rather than deficit. For example, in 1999 and 2000,
            the U.S. government had budget surpluses, although the
            economy was still experiencing trade deficits. When the
            government was running budget surpluses, it was acting as a
            saver rather than a borrower, and supplying rather than
            demanding financial capital. As a result, we would write the
            national saving and investment identity during this time
            as:</span><span id="bookmark1488">‌</span>

            Quantity supplied of financial capital = Quantity demanded
            of financial capital Private savings + Trade deficit +
            Government surplus = Private investment

            S + (M – X) + (T – G) = I

            Let's call this equation 3. Notice that this expression is
            mathematically the same as equation 2 except the savings and
            investment sides of the identity have simply flipped sides.

            During the 1960s, the U.S. government was often running a
            budget deficit, but the economy was typically running

              

              

            trade surpluses. Since a trade surplus means that an economy
            is experiencing a net outflow of financial capital, we would
            write the national saving and investment identity as:

            Quantity supplied of financial capital = Quantity demanded
            of financial capital

            Private savings = Private investment + Outflow of foreign
            savings + Government budget deficit S = I + (X – M) + (G
            – T)

            Instead of the balance of trade representing part of the
            supply of financial capital, which occurs with a trade
            deficit, a trade surplus represents an outflow of financial
            capital leaving the domestic economy and invested elsewhere
            in the world.

            Quantity supplied of financial capital = Quantity demanded
            of financial capital demand

            Private savings = Private investment + Government budget
            deficit + Trade surplus S = I + (G – T) + (X – M)

            We assume that the point to these equations is that the
            national saving and investment identity always hold. When
            you write these relationships, it is important to engage
            your brain and think about what is on the supply and demand
            side of the financial capital market before you start your
            calculations.

<a href="#bookmark952" class="s34">Government budget balances can affect the trade balance. As</a>
<a href="#bookmark952" class="a">The Keynesian Perspective</a> <span
class="p">chapter discusses, a net inflow of foreign financial
investment always accompanies a trade deficit, while a net outflow of
financial investment always accompanies a trade surplus. One way to
understand the connection from budget deficits to trade deficits is that
when government creates a budget deficit with some combination of tax
cuts or spending increases, it will increase aggregate demand in the
economy, and some of that increase in aggregate demand will result in a
higher level of imports. A higher level of imports, with exports
remaining fixed, will cause a larger trade deficit. That means
foreigners’ holdings of dollars increase as Americans purchase more
imported goods. Foreigners use those dollars to invest in the United
States, which leads to an inflow of foreign investment. One possible
source of funding our budget deficit is foreigners buying Treasury
securities that the U.S. government sells, thus a trade deficit often
accompanies a budget deficit.</span>

Twin Deficits?

<a href="#bookmark1491" class="s34">In the mid-1980s, it was common to hear economists and even newspaper articles refer to the twin deficits, as the budget deficit and trade deficit both grew substantially.</a>
<a href="#bookmark1491" class="a">Figure 18.4</a> <span class="p">shows
the pattern. The federal budget deficit went from 2.6% of GDP in 1981 to
5.1% of GDP in 1985—a drop of 2.5% of GDP. Over that time, the trade
deficit moved from 0.5% in 1981 to 2.9% in 1985—a drop of 2.4% of GDP.
In the mid-1980s an inflow of foreign investment capital matched, the
considerable increase in government borrowing, so the government budget
deficit and the trade deficit moved together.</span>

  

<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_379.jpg" width="506" height="254" alt="image" />

<span id="bookmark1491">Figure 18.4 U.S. Budget Deficits and Trade
Deficits</span> <span class="s37">In the 1980s, the budget deficit and
the trade deficit declined at the same time. However, since then, the
deficits have stopped being twins. The trade deficit grew smaller in the
early 1990s as the budget deficit increased, and then the trade deficit
grew larger in the late 1990s as the budget deficit turned into a
surplus. In the first half of the 2000s, both budget and trade deficits
increased. However, in 2009, the trade deficit declined as the budget
deficit increased.</span>

  

Of course, no one should expect the budget deficit and trade deficit to
move in lockstep, because the other parts of the national saving and
investment identity—investment and private savings—will often change as
well. In the late 1990s, for example, the government budget balance
turned from deficit to surplus, but the trade deficit remained large and
growing. During this time, the inflow of foreign financial investment
was supporting a surge of physical capital investment by U.S. firms. In
the first half of the 2000s, the budget and trade deficits again
increased together, but in

  

2009, the budget deficit increased while the trade deficit declined. The
budget deficit and the trade deficits are related to each other, but
they are more like cousins than twins.

Budget Deficits and Exchange Rates

<a href="#bookmark1493" id="bookmark1492" class="s34">Exchange rates can also help to explain why budget deficits are linked to trade deficits.</a>
<a href="#bookmark1493" class="a">Figure 18.5</a><span class="s54">
</span>shows a situation using the exchange rate for the U.S. dollar,
measured in euros. At the original equilibrium (E<span
class="s60">0</span>), where the demand for

U.S. dollars (D<span class="s60">0</span>) intersects with the supply of
U.S. dollars (S<span class="s60">0</span>) on the foreign exchange
market, the exchange rate is

0.9 euros per U.S. dollar and the equilibrium quantity traded in the
market is $100 billion per day (which was roughly the quantity of
dollar–euro trading in exchange rate markets in the mid-2000s). Then the
U.S. budget deficit rises and foreign financial investment provides the
source of funds for that budget deficit.

International financial investors, as a group, will demand more U.S.
dollars on foreign exchange markets to purchase the U.S. government
bonds, and they will supply fewer of the U.S. dollars that they already
hold in these markets. Demand for U.S. dollars on the foreign exchange
market shifts from D<span class="s60">0</span> to D<span
class="s60">1</span> and the supply of U.S. dollars falls from S<span
class="s60">0</span> to S<span class="s60">1</span>. At the new
equilibrium (E<span class="s60">1</span>), the exchange rate has
appreciated to 1.05 euros per dollar while, in this example, the
quantity of dollars traded remains the same.

  

<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_380.jpg" width="262" height="218" alt="image" />

<span id="bookmark1493"><span class="s36">Figure 18.5 Budget Deficits
and Exchange Rates </span></span>Imagine that the U.S. government
increases its borrowing and the funds come from European financial
investors. To purchase U.S. government bonds, those European investors
will need to demand more U.S. dollars on foreign exchange markets,
causing the demand for U.S. dollars to shift to the right from D<span
class="s63">0</span> to D<span class="s63">1</span>. European financial
investors as a group will also be less likely to supply U.S. dollars to
the foreign exchange markets, causing the supply of U.S. dollars to
shift from S<span class="s63">0</span> to S<span class="s63">1</span>.
The equilibrium exchange rate strengthens from 0.9 euro/ dollar at
E<span class="s63">0</span> to 1.05 euros/dollar at E<span
class="s63">1</span>.

  

A stronger exchange rate, of course, makes it more difficult for
exporters to sell their goods abroad while making imports cheaper, so a
trade deficit (or a reduced trade surplus) results. Thus, a budget
deficit can easily result in an inflow of foreign financial capital, a
stronger exchange rate, and a trade deficit.

<a href="#bookmark1504" class="s34">You can also imagine interest rates are driving the exchange rate appreciation. As we explained earlier in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1504" class="a">Figure</a> 18.8<span class="p">, a
budget deficit increases demand in markets for domestic financial
capital, raising the domestic interest rate. A higher interest rate will
attract an inflow of foreign financial capital, and appreciate the
exchange rate in response to the increase in demand for U.S. dollars by
foreign investors and a decrease in supply of U. S. dollars. Because of
higher interest rates in the United States, Americans find U.S. bonds
more attractive than foreign bonds. When Americans are buying fewer
foreign bonds, they are supplying fewer U.S. dollars. U.S. dollar
depreciation leads to a larger trade deficit (or reduced surplus). The
connections between inflows of foreign investment capital, interest
rates, and exchange rates are all just different ways of drawing the
same economic connections: a larger budget deficit can result in a
larger trade deficit, although do not expect the connection to be
one-to-one.</span>

From Budget Deficits to International Economic Crisis

<a href="#bookmark1285" class="s34">We lay out step-by-step the economic story of how an outflow of international financial capital can cause a deep recession in the</a>
<a href="#bookmark1285" class="a">Exchange Rates and International Capital</a>
Flows <span class="p">chapter. When international financial investors
decide to withdraw their funds from a country like Turkey, they increase
the supply of the Turkish lira and reduce the demand for lira,
depreciating the lira exchange rate. When firms and the government in a
country like</span>

  

  

Turkey borrow money in international financial markets, they typically
do so in stages. First, banks in Turkey borrow in a widely used currency
like U.S. dollars or euros, then convert those U.S. dollars to lira, and
then lend the money to borrowers in Turkey. If the lira's exchange rate
value depreciates, then Turkey’s banks will find it impossible to repay
the international loans that are in U.S. dollars or euros.

<span id="bookmark1494">The combination of less foreign investment
capital and banks that are bankrupt can sharply reduce aggregate demand,
which causes a deep recession. Many countries around the world have
experienced this kind of recession in recent years: along with Turkey in
2002, Mexico followed this general pattern in 1995, Thailand and
countries across East Asia in 1997–1998, Russia in 1998, and Argentina
in 2002. In many of these countries, large government budget deficits
played a role in setting the stage for the financial crisis. A moderate
increase in a budget deficit that leads to a moderate increase in a
trade deficit and a moderate appreciation of the exchange rate is not
necessarily a cause for concern. However, beyond some point that is hard
to define in advance, a series of large budget deficits can become a
cause for concern among international investors.</span>

<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_381.png" width="624" height="515" alt="image" />

One reason for concern is that extremely large budget deficits mean that
aggregate demand may shift so far to the right as to cause high
inflation. The example of Turkey is a situation where very large budget
deficits brought inflation rates well into double digits. In addition,
very large budget deficits at some point begin to raise a fear that the
government would not repay the borrowing. In the last 175 years, the
government of Turkey has been unable to pay its debts and defaulted on
its loans six times. Brazil’s government has been unable to pay its
debts and defaulted on its loans seven times; Venezuela, nine times; and
Argentina, five times. The risk of high inflation or a default on
repaying international loans will worry international investors, since
both factors imply that the rate of return on their investments in that
country may end up lower than expected. If international investors start
withdrawing the funds from a country rapidly, the scenario of less
investment, a depreciated exchange rate, widespread bank failure, and
deep recession can occur. The following Clear It Up feature explains
other impacts of large deficits.

  

What are the risks of chronic large deficits in the United States?

If a government runs large budget deficits for a sustained period of
time, what can go wrong? According to a recent Brookings Institution
report, a key risk of a large budget deficit is that government debt may
grow too high compared to the country’s GDP growth. As debt grows, the
national savings rate will decline, leaving less available in financial
capital for private investment. The impact of chronically large budget
deficits is as follows:

-   As the population ages, there will be an increasing demand for
    government services that may cause higher government deficits.
    Government borrowing and its interest payments will pull resources
    away from domestic investment in human capital and physical capital
    that is essential to economic growth.

-   Interest rates may start to rise so that the cost of financing
    government debt will rise as well, creating pressure on the
    government to reduce its budget deficits through spending cuts and
    tax increases. These steps will be politically painful, and they
    will also have a contractionary effect on aggregate demand in the
    economy.

-   Rising percentage of debt to GDP will create uncertainty in the
    financial and global markets that might cause a country to resort to
    inflationary tactics to reduce the real value of the debt
    outstanding. This will decrease real wealth and damage confidence in
    the country’s ability to manage its spending. After all, if the
    government has borrowed at a fixed interest rate of, say, 5%, and it
    lets inflation rise above that 5%, then it will effectively be able
    to repay its debt at a negative real interest rate.

The conventional reasoning suggests that the relationship between
sustained deficits that lead to high levels of government debt and
long-term growth is negative. How significant this relationship is, how
big an issue it is compared to other macroeconomic issues, and the
direction of causality, is less clear.

What remains important to acknowledge is that the relationship between
debt and growth is negative and that for some countries, the
relationship may be stronger than in others. It is also important to
acknowledge the direction of causality: does high debt cause slow
growth, slow growth cause high debt, or are both high debt and slow
growth the result of third factors? In our analysis, we have argued
simply that high debt causes slow

  

growth. There may be more to this debate than we have space to discuss
here.

  

Using Fiscal Policy to Address Trade Imbalances

If a nation is experiencing the inflow of foreign investment capital
associated with a trade deficit because foreign investors are making
long-term direct investments in firms, there may be no substantial
reason for concern. After all, many low-income nations around the world
would welcome direct investment by multinational firms that ties them
more closely into the global networks of production and distribution of
goods and services. In this case, the inflows of foreign investment
capital and the trade deficit are attracted by the opportunities for a
good rate of return on private sector investment in an economy.

However, governments should beware of a sustained pattern of high budget
deficits and high trade deficits. The danger arises in particular when
the inflow of foreign investment capital is not funding long-term
physical capital investment by firms, but instead is short-term
portfolio investment in government bonds. When inflows of foreign
financial investment reach high levels, foreign financial investors will
be on the alert for any reason to fear that the country’s exchange rate
may decline or the government may be unable to repay what it has
borrowed on time. Just as a few falling rocks can trigger an avalanche;
a relatively small piece of bad news about an economy can trigger an
enormous outflow of short-term financial capital.

Financing Higher Education

Between 1982 and 2012, the increases in the cost of a college education
had far outpaced that of the income of the typical American family.
According to President Obama’s research staff, the cost of education at
a four-year public college increased by 257% compared to an increase in
family incomes of only 16% over the prior 30 years. The ongoing debate
over a balanced budget and proposed cutbacks accentuated the need to
increase investment in human capital to grow the economy versus
deepening the already significant debt levels of the U.S. government. In
summer 2013, President Obama presented a plan to make college more
affordable that included increasing Pell Grant awards and the number of
recipients, caps on interest rates for student loans, and providing
education tax credits. In addition, the plan includes an accountability
method for institutions of higher education that focuses on completion
rates and creates a College Scorecard. Whether or not all these
initiatives come to fruition remains to be seen, but they are indicative
of creative approaches that government can take to meet its obligation
from both a public and fiscal policy perspective.

Reducing a nation’s budget deficit will not always be a successful
method of reducing its trade deficit, because other elements of the
national saving and investment identity, like private saving or
investment, may change instead. In those cases when the budget deficit
is the main cause of the trade deficit, governments should take steps to
reduce their budget deficits, lest they make their economy vulnerable to
a rapid outflow of international financial capital that could bring a
deep recession.

    Government Borrowing Affects Private Saving</span><span
    id="bookmark1495">‌</span>

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Apply Ricardian equivalence to evaluate how government borrowing
        affects private saving

    -   Interpret a graphic representation of Ricardian equivalence

          

        A change in government budgets may impact private saving.
        Imagine that people watch government budgets and adjust their
        savings accordingly. For example, whenever the government runs a
        budget deficit, people might reason: “Well, a higher budget
        deficit means that I’m just going to owe more taxes in the
        future to pay off all that government borrowing, so I’ll start
        saving now.” If the government runs budget surpluses, people
        might reason: “With these budget surpluses (or lower budget
        deficits), interest rates are falling, so that saving is less
        attractive. Moreover, with

          

          

        a budget surplus the country will be able to afford a tax cut
        sometime in the future. I won’t bother saving as much now.”

        <span id="bookmark1496">The theory that rational private
        households might shift their saving to offset government saving
        or borrowing is known as</span> **Ricardian equivalence**
        because the idea has intellectual roots in the writings of the
        early nineteenth- century economist David Ricardo (1772–1823).
        If Ricardian equivalence holds completely true, then in the
        national saving and investment identity, any change in budget
        deficits or budget surpluses would be completely offset by a
        corresponding change in private saving. As a result, changes in
        government borrowing would have no effect at all on either
        physical capital investment or trade balances.

        <a href="#bookmark1497" class="s34">In practice, the private sector only sometimes and partially adjusts its savings behavior to offset government budget deficits and surpluses.</a>
        <a href="#bookmark1497" class="a">Figure 18.6</a> <span

        and surpluses and the rate of private saving—which includes
        saving by both households and firms—since 1980. The connection
        between the two is not at all obvious. In the mid-1980s, for
        example, government budget deficits were quite large, but there
        is no corresponding surge of private saving. However, when
        budget deficits turn to surpluses in the late 1990s, there is a
        simultaneous decline in private saving. When budget deficits get
        very large in 2008 and 2009, there is some sign of a rise in
        saving. A variety of statistical studies based on the U.S.
        experience suggests that when government borrowing increases by
        $1, private saving rises by about 30 cents. A World Bank study
        from the late 1990s, looking at government budgets and private
        saving behavior in countries around the world, found a similar
        result.</span>

        Private saving does increase to some extent when governments run
        large budget deficits, and private saving falls when governments
        reduce deficits or run large budget surpluses. However, the
        offsetting effects of private saving compared to government
        borrowing are much less than one-to-one. In addition, this
        effect can vary a great deal from country to country, from time
        to time, and over the short and the long run.

        <span id="bookmark1498">If the funding for a larger budget
        deficit comes from international financial investors, then a
        trade deficit may accompany a budget deficit. In some countries,

        international financial investors first to send their funds to a
        country and cause an appreciation of its exchange rate and then
        to pull their funds out and cause a depreciation of the exchange
        rate and a financial crisis as well. It depends on whether
        funding comes from international financial investors.

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Explain crowding out and its effect on physical capital
        investment

    -   Explain the relationship between budget deficits and interest
        rates

    -   Identify why economic growth is tied to investments in physical
        capital, human capital, and technology

  

The underpinnings of economic growth are investments in physical
capital, human capital, and technology, all set in an economic
environment where firms and individuals can react to the incentives
provided by well-functioning markets and flexible prices. Government
borrowing can reduce the financial capital available for private firms
to invest in physical capital. However, government spending can also
encourage certain elements of long-term growth, such as spending on
roads or water systems, on education, or on research and development
that creates new technology.

Crowding Out Physical Capital Investment

<span id="bookmark1500">A larger budget deficit will increase demand for
financial capital. If private saving and the trade balance remain the
same, then less financial capital will be available for private
investment in physical capital. When government borrowing soaks up
available financial capital and leaves less for private investment in
physical capital, economists call the result crowding out.</span><span

economy's situation before the exceptional circumstances of the
recession that started in late 2007. In 2005, for example, the budget
deficit was roughly 4% of GDP. Private investment by firms in the U.S.
economy has hovered in the range of 14% to 18% of GDP in recent decades.
However, in any given year, roughly half of U.S. investment in physical
capital just replaces machinery and equipment that has worn out or
become technologically obsolete. Only about half represents an increase
in the total quantity of physical capital in the economy. Investment in
new physical capital in any year is about 7% to 9% of GDP. In this
situation, even U.S. budget deficits in the range of 4% of GDP can
potentially crowd out a substantial share of new investment spending.
Conversely, a smaller budget deficit (or an increased budget surplus)
increases the pool of financial capital available for private
investment.

  

  

<a href="#bookmark1502" class="a">Figure 18.7</a> <span class="p">shows
the patterns of U.S. budget deficits and private investment since 1980.
If greater government deficits lead to less private investment in
physical capital, and reduced government deficits or budget surpluses
lead to more investment in physical capital, these two lines should move
up and down simultaneously. This pattern occurred in the late 1990s and
early 2000s. The U.S. federal budget went from a deficit of 2.2% of GDP
in 1995 to a budget surplus of 2.4% of GDP in 2000—a swing of 4.6% of
GDP. From 1995 to 2000, private investment in physical capital rose from
15% to 18% of GDP—a rise of 3% of GDP. Then, when the U.S. government
again started running budget deficits in the early 2000s, less financial
capital became available for private investment, and the rate of private
investment fell back to about 15% of GDP by 2003.</span>

<span id="bookmark1502">Figure 18.7 U.S. Budget Deficits/Surpluses and
Private Investment</span> <span class="s37">The connection between
private savings and flows of international capital plays a role in
budget deficits and surpluses. Consequently, government borrowing and
private investment sometimes rise and fall together. For example, the
1990s show a pattern in which reduced government borrowing helped to
reduce crowding out so that more funds were available for private
investment.</span>

  

This argument does not claim that a government's budget deficits will
exactly shadow its national rate of private investment; after all, we
must account for private saving and inflows of foreign financial
investment. In the mid-1980s, for example, government budget deficits
increased substantially without a corresponding drop off in private
investment. In 2009, nonresidential private fixed investment dropped by
$300 billion from its previous level of $1,941 billion in 2008,
primarily because, during a recession, firms lack both the funds and the
incentive to invest. Investment growth between 2009 and 2014 averaged
approximately 5.9% to $2,210.5 billion—only slightly above its 2008
level, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. During that same
period, interest rates dropped from 3.94% to less than a quarter percent
as the Federal Reserve took dramatic action to prevent a depression by
increasing the money supply through lowering short-term interest rates.
The "crowding out" of private investment due to government borrowing to
finance expenditures appears to have been suspended during the Great
Recession. However, as the economy improves and interest rates rise,
government borrowing may potentially create pressure on interest rates.

The Interest Rate Connection

<a href="#bookmark1504" id="bookmark1503" class="s34">Assume that government borrowing of substantial amounts will have an effect on the quantity of private investment. How will this affect interest rates in financial markets? In</a>
<a href="#bookmark1504" class="a">Figure</a> <span
class="s54">18.8</span>, the original equilibrium (E<span
class="s60">0</span>) where the demand curve (D<span
class="s60">0</span>) for financial capital intersects with the supply
curve (S<span class="s60">0</span>) occurs at an interest rate of 5% and
an equilibrium quantity equal to 20% of GDP. However, as the government
budget deficit increases, the demand curve for financial capital shifts
from D<span class="s60">0</span> to D<span class="s60">1</span>. The new
equilibrium (E<span class="s60">1</span>) occurs at an interest rate of
6% and an equilibrium quantity of 21% of GDP.

  

<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_386.jpg" width="235" height="211" alt="image" />

<span id="bookmark1504"><span class="s36">Figure 18.8 Budget Deficits
and Interest Rates </span></span>In the financial market, an increase in
government borrowing can shift the demand curve for financial capital to
the right from D<span class="s63">0</span> to D<span
class="s63">1</span>. As the equilibrium interest rate shifts from
E<span class="s63">0</span> to E<span class="s63">1</span>, the interest
rate rises from 5% to 6% in this example. The higher interest rate is
one economic mechanism by which government borrowing can crowd out
private investment.

  

A survey of economic studies on the connection between government
borrowing and interest rates in the U.S. economy suggests that an
increase of 1% in the budget deficit will lead to a rise in interest
rates of between 0.5 and 1.0%, other factors held equal. In turn, a
higher interest rate tends to discourage firms from making physical
capital investments. One reason government budget deficits crowd out
private investment, therefore, is the increase in interest rates. There
are, however, economic studies that show a limited connection between
the two (at least in the United States), but as the budget deficit
grows, the dangers of rising interest rates become more real.

<span id="bookmark1505">At this point, you may wonder about the Federal
Reserve. After all, can the Federal Reserve not use expansionary
monetary policy to reduce interest rates, or in this case, to prevent
interest rates from rising? This useful question emphasizes the
importance of considering how fiscal and monetary policies work in
relation to each other. Imagine a central bank faced with a government
that is running large budget deficits, causing a rise in interest rates
and crowding out private investment. If the budget deficits are
increasing aggregate demand when the economy is already producing near
potential GDP, threatening an inflationary increase in price levels, the
central bank may react with a contractionary monetary policy. In this
situation, the higher interest rates from the government borrowing would
be made even higher by contractionary monetary policy, and the
government borrowing might crowd out a great deal of private
investment.</span><span id="bookmark1506">‌</span>

<span id="bookmark1507">Alternatively, if the budget deficits are
increasing aggregate demand when the economy is producing substantially
less than potential GDP, an inflationary increase in the price level is
not much of a danger and the central bank might react with expansionary
monetary policy. In this situation, higher interest rates from
government borrowing would be largely offset by lower interest rates
from expansionary monetary policy, and there would be little crowding
out of private investment.</span>

However, even a central bank cannot erase the overall message of the
national savings and investment identity. If government borrowing rises,
then private investment must fall, or private saving must rise, or the
trade deficit must fall. By reacting with contractionary or expansionary
monetary policy, the central bank can only help to determine which of
these outcomes is likely.

Public Investment in Physical Capital

<a href="#bookmark1508" class="s34">Government can invest in physical capital directly: roads and bridges; water supply and sewers; seaports and airports; schools and hospitals; plants that generate electricity, like hydroelectric dams or windmills; telecommunications facilities; and military weapons. In 2014, the U.S. federal government budget for Fiscal Year 2014 shows that the United States spent about $92 billion on transportation, including highways, mass transit, and airports.</a>

Table 18.1 Grants for Major Physical Capital Investment, 2014

  

Public physical capital investment of this sort can increase the
economy's output and productivity. An economy with reliable roads and
electricity will be able to produce more. However, it is hard to
quantify how much government investment in physical capital will benefit
the economy, because government responds to political as well as
economic incentives. When a firm makes an investment in physical
capital, it is subject to the discipline of the market: If it does not
receive a positive return on investment, the firm may lose money or even
go out of business.

In some cases, lawmakers make investments in physical capital as a way
of spending money in key politicians' districts. The result may be
unnecessary roads or office buildings. Even if a project is useful and
necessary, it might be done in a way that is excessively costly, because
local contractors who make campaign contributions to politicians
appreciate the extra business. Alternatively, governments sometimes do
not make the investments they should because a decision to spend on
infrastructure does not need to just make economic sense. It must be
politically popular as well. Managing public investment cost-effectively
can be difficult.

If a government decides to finance an investment in public physical
capital with higher taxes or lower government spending in other areas,
it need not worry that it is directly crowding out private investment.
Indirectly however, higher household taxes could cut down on the level
of private savings available and have a similar effect. If a government
decides to finance an investment in public physical capital by
borrowing, it may end up increasing the quantity of public physical
capital at the cost of crowding out investment in private physical
capital, which could be more beneficial to the economy.

Public Investment in Human Capital

In most countries, the government plays a large role in society's
investment in human capital through the education system. A highly
educated and skilled workforce contributes to a higher rate of economic
growth. For the low-income nations of the world, additional investment
in human capital seems likely to increase productivity and growth. For
the United States, critics have raised tough questions about how much
increases in government spending on education will improve the actual
level of education.

<a href="#bookmark1509" class="s34">Among economists, discussions of education reform often begin with some uncomfortable facts. As</a>
<a href="#bookmark1509" class="a">Figure</a> 18.9 <span class="p">shows,
spending per student for kindergarten through grade 12 (K–12) increased
substantially in real dollars through 2010. The U.S. Census Bureau
reports that current spending per pupil for elementary and secondary
education rose from $5,001 in 1998 to $10,608 in 2012. However, as
measured by standardized tests like the SAT, the level of student
academic achievement has barely budged in recent decades. On
international tests, U.S. students lag behind students from many other
countries. (Of course, test scores are an imperfect measure of education
for a variety of reasons. It would be difficult, however, to argue that
there are not real problems in the U.S. education system and that the
tests are just inaccurate.)</span>

  

<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_387.jpg" width="433" height="230" alt="image" />

<span id="bookmark1509">Figure 18.9 Total Spending for Elementary,
Secondary, and Vocational Education (1998–2014) in the United
States</span> <span class="s37">The graph shows that government spending
on education was continually increasing up until 2006 where it leveled
off until 2008 when it increased dramatically. Since 2010, spending has
steadily decreased. (Source: Office of Management and Budget)</span>

  

The fact that increased financial resources have not brought greater
measurable gains in student performance has led some education experts
to question whether the problems may be due to structure, not just to
the resources spent.

<span id="bookmark1510">Other government programs seek to increase human
capital either before or after the K–12 education system. Programs for
early childhood education, like the federal</span> **Head Start
program**, are directed at families where the parents may have limited
educational and financial resources. Government also offers substantial
support for universities and colleges. For example, in the United States
about 60% of students take at least a few college or university classes
beyond the high school level. In Germany and Japan, about half of all
students take classes beyond the comparable high school level. In the
countries of Latin America, only about one student in four takes classes
beyond the high school level, and in the nations of sub-Saharan Africa,
only about one student in 20.

<span id="bookmark1511">Not all spending on educational human capital
needs to happen through the government: many college students in the
United States pay a substantial share of the cost of their education. If
low-income countries of the world are going to experience a widespread
increase in their education levels for grade-school children, government
spending seems likely to play a substantial role. For the U.S. economy,
and for other high-income countries, the primary focus at this time is
more on how to get a bigger return from existing spending on education
and how to improve the performance of the average high school graduate,
rather than dramatic increases in education spending.</span>

How Fiscal Policy Can Improve Technology

Research and development (R&D) efforts are the lifeblood of new
technology. According to the National Science Foundation, federal
outlays for research, development, and physical plant improvements to
various governmental agencies have remained at an average of 8.8% of
GDP. About one-fifth of U.S. R&D spending goes to defense and
space-oriented research. Although defense-oriented R&D spending may
sometimes produce consumer-oriented spinoffs, R&D that is aimed at
producing new weapons is less likely to benefit the civilian economy
than direct civilian R&D spending.

Fiscal policy can encourage R&D using either direct spending or tax
policy. Government could spend more on the R&D that it carries out in
government laboratories, as well as expanding federal R&D grants to
universities and colleges, nonprofit organizations, and the private
sector. By 2014, the federal share of R&D outlays totaled $135.5
billion, or about 4% of the federal government's total budget outlays,
according to data from the National Science Foundation. Fiscal policy
can also support R&D through tax incentives, which allow firms to reduce
their tax bill as they increase spending on research and development.

Summary of Fiscal Policy, Investment, and Economic Growth

<a href="#bookmark1512" class="s34">Investment in physical capital, human capital, and new technology is essential for long-term economic growth, as</a>
<a href="#bookmark1512" class="a">Table 18.2</a> <span

might crowd out</span>

  

  

such investment. We will see the effects of many growth-oriented
policies very gradually over time, as students are better educated, we
make physical capital investments, and man invents and implements new
technologies.

KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY

  

1.  <a href="#bookmark1484" class="a">How Government Borrowing Affects Investment and the Trade</a>
    [Balance](#bookmark1484)

    A change in any part of the national saving and investment identity
    suggests that if the government budget deficit changes, then either
    private savings, private investment in physical capital, or the
    trade balance—or some combination of the three—must change as well.

      

2.  <a href="#bookmark1490" class="a">Fiscal Policy and the Trade</a>
    [Balance](#bookmark1490)

    The government need not balance its budget every year. However, a
    sustained pattern of large budget deficits over time risks causing
    several negative macroeconomic outcomes: a shift to the right in
    aggregate demand that causes an inflationary increase in the price
    level; crowding out private investment in physical capital in a way
    that slows down economic growth; and creating a dependence on
    inflows of international portfolio investment which can sometimes
    turn into outflows of foreign financial investment that can be
    injurious to a macroeconomy.

      

3.  <a href="#bookmark1495" class="a">How Government Borrowing Affects Private</a>
    [Saving](#bookmark1495)

    The theory of Ricardian equivalence holds that changes in private
    saving will offset changes in government borrowing or saving. Thus,
    greater private saving will offset higher budget deficits, while
    greater private borrowing will offset larger budget surpluses. If
    the theory holds true, then changes in government borrowing or
    saving would have no effect on private investment in physical
    capital or on the trade balance. However, empirical evidence
    suggests that the theory holds true only partially.

      

4.  <a href="#bookmark1499" class="a">Fiscal Policy, Investment, and Economic</a>
    [Growth](#bookmark1499)

Economic growth comes from a combination of investment in physical
capital, human capital, and technology. Government borrowing can crowd
out private sector investment in physical capital, but fiscal policy can
also increase investment in publicly owned physical capital, human
capital (education), and research and development. Possible methods for
improving education and society’s investment in human capital include
spending more money on teachers and other educational resources, and
reorganizing the education system to provide greater incentives for
success. Methods for increasing research and development spending to
generate new technology include direct government spending on R&D and
tax incentives for businesses to conduct additional R&D.

    CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS

      

    1.  Assume there is no discretionary increase in government
        spending. Explain how an improving economy will affect the
        budget balance and, in turn, investment and the trade balance.

    2.  Explain how decreased domestic investments that occur due to a
        budget deficit will affect future economic growth.

    3.  The U.S. government has shut down a number of times in recent
        history. Explain how a government shutdown will affect the
        variables in the national investment and savings identity. Could
        the shutdown affect the government budget deficit?

    4.  Explain how a shift from a government budget deficit to a budget
        surplus might affect the exchange rate.

    5.  Describe how a plan for reducing the government deficit might
        affect a college student, a young professional, and a
        middle-income family.

11. What are some of the ways fiscal policy might encourage economic
    growth?

12. What are some fiscal policies for improving a society’s human
    capital?

13. What are some fiscal policies for improving the technologies that
    the economy will have to draw upon in the future?

14. Explain how cuts in funding for programs such as Head Start might
    affect the development of human capital in the United States.

  

1.  Explain whether or not you agree with the premise of the Ricardian
    equivalence theory that rational people might reason: “Well, a
    higher budget deficit (surplus) means that I’m just going to owe
    more (less) taxes in the future to pay off all that government
    borrowing, so I’ll start saving (spending) now.” Why or why not?

2.  Explain why the government might prefer to provide incentives to
    private firms to do investment or research and development, rather
    than simply doing the spending itself?

3.  Under what condition would crowding out not inhibit long-run
    economic growth? Under what condition would crowding out impede
    long-run economic growth?

4.  What must take place for the government to run deficits without any
    crowding out?

      

    PROBLEMS

5.  Sketch a diagram of how a budget deficit causes a trade deficit.
    (*Hint*: Begin with what will happen to the exchange rate when
    foreigners demand more U.S. government debt.)

6.  Sketch a diagram of how sustained budget deficits cause low economic
    growth.

7.  Assume that the newly independent government of Tanzania employed
    you in 1964. Now free from British rule, the Tanzanian parliament
    has decided that it will spend 10 million shillings on schools,
    roads, and healthcare for the year. You estimate that the net taxes
    for the year are eight million shillings. The government will
    finance the difference by selling 10-year government bonds at 12%
    interest per year. Parliament must add the interest on outstanding
    bonds to government expenditure each year. Assume that Parliament
    places additional taxes to finance this increase in government
    expenditure so the gap between government spending is always two
    million. If the school, road, and healthcare budget are unchanged,
    compute the value of the accumulated debt in 10 years.

      

8.  Illustrate the concept of Ricardian equivalence using the demand and
    supply of financial capital graph.

9.  During the most recent recession, some economists argued that the
    change in the interest rates that comes about due to deficit
    spending implied in the demand and supply of financial capital graph
    would not occur. A simple reason was that the government was
    stepping in to invest when private firms were not. Using a graph,
    explain how the use by government in investment offsets the deficit
    demand.

Youth Unemployment: Three Cases

Chad Harding, a young man from Cape Town, South Africa, completed school
having done well on his exams. He had high hopes for the future. Like
many young South Africans, however, he had difficulty finding a job. “I
was just stuck at home waiting, waiting for something to come up,” he
said in a BBC interview in 2012. In South Africa 54.6% of young females
and 47.2% of males are unemployed. In fact, the problem is not limited
to South Africa. Seventy-three million of the world’s youth aged 15 to
24 are currently unemployed, according to the International Labour
Organization.

According to the *Wall Street Journal,* in India, 60% of the labor force
is self-employed, largely because of labor market regulation. A recent
World Bank World Development Report says that India’s unemployed youth
accounted for 9.9% of the youth work force in 2010. In Spain (a far
richer country) in the same year, the female/male youth unemployment
rate was 39.8% and 43.2% respectively.

Youth unemployment is a significant issue in many parts of the world.
However, despite the apparent

Unemployment is an issue that has different causes in different
countries, and is especially severe in the low- and middle-income
economies around the world. (Credit: modification of work by Daniel

similarities in rates between South Africa, Spain, and India,
macroeconomic policy solutions to decrease youth unemployment in these
three countries are different. This chapter will look at macroeconomic
policies around the world, specifically those related to reducing
unemployment, promoting economic growth, and stable inflation and
exchange rates. Then we will look again at the three cases of South
Africa, Spain, and India.

  

#### Introduction to Macroeconomic Policy around the World

In this chapter, you will learn about:

The Diversity of Countries and Economies across the World

Improving Countries’ Standards of Living

Causes of Unemployment around the World

Causes of Inflation in Various Countries and Regions

Balance of Trade Concerns

  

There are extraordinary differences in the composition and performance
of economies across the world. What explains these differences? Are
countries motivated by similar goals when it comes to macroeconomic
policy? Can we apply the same macroeconomic framework that we developed
in this text to understand the performance of these countries? Let’s
take each of these questions in turn.

Explaining
differences<a href="#bookmark619" class="s34">: Recall from</a> <span
class="s54">Unemployment </span><span class="p">that we explained the
difference in composition and performance of economies by appealing to
an aggregate production function. We argued that differences in
productivity explain the diversity of average incomes across the world,
which in turn were affected by inputs such as capital deepening, human
capital, and “technology.” Every economy has its own distinctive
economic characteristics, institutions, history, and political
realities, which imply that access to these “ingredients” will vary by
country and so will economic performance.</span>

For example, South Korea invested heavily in education and technology to
increase agricultural productivity in the early 1950s. Some of this
investment came from its historical relationship with the United States.
As a result of these and many other institutions, its economy has
managed to converge to the levels of income in leading economies like
Japan and the United States.

Similar goals and
frameworks<a href="#bookmark432" class="s34">: Many economies that have performed well in terms of per capita income have—for better or worse—been motivated by a similar goal: to maintain the quality of life of their citizens. Quality of life is a broad term, but as you can imagine it includes but is not limited to such things as low level of unemployment, price stability (low levels of inflation), and the ability to trade. These seem to be universal macroeconomic goals as we discussed in</a>
<a href="#bookmark432" class="a">The Macroeconomic</a> <span
class="s54">Perspective</span><span class="p">. No country would argue
against them. To study macroeconomic policy around the world, we begin
by comparing standards of living. In keeping with these goals, we also
look at indicators such as unemployment, inflation, and the balance of
trade policies across countries. Remember that every country has had a
diverse set of experiences; therefore although our goals may be similar,
each country may well require macroeconomic policies tailored to its
circumstances.</span>

1.  <span id="bookmark1523">|</span> <span style=" color: #3767B1;">The
    Diversity of Countries and Economies across the World</span><span
    id="bookmark1531">‌</span>

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Analyze GDP per capita as a measure of the diversity of
        international standards of living

    -   Identify what classifies a country as low-income, middle-income,
        or high-income

    -   Explain how geography, demographics, industry structure, and
        economic institutions influence standards of living

          

        <a href="#bookmark432" id="bookmark1532" class="s34">The national economies that comprise the global economy are remarkably diverse. Let us use one key indicator of the standard of living, GDP per capita, to quantify this diversity. You will quickly see that quantifying this diversity is fraught with challenges and limitations. As we explained in</a>
        <a href="#bookmark432" class="a">The Macroeconomic</a>
        Perspective<a href="#bookmark1285" class="s34">, we must consider using purchasing power parity or “international dollars” to convert average incomes into comparable units. Purchasing power parity, as we formally defined in</a>
        <a href="#bookmark1285" class="a">Exchange Rates and International Capital</a>
        Flows<span class="p">, takes into account that prices of the
        same good are different across countries.</span><span
        id="bookmark1533">‌</span>

        <a href="#bookmark432" class="a">The Macroeconomic Perspective</a>
        <a href="#bookmark537" class="s34">explained how to measure GDP, the challenges of using GDP to compare standards of living, and the difficulty of confusing economic size with distribution. In China's case, for example, China ranks as the second largest global economy, second to only the United States, with Japan ranking third. However, when we take China's GDP of $9.2 trillion and divide it by its population of 1.4 billion, then the per capita GDP is only $6,900, which is significantly lower than that of Japan, at $38,500, and that of the United States, at $52,800. Measurement issues aside, it’s worth repeating that the goal, then, is to not only increase GDP, but to strive toward increased GDP per capita to increase overall living standards for individuals. As we have learned from</a>
        <a href="#bookmark537" class="a">Economic</a> Growth<span
        class="p">, countries can achieve this at the national level by
        designing policies that increase worker productivity, deepen
        capital, and advance technology.</span>

        GDP per capita also allows us to rank countries into high-,
        middle-, or low-income groups. Low-income countries are those
        with $1,025 per capita GDP per year; middle-income countries
        have a per capita GDP between $1,025 and

        <a href="#bookmark1534" class="s34">$12,475; while high-income countries have over $12,475 per year per capita income. As</a>
        <a href="#bookmark1534" class="a">Table 19.1</a>
        <a href="#bookmark1535" class="s34">and</a>
        [Figure](#bookmark1535)

2.  show, high-income countries earn 68% of world income, but represent
    just 12% of the global population. Low- income countries earn 1% of
    total world income, but represent 18.5% of global population.

<a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/standofliving" class="s84">Economists know that there are many factors that contribute to your standard of living. People in high-income countries may have very little time due to heavy workloads and may feel disconnected from their community. Lower-income countries may be more community centered, but have little in the way of material wealth.</a>
It is hard to measure these characteristics of standard of living. The
Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development has developed the
“OECD Better Life Index.” Visit this
<a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/" class="s41">website</a>
<a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/standofliving" class="s41">(http://openstaxcollege.org/ l/standofliving)</a>
to see how countries measure up to your expected standard of living.

<span id="bookmark1538">Such comparisons between regions are admittedly
rough. After all, per capita GDP cannot fully capture the quality of
life. Many other factors have a large impact on the standard of living,
like health, education, human rights, crime and personal safety, and
environmental quality. These measures also reveal very wide differences
in the standard of living across the regions of the world. Much of this
is correlated with per capita income, but there are exceptions. For
example, life expectancy at birth in many low-income regions
approximates those who are more affluent. The data also illustrate that
nobody can claim to have perfect standards of living. For instance,
despite very high income levels, there is still undernourishment in
Europe and North America.</span>

<span id="bookmark1539">The differences in economic statistics and other
measures of well-being, substantial though they are, do not fully
capture the reasons for the enormous differences between countries.
Aside from the neoclassical determinants of growth, four additional
determinants are significant in a wide range of statistical studies and
are worth mentioning: geography, demography, industrial structure, and
institutions.</span>

Geographic and Demographic Differences

Countries have geographic differences: some have extensive coastlines,
some are landlocked. Some have large rivers that have been a path of
commerce for centuries, or mountains that have been a barrier to trade.
Some have deserts, some have rain forests. These differences create
different positive and negative opportunities for commerce, health, and
the environment.

Countries also have considerable differences in the age distribution of
the population. Many high-income nations are approaching a situation by
2020 or so in which the elderly will form a much larger share of the
population. Most low- income countries still have a higher proportion of
youth and young adults, but by about 2050, the elderly populations in
these low-income countries are expected to boom as well. These
demographic changes will have considerable impact on the standard of
living of the young and the old.

Differences in Industry Structure and Economic Institutions

Countries have differences in industry structure. In the world's
high-income economies, only about 2% of GDP comes from agriculture; the
average for the rest of the world is 12%. Countries have strong
differences in degree of urbanization.

Countries also have strong differences in economic institutions: some
nations have economies that are extremely market-oriented, while other
nations have command economies. Some nations are open to international
trade, while others use tariffs and import quotas to limit the impact of
trade. Some nations are torn by long-standing armed conflicts; other
nations are largely at peace. There are also differences in political,
religious, and social institutions.

No nation intentionally aims for a low standard of living, high rates of
unemployment and inflation, or an unsustainable trade imbalance.
However, nations will differ in their priorities and in the situations
in which they find themselves, and so their policy choices can
reasonably vary, too. The next modules will discuss how nations around
the world, from high income to low income, approach the four
macroeconomic goals of economic growth, low unemployment, low inflation,
and a sustainable balance of trade.

    -   Analyze the growth policies of low-income countries seeking to
        improve standards of living

    -   Analyze the growth policies of middle-income countries,
        particularly the East Asian Tigers with their focus on
        technology and market-oriented incentives

        <span id="bookmark1541">Jobs are created in economies that grow.
        What is the origin of economic growth? According to most
        economists who believe in the</span> **growth
        consensus**<a href="#bookmark537" class="s34">, economic growth (as we discussed in</a>
        <a href="#bookmark537" class="a">Economic</a> <span
        class="s54">Growth</span>) is built on a foundation

          

          

        <a href="#bookmark1537" class="s34">of productivity improvements. In turn, productivity increases are the result of greater human and physical capital and technology, all interacting in a market-driven economy. In the pursuit of economic growth, however, some countries and regions start from different levels, as the differences in per capita GDP presented earlier in</a>
        <a href="#bookmark1537" class="a">Table 19.2</a> <span
        class="p">illustrate.</span>

        Growth Policies for the High-Income Countries

        <a href="#bookmark856" class="s34">For the high-income countries, the challenge of economic growth is to push continually for a more educated workforce that can create, invest in, and apply new technologies. In effect, the goal of their growth-oriented public policy is to shift their aggregate supply curves to the right (refer to</a>
        <a href="#bookmark856" class="a">The Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply</a>
        Model<span class="p">). The main public policies targeted at
        achieving this goal are fiscal policies focused on investment,
        including investment in human capital, in technology, and in
        physical plant and equipment. These countries also recognize
        that economic growth works best in a stable and market-oriented
        economic climate. For this reason, they use monetary policy to
        keep inflation low and stable, and to minimize the risk of
        exchange rate fluctuations, while also encouraging domestic and
        international competition.</span>

        However, early in the second decade of the 2000s, many
        high-income countries found themselves more focused on the short
        term than on the long term. The United States, Western Europe,
        and Japan all experienced a combination of financial crisis and
        deep recession, and the after-effects of the recession—like high
        unemployment rates—seemed likely to linger for several years.
        Most of these governments took aggressive, and in some cases
        controversial, steps to jump-start their economies by running
        very large budget deficits as part of expansionary fiscal
        policy. These countries must adopt a course that combines lower
        government spending and higher taxes.

        <a href="#bookmark1542" class="s34">Similarly, many central banks ran highly expansionary monetary policies, with both near-zero interest rates and unconventional loans and investments. For example, in 2012, Shinzo Abe (see</a>
        <a href="#bookmark1542" class="a">Figure</a> <span
        class="s54">19.4</span>), then newly-elected Prime Minister of
        Japan, unveiled a plan to pull his country out of its
        two-decade-long slump in economic growth. It included both
        fiscal stimulus and an increase in the money supply. The plan
        was quite successful in the short run. However, according to the
        *Economist*, with public debt “expected to approach 240% of
        GDP,” (as of 2012 it was 226% of GDP) printing money and
        public-works spending were only short-term solutions.

        As we discussed in other chapters, macroeconomics needs to have
        both a short-run and a long-run focus. The challenge for many of
        the developed countries in the next few years will be to exit
        from the short-term policies that they used to correct the
        2008–2009 recession. Since the return to growth has been
        sluggish, it has been politically challenging for these
        governments to refocus their efforts on new technology,
        education, and physical capital investment.

        Growth Policies for the Middle-Income Economies

        <span id="bookmark1543">The world’s great economic success
        stories in the last few decades began in the 1970s with that
        group of nations sometimes known as the</span> **East Asian
        Tigers**: South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and
        Singapore. The list sometimes includes Hong Kong and Taiwan,
        although often under international law they are treated as part
        of China, rather than as separate countries. The economic growth
        of the Tigers has been phenomenal, typically averaging 5.5% real
        per capita growth for several decades. In the 1980s, other
        countries began to show signs of convergence. China began
        growing rapidly, often at annual rates of 8% to 10% per year.
        India began growing rapidly, first at rates of about 5% per year
        in the 1990s, but then higher still in the first decade of the
        2000s.

        We know the underlying causes of these rapid growth rates:

          

          

    -   China and the East Asian Tigers, in particular, have been among
        the highest savers in the world, often saving one-third or more
        of GDP as compared to the roughly one-fifth of GDP, which would
        be a more typical saving rate in Latin America and Africa. These
        countries harnessed higher savings for domestic investment to
        build physical capital.

    -   These countries had policies that supported heavy investments in
        human capital, first building up primary- level education and
        then expanding secondary-level education. Many focused on
        encouraging math and science education, which is useful in
        engineering and business.

    -   Governments made a concerted effort to seek out applicable
        technology, by sending students and government commissions
        abroad to look at the most efficient industrial operations
        elsewhere. They also created policies to support innovative
        companies that wished to build production facilities to take
        advantage of the abundant and inexpensive human capital.

    -   China and India in particular also allowed far greater freedom
        for market forces, both within their own domestic economies and
        also in encouraging their firms to participate in world markets.

        <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_397.png" width="624" height="51" alt="image" />

        What is the rule of 72?

        It is worth pausing a moment to marvel at the East Asian Tigers'
        growth rates. If per capita GDP grows at, say, 6% per year, then
        you can apply the formula for compound growth rates—that is (1 +
        0.06)<span class="s65">30</span>—meaning a nation’s level of per
        capita GDP will rise by a multiple of almost six over 30 years.
        Another strategy is to apply the rule of 72. The rule of 72 is
        an approximation to figure out doubling time. We divide the rule
        number, 72, by the annual growth rate to obtain the approximate
        number of years it will take for income to double. If we have a
        6% growth rate, it will take 72/6, or 12 years, for incomes to
        double. Using this rule here suggests that a Tiger that grows at
        6% will double its GDP every 12 years. In contrast, a
        technological leader, chugging along with per capita growth
        rates of about 2% per year, would double its income in 36 years.

        <span id="bookmark1544">This combination of technology, human
        capital, and physical capital, combined with the incentives of a
        market- oriented economic context, proved an extremely powerful
        stimulant to growth. Challenges that these middle-income
        countries faced are a legacy of government economic controls
        that for political reasons can be dismantled only slowly over
        time. In many of them, the government heavily regulates the
        banking and financial sector. Governments have also sometimes
        selected certain industries to receive low-interest loans or
        government subsidies. These economies have found that an
        increased dose of market-oriented incentives for firms and
        workers has been a critical ingredient in the recipe for faster
        growth. To learn more about measuring economic growth, read the
        following Clear It Up feature.</span>

          

          

        Growth Policies for Economically-Challenged Countries

        Many economically-challenged or low-income countries are
        geographically located in Sub-Saharan Africa. Other pockets of
        low income are in the former Soviet Bloc, and in parts of
        Central America and the Caribbean.

        There are macroeconomic policies and prescriptions that might
        alleviate the extreme poverty and low standard of living.
        However, many of these countries lack the economic and legal
        stability, along with market-oriented institutions, needed to
        provide a fertile climate for domestic economic growth and to
        attract foreign investment. Thus, macroeconomic policies for low
        income economies are vastly different from those of the high
        income economies. The World Bank has made it a priority to
        combat poverty and raise overall income levels through 2030. One
        of the key obstacles to achieving this is the political
        instability that seems to be a common feature of low-income
        countries.

        <a href="#bookmark1545" class="a">Figure 19.5</a> <span
        class="p">shows the ten lowest income countries as ranked by The
        World Bank in 2013. These countries share some common traits,
        the most significant of which is the recent failures of their
        governments to provide a legal framework for economic growth.
        Ethiopia and Eritrea recently ended a long-standing war in 2000.
        Civil and ethnic wars have plagued countries such as Burundi and
        Liberia. Command economies, corruption, as well as political
        factionalism and infighting are commonly adopted elements in
        these low-income countries. The Democratic Republic of the Congo
        (often referred to as “Congo”) is a resource-wealthy country
        that has not been able to increase its subsistence standard of
        living due to the political environment.</span>

          

        <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_398.jpg" width="398" height="243" alt="image" />

        <span id="bookmark1545">Figure 19.5 The Ten Lowest Income
        Countries</span>
        <a href="http://databank.worldbank.org/data/views/reports/" class="s84">This bar chart that shows ten low-income countries, which include, from lowest income to highest: Democratic Republic of the Congo, Zimbabwe, Burundi, Liberia, Eritrea, Central African Republic, Niger, Madagascar, and Afghanistan.

        map.aspx\#)</span>

          

        <span id="bookmark1546">Low-income countries are at a
        disadvantage because any incomes that people receive are spent
        immediately on necessities such as food. People in these
        countries live on less than $1,035 per year, which is less than
        $100 per month. Lack of saving means a lack of capital
        accumulation and a lack of loanable funds for investment in
        physical and human capital. Recent research by two MIT
        economists, Abhijit Bannerjee and Esther Duflo, has confirmed
        that the households in these economies are trapped in low
        incomes because they cannot muster enough investment to push
        themselves out of poverty.</span>

        <a href="#bookmark1547" class="s34">For example, the average citizen of Burundi, the lowest-income country, subsists on $150 per year (adjusted to 2005 dollars). According to Central Intelligence Agency data in its CIA Factbook, as of 2013, 90% of Burundi’s population is agrarian, with coffee and tea as the main income producing crop. Only one in two children attends school and, as</a>
        <a href="#bookmark1547" class="a">Figure</a> 19.6 <span
        class="p">shows, many are not in schools comparable to what
        occurs in developed countries. The CIA Factbook also estimates
        that 15% of Burundi’s population suffers from HIV/AIDS.
        Political instability has made it difficult for Burundi to make
        significant headway toward growth, as verified by the
        electrification of only 2% of households and 42% of its national
        income coming from foreign aid.</span>

        Other low-income countries share similar stories. These
        countries have found it difficult to generate investments for
        themselves or to find foreign investors willing to put up the
        money for more than the basic needs. Foreign aid and external
        investment comprise significant portions of the income in these
        economies, but are not sufficient to allow for the capital
        accumulation necessary to invest in physical and human capital.
        However, is foreign aid always a contributor to economic growth?
        It can be a controversial issue, as the next Clear it Up feature
        points out.

          

        Does foreign aid to low-income countries work?

        According to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and
        Development (OECD), about $134 billion per year in foreign aid
        flows from the high-income countries of the world to the
        low-income ones. Relative to the size of their populations or
        economies, this is not a large amount for either donors or
        recipients. For low- income countries, aid averages about 1.3
        percent of their GDP. However, even this relatively small amount
        has been highly controversial.

        Supporters of additional foreign aid point to the extraordinary
        human suffering in the world's low-and middle- income countries.
        They see opportunities all across Africa, Asia, and Latin
        America to set up health clinics and schools. They want to help
        with the task of building economic infrastructure: clean water,
        plumbing, electricity, and roads. Supporters of this aid include
        formal state-sponsored institutions like the United Kingdom’s
        Department for International Development (DFID) or independent
        non-governmental organizations (NGOs) like CARE International
        that also receive donor government funds. For example, because
        of an outbreak of meningitis in Ethiopia in 2010, DFID channeled
        significant funds to the Ethiopian Ministry of Health to train
        rural health care workers and also for vaccines. These monies
        helped the Ministry offset shortfalls in their budget.

        Opponents of increased aid do not quarrel with the goal of
        reducing human suffering, but they suggest that foreign aid has
        often proved a poor tool for advancing that goal. For example,
        according to an article in the *Attaché Journal of International
        Affairs*, the Canadian foreign aid organization (CIDA) provided
        $100 million to Tanzania to grow wheat. The project did produce
        wheat, but nomadic pastoralists and other villagers who had
        lived on the land were driven off 100,000 acres of land to make
        way for the project. The damage in terms of human rights and
        lost livelihoods was significant. Villagers were beaten and
        killed because some refused to leave the land. At times, the
        unintended collateral damage from foreign aid can be
        significant.

        William Easterly, professor of economics at New York University
        and author of *The White Man’s Burden*, argues that countries
        often receive aid for political reasons and ends up doing more
        harm than good. If a country's government creates a reasonably
        stable and market-oriented macroeconomic climate, then foreign
        investors will be likely to provide funds for many profitable
        activities. For example, according to *The New York Times*,
        Facebook is partnering with multiple organizations in a project
        called Internet.org to provide access in remote and low-income
        areas of the world, and Google began its own initiative called
        Project Loon.

          

        Facebook’s first forays into providing internet access via
        mobile phones began in stable, market-oriented countries like
        India, Brazil, Indonesia, Turkey, and the Philippines.

        Policymakers are now wiser about foreign aid limitations than
        they were a few decades ago. In targeted and specific cases,
        especially if foreign aid is channeled to long-term investment
        projects, foreign aid can have a modest role to play in reducing
        the extreme levels of deprivation that hundreds of millions of
        people around the world experience.

    style=" color: #3767B1;">Causes of Unemployment around the
    World</span><span id="bookmark1548">‌</span>

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Explain the nature and causes of unemployment

    -   Analyze the natural rate of unemployment and the factors that
        affect it

    -   Identify how undeveloped labor markets can result in the same
        hardships as unemployment

          

        We can categorize the causes of unemployment in the world's
        high-income countries in two ways: either cyclical unemployment
        caused by the economy when in a recession, or the natural rate
        of unemployment caused by factors in labor markets, such as
        government regulations regarding hiring and starting businesses.

        Unemployment from a Recession

        <span id="bookmark1549">For unemployment caused by a recession,
        the Keynesian economic model points out that both monetary and
        fiscal policy tools are available. The monetary policy
        prescription for dealing with recession is straightforward: run
        an expansionary monetary policy to increase the quantity of
        money and loans, drive down interest rates, and increase
        aggregate demand. In a recession, there is usually relatively
        little danger of inflation taking off, and so even a central
        bank, with fighting inflation as its top priority, can usually
        justify some reduction in interest rates.</span><span
        id="bookmark1550">‌</span><span id="bookmark1551">‌</span>

        <a href="#bookmark1384" id="bookmark1552" class="s34">With regard to fiscal policy, the automatic stabilizers that we discussed in</a>
        <a href="#bookmark1384" class="a">Government Budgets and Fiscal</a>
        Policy <span class="p">should be allowed to work, even if this
        means larger budget deficits in times of recession. There is
        less agreement over whether, in addition to automatic
        stabilizers, governments in a recession should try to adopt
        discretionary fiscal policy of additional tax cuts or spending
        increases. In the case of the Great Recession, the case for this
        kind of extra-aggressive expansionary fiscal policy is stronger,
        but for a smaller recession, given the time lags of implementing
        fiscal policy, countries should use discretionary fiscal policy
        with caution.</span><span id="bookmark1553">‌</span>

        However, the aftermath of the Recession emphasizes that
        expansionary fiscal and monetary policies do not turn off a
        recession like flipping a switch turns off a lamp. Even after a
        recession is officially over, and positive growth has returned,
        it can take some months—or even a couple of years—before
        private-sector firms believe the economic climate is healthy
        enough that they can expand their workforce.

          

        The Natural Rate of Unemployment

        <span id="bookmark1554">Unemployment rates in European nations
        have typically been higher than in the United States. In 2006,
        before the start of the Great Recession, the U.S. unemployment
        rate was 4.6%, compared with 9% in France, 10.4% in Germany, and
        7.1% in Sweden. We can attribute the pattern of generally higher
        unemployment rates in Europe, which dates back to the 1970s, to
        the fact that European economies have a higher natural rate of
        unemployment because they have a greater number of rules and
        restrictions that discourage firms from hiring and unemployed
        workers from taking jobs.</span>

        Addressing the natural rate of unemployment is straightforward
        in theory but difficult in practice. Government can play a
        useful role in providing unemployment and welfare payments, for
        example, by passing rules about where and when businesses can
        operate, and assuring that the workplace is safe. However, these
        well-intentioned laws can, in some cases, become so intrusive
        that businesses decide to place limits on their hiring.

        For example, a law that imposes large costs on a business that
        tries to fire or lay off workers will mean that businesses try
        to avoid hiring in the first place, as is the case in France.
        According to *Business Week*, “France has 2.4 times as many
        companies with 49 employees as with 50 ... according to the
        French labor code, once a company has at least 50 employees
        inside France, management must create three worker councils,
        introduce profit sharing, and submit restructuring plans to the
        councils if the company decides to fire workers for economic
        reasons.” This labor law essentially limits employment (or
        raises the natural rate of unemployment).

        Undeveloped Labor Markets

        Low-income and middle-income countries face employment issues
        that go beyond unemployment as it is understood in the
        high-income economies. A substantial number of workers in these
        economies provide many of their own needs by farming, fishing,
        or hunting. They barter and trade with others and may take a
        succession of short-term or one-day jobs, sometimes receiving
        pay with food or shelter, sometimes with money. They are not
        “unemployed” in the sense that we use the term in the United
        States and Europe, but neither are they employed in a regular
        wage-paying job.

        <a href="#bookmark14" class="s34">The starting point of economic activity, as we discussed in</a>
        <a href="#bookmark14" class="a">Welcome to</a> Economics!<span
        class="p">, is the division of labor, in which workers
        specialize in certain tasks and trade the fruits of their labor
        with others. Workers who are not connected to a labor market are
        often unable to specialize very much. Because these workers are
        not “officially” employed, they are often not eligible for
        social benefits like unemployment insurance or old-age
        payments—if such payments are even available in their country.
        Helping these workers to become more connected to the labor
        market and the economy is an important policy goal. Recent
        research by development economists suggests that one of the key
        factors in raising people in low-income countries out of the
        worst kind of poverty is whether they can make a connection to a
        somewhat regular wage-paying job.</span>

3.  <span id="bookmark1526">|</span> <span
    style=" color: #3767B1;">Causes of Inflation in Various Countries
    and Regions</span><span id="bookmark1555">‌</span>

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Identify the causes and effects of inflation in various economic
        markets

    -   Explain the significance of a converging economy

          

        <span id="bookmark1556">Policymakers of the high-income
        economies appear to have learned some lessons about fighting
        inflation. First, whatever happens with aggregate supply and
        aggregate demand in the short run, countries can use monetary
        policy to prevent inflation from becoming entrenched in the
        economy in the medium and long term. Second, there is no
        long-run gain to letting inflation become established. In fact,
        allowing inflation to become lasting and persistent poses
        undesirable risks and tradeoffs. When inflation is high,
        businesses and individuals need to spend time and effort
        worrying about protecting themselves against inflation, rather
        than seeking better ways to serve customers. In short, the
        high-income economies appear to have both a political consensus
        to hold inflation low and the economic tools to do so.</span>

        In a number of middle- and low-income economies around the
        world, inflation is far from a solved problem. In the early
        2000s, Turkey experienced inflation of more than 50% per year
        for several years. Belarus had inflation of about 100% per year
        from 2000 to 2001. From 2008 to 2010, Venezuela and Myanmar had
        inflation rates of 20% to 30%

          

          

        per year. Indonesia, Iran, Nigeria, the Russian Federation, and
        Ukraine all had double-digit inflation for most of the years
        from 2000 to 2010. Zimbabwe had hyperinflation, with inflation
        rates that went from more than 100% per year in the mid-2000s to
        a rate of several million percent in 2008.

        In these countries, the problem of very high inflation generally
        arises from huge budget deficits, which the government finances
        by printing its domestic currency. This is a case of “too much
        money chasing too few goods.” In the case of Zimbabwe, the
        government covered its widening deficits by printing ever higher
        currency notes, including a $100 trillion bill. By late 2008,
        the money was nearly worthless, which led Zimbabwe to adopt the
        U.S. dollar, immediately halting their hyperinflation. In some
        countries, the central bank makes loans to politically favored
        firms, essentially printing money to do so, and this too leads
        to higher inflation.

        <span id="bookmark1557">A number of countries have managed to
        sustain solid levels of economic growth for sustained periods of
        time with inflation levels that would sound high by recent U.S.
        standards, like 10% to 30% per year. In such economies, the
        governments index most contracts, wage levels, and interest
        rates to inflation. Indexing wage contracts and interest rates
        means that they will increase when inflation increases to retain
        purchasing power. When wages do not rise as price levels rise,
        this leads to a decline in the real wage rate and a decrease in
        the standard of living. Likewise, interest rates that are not
        indexed mean that money lenders will receive payment in devalued
        currency and will also lose purchasing power on monies that they
        lent. It is clearly possible—and perhaps sometimes necessary—for
        a</span> **converging economy** (the economy of a country that
        demonstrates the ability to catch up to the technology leaders)
        to live with a degree of uncertainty over inflation that would
        be politically unacceptable in the high-income economies.

          

4.  <span id="bookmark1527">|</span> <span
    style=" color: #3767B1;">Balance of Trade Concerns</span><span
    id="bookmark1558">‌</span>

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Explain the meaning of trade balance and its implications for
        the foreign exchange market

    -   Analyze concerns over international trade in goods and services
        and international flows of capital

    -   Identify and evaluate market-oriented economic reforms

  

In the 1950s and 1960s, and even into the 1970s, low- and middle-income
countries often viewed openness to global flows of goods, services, and
financial capital in a negative light. These countries feared that
foreign trade would mean both economic losses as high-income trading
partners "exploited" their economy and they lost domestic political
control to powerful business interests and multinational corporations.

<span id="bookmark1559">These negative feelings about international
trade have evolved. After all, the great economic success stories of
recent years like Japan, the East Asian Tiger economies, China, and
India, all took advantage of opportunities to sell in global markets.
European economies thrive with high levels of trade. In the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the United States, Canada, and
Mexico pledged themselves to reduce trade barriers. Many countries have
clearly learned that reducing barriers to trade is at least potentially
beneficial to the economy. Many smaller world economies have learned an
even tougher lesson: if they do not participate actively in world trade,
they are unlikely to join the success stories among the converging
economies. There are no examples in world history of small economies
that remained apart from the global economy but still attained a high
standard of living.</span>

Although almost every country now claims that its goal is to participate
in global trade, the possible negative consequences have remained highly
controversial. It is useful to divide these possible negative
consequences into issues involving trade of goods and services and
issues involving international capital flows. These issues are related,
but not the same. An economy may have a high level of trade in goods and
services relative to GDP, but if exports and imports are balanced, the
net flow of foreign investment in and out of the economy will be zero.
Conversely, an economy may have only a moderate level of trade relative
to GDP, but find that it has a substantial current account trade
imbalance. Thus, it is useful to consider the concerns over
international trade of goods and services and international flows of
financial capital separately.

Concerns over International Trade in Goods and Services

<a href="#bookmark780" class="s34">There is a long list of worries about foreign trade in goods and services: fear of job loss, environmental dangers, unfair labor practices, and many other concerns. We discuss these arguments at some length in the chapter on</a>
<a href="#bookmark780" class="a">The International Trade and Capital</a>
Flows<span class="p">.</span>

Of all of the arguments for limitations on trade, perhaps the most
controversial one among economists is the

  

  

<a href="#bookmark1659" id="bookmark1560" class="s34">infant industry argument; that is, subsidizing or protecting new industries for a time until they become established. (</a><a href="#bookmark1659" class="a">Globalization and Protectionism</a>
<span class="p">explains this concept in more detail.) Countries have
used such policies with some success at certain points in time, but in
the world as a whole, support for key industries is far more often
directed at long-established industries with substantial political power
that are suffering losses and laying off workers, rather than
potentially vibrant new industries that are not yet established. If
government intends to favor certain industries, it needs to do so in a
way that is temporary and that orients them toward a future of market
competition, rather than a future of unending government subsidies and
trade protection.</span>

Concerns over International Flows of Capital

<a href="#bookmark432" id="bookmark1561" class="s34">Recall from</a>
<a href="#bookmark432" class="a">The Macroeconomic Perspective</a> <span
class="p">that a trade deficit exists when a nation’s imports exceed its
exports. In order for a trade deficit to take place, foreign countries
must provide loans or investments, which they are willing to do because
they expect eventual repayment (that the deficit will become a surplus).
A trade surplus, you may remember, exists when a nation’s exports exceed
its imports. Thus, in order for a trade deficit to switch to a trade
surplus, a nation’s exports must rise and its imports must fall.
Sometimes this happens when the currency decreases in value. For
example, if the U.S. had a trade deficit and the dollar depreciated,
imports would become more expensive. This would, in turn, benefit the
foreign countries that provided the loans or investments.</span><span
id="bookmark1562">‌</span>

The expected pattern of trade imbalances in the world economy has been
that high-income economies will run trade surpluses, which means they
will experience a net outflow of capital to foreign destinations or
export more than they import, while low- and middle-income economies
will run trade deficits, which means that they will experience a net
inflow of foreign capital.

This international investing pattern can benefit all sides. Investors in
the high-income countries benefit because they can receive high returns
on their investments, and also because they can diversify their
investments so that they are at less risk of a downturn in their own
domestic economy. The low-income economies that receive an inflow of
capital presumably have potential for rapid catch-up economic growth,
and they can use the international financial capital inflow to help spur
their physical capital investment. In addition, financial capital
inflows often come with management abilities, technological expertise,
and training.

<a href="#bookmark780" id="bookmark1563" class="s34">However, for the last couple of decades, this cheerful scenario has faced two “dark clouds.” The first cloud is the very large trade or current account deficits in the U.S. economy. (See</a>
<a href="#bookmark780" class="a">The International Trade and Capital</a>
Flows<span class="p">.) Instead of offering net financial investment
abroad, the U.S. economy is soaking up savings from all over the world.
These substantial U.S. trade deficits may not be sustainable according
to Sebastian Edwards writing for the National Bureau of Economic
Research. While trade deficits on their own are not bad, the question is
whether governments will reduce them gradually or hastily. In the
gradual scenario, U.S. exports could grow more rapidly than imports over
a period of years, aided U.S. dollar depreciation. An unintended
consequence of the slow growth since the Great Recession has been a
decline in the U.S. current account deficit's from 6% pre-recession to
3% most recently.</span>

The other option is that the government could reduce the U.S. trade
deficit in a rush. Here is one scenario: if foreign investors became
less willing to hold U.S. dollar assets, the dollar exchange rate could
weaken. As speculators see this process happening, they might rush to
unload their dollar assets, which would drive the dollar down still
further.

<span id="bookmark1564">A lower U.S. dollar would stimulate aggregate
demand by making exports cheaper and imports more expensive. It would
mean higher prices for imported inputs throughout the economy, shifting
the short-term aggregate supply curve to the left. The result could be a
burst of inflation and, if the Federal Reserve were to run a tight
monetary policy to reduce the inflation, it could also lead to
recession. People sometimes talk as if the U.S. economy, with its great
size, is invulnerable to this sort of pressure from international
markets. While it is difficult to rock, it is not impossible for the $17
trillion U.S. economy to face these international pressures.</span>

The second “dark cloud” is how the smaller world economies should deal
with the possibility of sudden foreign financial capital inflows and
outflows. Perhaps the most vivid recent example of the potentially
destructive forces of international capital movements occurred in the
East Asian Tiger economies in 1997–1998. Thanks to their excellent
growth performance over the previous few decades, these economies had
attracted considerable interest from foreign investors. In the
mid-1990s, however, foreign investment into these countries surged even
further. Much of this money funneled through banks that borrowed in U.S.
dollars and loaned in their national currencies. Bank lending surged at
rates of 20% per year or more. This inflow of foreign capital meant that
investment in these economies exceeded the level of domestic savings, so
that current account deficits in these countries jumped into the 5–10%
GDP range.

The surge in bank lending meant that many banks in these East Asian
countries did not do an especially good job of screening out safe and
unsafe borrowers. Many of the loans—as high as 10% to 15% of all loans
in some of these

  

  

countries—started to turn bad. Fearing losses, foreign investors started
pulling out their money. As the foreign money left, the exchange rates
of these countries crashed, often falling by 50% or more in a few
months. The banks were stuck with a mismatch: even if the rest of their
domestic loans were repaid, they could never pay back the U.S. dollars
that they owed. The banking sector as a whole went bankrupt. The lack of
credit and lending in the economy collapsed aggregate demand, bringing
on a deep recession.

<a href="#bookmark1565" class="s34">If the flow and ebb of international capital markets can flip even the economies of the East Asian Tigers, with their stellar growth records, into a recession, then it is no wonder that other middle- and low-income countries around the world are concerned. Moreover, similar episodes of an inflow and then an outflow of foreign financial capital have rocked a number of economies around the world: for example, in the last few years, economies like Ireland, Iceland, and Greece have all experienced severe shocks when foreign lenders decided to stop extending funds. Especially in Greece, this caused the government to enact austerity measures which led to protests throughout the country (</a><a href="#bookmark1565" class="a">Figure</a>
19.7<span class="p">).</span>

Great Recession such that the government had to enact austerity
measures, (strict rules) cutting wages and increasing taxes on its
population. Massive protests are but one byproduct. (Credit:

Many nations are taking steps to reduce the risk that their economy will
be injured if foreign financial capital takes flight, including having
their central banks hold large reserves of foreign exchange and stepping
up their regulation of domestic banks to avoid a wave of imprudent
lending. The most controversial steps in this area involve whether
countries should try to take steps to control or reduce the flows of
foreign capital. If a country could discourage some speculative
short-term capital inflow, and instead only encourage investment capital
that it committed for the medium and the long term, then it could be at
least somewhat less susceptible to swings in the sentiments of global
investors.

<span id="bookmark1566">If economies participate in the global trade of
goods and services, they will also need to participate in international
flows of financial payments and investments. These linkages can offer
great benefits to an economy. However, any nation that is experiencing a
substantial and sustained pattern of trade deficits, along with the
corresponding net inflow of international financial capital, has some
reason for concern. During the Asian Financial Crisis in the late 1990s,
countries that grew dramatically in the years leading up to the crisis
as international capital flowed in, saw their economies collapse when
the capital very quickly flowed out.</span>

Market-Oriented Economic Reforms

<a href="#bookmark1567" class="s34">The standard of living has increased dramatically for billions of people around the world in the last half century. Such increases have occurred not only in the technological leaders like the United States, Canada, the nations of Europe, and Japan, but also in the East Asian Tigers and in many nations of Latin America and Eastern Europe. The challenge for most of these countries is to maintain these growth rates. The economically-challenged regions of the world have stagnated and become stuck in poverty traps. These countries need to focus on the basics: health and education, or human capital development. As</a>

education and human capital development in ways that would have not been
possible just a few short years ago.</span>

Youth Unemployment: Three Cases

Spain and South Africa had the same high youth unemployment in 2011, but
the reasons for this unemployment are different. Spain’s youth
unemployment surged due to the 2008-2009 Great Recession and heavy
indebtedness on the part of its citizens and its government. Spain’s
current account balance is negative, which means it is borrowing
heavily. To cure cyclical unemployment during a recession, the Keynesian
model suggests increases in government spending—fiscal expansion or
monetary expansion. Neither option is open to Spain. It currently can
borrow at only high interest rates, which will be a real problem in
terms of debt service. In addition, the rest of the European Union (EU)
has dragged its feet when it comes to debt forgiveness. Monetary
expansion is not possible because Spain uses the euro and cannot devalue
its currency unless it convinces all of the EU to do so. What can be
done? The *Economist*, summarizing some ideas of economists and
policymakers, suggests that Spain’s only realistic (although painful)
option is to reduce government-mandated wages, which would allow it to
reduce government spending. As a result, the government would be able to
lower tax rates on the working population. With a lower wage or lower
tax environment, firms will hire more workers. This will lower
unemployment and stimulate the economy. Spain can also encourage greater
foreign investment and try to promote policies that encourage domestic
savings.

South Africa has more of a natural rate of unemployment problem. It is
an interesting case because its youth unemployment is mostly because its
young are not ready to work. Economists commonly refer to this as an
employability problem. According to interviews of South African firms as
reported in the *Economist*, the young are academically smart but lack
practical skills for the workplace. Despite a big push to increase
investment in human capital, the results have not yet borne fruit.
Recently the government unveiled a plan to pay unemployed youth while
they were “trained-up” or apprenticed in South African firms. The
government

Other than the issue of economic growth, the other three main goals of
macroeconomic policy—that is, low unemployment, low inflation, and a
sustainable balance of trade—all involve situations in which, for some
reason, the economy fails to coordinate the forces of supply and demand.
In the case of cyclical unemployment, for example, the intersection of
aggregate supply and aggregate demand occurs at a level of output below
potential GDP. In the case of the natural rate of unemployment,
government regulations create a situation where otherwise-willing
employers become unwilling to hire otherwise-willing workers. Inflation
is a situation in which aggregate demand outstrips aggregate supply, at
least for a time, so that too much buying power is chasing too few
goods. A trade imbalance is a situation where, because of a net inflow
or outflow of foreign capital, domestic savings are not aligned with
domestic investment. Each of these situations can create a range of
easier or harder policy choices.

  

  

has room to increase fiscal expenditure, encourage domestic savings, and
continue to fund investment in education, vocational training, and
apprentice programs. South Africa can also improve the climate for
foreign investment from technology leaders, which would encourage
economic growth.

India has a smaller youth employment problem in terms of percentages.
However, bear in mind that since this is a populous country, it turns
out to be a significant problem in raw numbers. According to Kaushik
Basu, writing for the BBC, “there are 45 national laws governing the
hiring and firing decisions of firms and close to four times that amount
at the state level”. These laws make it difficult for companies to fire
workers. To stay nimble and responsive to markets, Indian companies
respond to these laws by hiring fewer workers. The Indian government can
do much to solve this problem by adjusting its labor laws. Essentially,
the government has to remove itself from firms’ hiring and firing
decisions, so that growing Indian firms can freely employ more workers.
Indian workers, like those in South Africa, do not have workforce
skills. Again, the government can increase its spending on education,
vocational training, and workforce readiness programs.

Finally, India has a significant current account deficit. This deficit
is mainly a result of short- and long-term capital flows. To solve this
deficit, India has experimented by lifting the limitation on domestic
savers from investing abroad. This is a step in the right direction that
may dampen the growth in the current account deficit. A final policy
possibility is to improve domestic capital markets so many self-employed
Indians can obtain access to capital to realize their business ideas. If
more Indians can obtain access to capital to start businesses,
employment might increase.

KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY

  

1.  <a href="#bookmark1531" class="a">The Diversity of Countries and Economies across the</a>
    [World](#bookmark1531)

    Macroeconomic policy goals for most countries strive toward low
    levels of unemployment and inflation, as well as stable trade
    balances. Economists analyze countries based on their GDP per person
    and ranked as low-, middle-

    , and high-income countries. Low-income are those earning less than
    $1,025 (less than 1%) of global income. They currently have 18.5% of
    the world population. Middle-income countries are those with per
    capital income of

    $1,025–$12,475 (31.1% of global income). They have 69.5% of world
    population. High-income countries are those with per capita income
    greater than $12,475 (68.3% of global income). They have 12% of the
    world’s population. Regional comparisons tend to be inaccurate
    because even countries within those regions tend to differ from each
    other.

      

2.  <a href="#bookmark1540" class="a">Improving Countries’ Standards of</a>
    [Living](#bookmark1540)

    The fundamentals of growth are the same in every country:
    improvements in human capital, physical capital, and technology
    interacting in a market-oriented economy. Countries that are
    high-income tend to focus on developing and using new technology.
    Countries that are middle-income focus on increasing human capital
    and becoming more connected to technology and global markets. They
    have charted unconventional paths by relying more on state-led
    support rather than relying solely on markets. Low-income,
    economically-challenged countries have many health and human
    development needs, but they are also challenged by the lack of
    investment and foreign aid to develop infrastructure like roads.
    There are some bright spots when it comes to financial development
    and mobile communications, which suggest that low-income countries
    can become technology leaders in their own right, but it is too
    early to claim victory. These countries must do more to connect to
    the rest of the global economy and find the technologies that work
    best for them.

      

3.  <a href="#bookmark1548" class="a">Causes of Unemployment around the</a>
    [World](#bookmark1548)

    We can address cyclical unemployment by expansionary fiscal and
    monetary policy. The natural rate of unemployment can be harder to
    solve, because it involves thinking carefully about the tradeoffs
    involved in laws that affect employment and hiring. Unemployment is
    understood differently in high-income countries compared to low- and
    middle-income countries. People in these countries are not
    “unemployed” in the sense that we use the term in the United States
    and Europe, but neither are they employed in a regular wage-paying
    job. While some may have regular wage-paying jobs, others are part
    of a barter economy.

      

4.  <a href="#bookmark1555" class="a">Causes of Inflation in Various Countries and</a>
    [Regions](#bookmark1555)

    Most high-income economies have learned that their central banks can
    control inflation in the medium and the long

      

      

    term. In addition, they have learned that inflation has no long-term
    benefits but potentially substantial long-term costs if it distracts
    businesses from focusing on real productivity gains. However,
    smaller economies around the world may face more volatile inflation
    because their smaller economies can be unsettled by international
    movements of capital and goods.

      

5.  <a href="#bookmark1558" class="a">Balance of Trade</a>
    [Concerns](#bookmark1558)

There are many legitimate concerns over possible negative consequences
of free trade. Perhaps the single strongest response to these concerns
is that there are good ways to address them without restricting trade
and thus losing its benefits. There are two major issues involving trade
imbalances. One is what will happen with the large U.S. trade deficits,
and whether they will come down gradually or with a rush. The other is
whether smaller countries around the world should take some steps to
limit flows of international capital, in the hope that they will not be
quite so susceptible to economic whiplash from international financial
capital flowing in and out of their economies.

Just Whose iPhone Is It?

The iPhone is a global product. Apple does not manufacture the iPhone
components, nor does it assemble them. The assembly is done by Foxconn
Corporation, a Taiwanese company, at its factory in Sengzhen, China.
But, Samsung, the electronics firm and competitor to Apple, actually
supplies many of the parts that make up an iPhone—representing about 26%
of the costs of production. That means, that Samsung is both the biggest
supplier and biggest competitor for Apple. Why do these two firms work
together to produce the iPhone? To understand the economic logic behind
international trade, you have to accept, as these firms do, that trade
is about mutually beneficial exchange. Samsung is one of the world’s
largest electronics parts suppliers. Apple lets Samsung focus on making
the best parts, which allows Apple to concentrate on its
strength—designing elegant products that are easy to use. If each
company (and by extension each country) focuses on what it does best,
there will be gains for all through trade.

#### Introduction to International Trade

In this chapter, you will learn about:

Absolute and Comparative Advantage

  

What Happens When a Country Has an Absolute Advantage in All Goods

Intra-industry Trade between Similar Economies

The Benefits of Reducing Barriers to International Trade

  

We live in a global marketplace. The food on your table might include
fresh fruit from Chile, cheese from France, and bottled water from
Scotland. Your wireless phone might have been made in Taiwan or Korea.
The clothes you wear might be designed in Italy and manufactured in
China. The toys you give to a child might have come from India. The car
you drive might come from Japan, Germany, or Korea. The gasoline in the
tank might be refined from crude oil from Saudi Arabia, Mexico, or
Nigeria. As a worker, if your job is involved with farming, machinery,
airplanes, cars, scientific instruments, or many other
technology-related industries, the odds are good that a hearty
proportion of the sales of your employer—and hence the money that pays
your salary—comes from export sales. We are all linked by international
trade, and the volume of that trade has grown dramatically in the last
few decades.

<span id="bookmark1594">The first wave of globalization started in the
nineteenth century and lasted up to the beginning of World War I. Over
that time, global exports as a share of global GDP rose from less than
1% of GDP in 1820 to 9% of GDP in 1913. As the Nobel Prize-winning
economist Paul Krugman of Princeton University wrote in 1995:</span>

It is a late-twentieth-century conceit that we invented the global
economy just yesterday. In fact, world markets achieved an impressive
degree of integration during the second half of the nineteenth century.
Indeed, if one wants a specific date for the beginning of a truly global
economy, one might well choose 1869, the year in which both the Suez
Canal and the Union Pacific railroad were completed. By the eve of the
First World War steamships and railroads had created markets for
standardized commodities, like wheat and wool, that were fully global in
their reach. Even the global flow of information was better than modern
observers, focused on electronic technology, tend to realize: the first
submarine telegraph cable was laid under the Atlantic in 1858, and by
1900 all of the world’s major economic regions could effectively
communicate instantaneously.

<span id="bookmark1595">This first wave of globalization crashed to a
halt early in the twentieth century. World War I severed many economic
connections. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, many nations
misguidedly tried to fix their own economies by reducing foreign trade
with others. World War II further hindered international trade. Global
flows of goods and financial capital were rebuilt only slowly after
World War II. It was not until the early 1980s that global economic
forces again became as important, relative to the size of the world
economy, as they were before World War I.</span>

    style=" color: #3767B1;">Absolute and Comparative
    Advantage</span><span id="bookmark1596">‌</span>

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Define absolute advantage, comparative advantage, and
        opportunity costs

    -   Explain the gains of trade created when a country specializes

          

        The American statesman Benjamin Franklin (1706–1790) once wrote:
        “No nation was ever ruined by trade.” Many economists would
        express their attitudes toward international trade in an even
        more positive manner. The evidence that international trade
        confers overall benefits on economies is pretty strong. Trade
        has accompanied economic growth in the United States and around
        the world. Many of the national economies that have shown the
        most rapid growth in the last several decades—for example,
        Japan, South Korea, China, and India—have done so by
        dramatically orienting their economies toward international
        trade. There is no modern example of a country that has shut
        itself off from world trade and yet prospered. To understand the
        benefits of trade, or why we trade in the first place, we need
        to understand the concepts of comparative and absolute
        advantage.

        <span id="bookmark1597">In 1817, David Ricardo, a businessman,
        economist, and member of the British Parliament, wrote a
        treatise called</span> *On the Principles of Political Economy
        and Taxation*. In this treatise, Ricardo argued that
        specialization and free trade benefit all trading partners, even
        those that may be relatively inefficient. To see what he meant,
        we must be able to distinguish between absolute and comparative
        advantage.

        <span id="bookmark1598">A country has an</span> **absolute
        advantage** over another country in producing a good if it uses
        fewer resources to produce that good. Absolute advantage can be
        the result of a country’s natural endowment. For example,
        extracting oil in

          

          

        Saudi Arabia is pretty much just a matter of “drilling a hole.”
        Producing oil in other countries can require considerable
        exploration and costly technologies for drilling and
        extraction—if they have any oil at all. The United States has
        some of the richest farmland in the world, making it easier to
        grow corn and wheat than in many other countries. Guatemala and
        Colombia have climates especially suited for growing coffee.
        Chile and Zambia have some of the world’s richest copper mines.
        As some have argued, “geography is destiny.” Chile will provide
        copper and Guatemala will produce coffee, and they will trade.
        When each country has a product others need and it can produce
        it with fewer resources in one country than in another, then it
        is easy to imagine all parties benefitting from trade. However,
        thinking about trade just in terms of geography and absolute
        advantage is incomplete. Trade really occurs because of
        comparative advantage.

        <a href="#bookmark96" id="bookmark1599" class="s34">Recall from the chapter</a>
        <a href="#bookmark96" class="a">Choice in a World of Scarcity</a>
        <a href="#bookmark96" class="s34">that a country has a comparative advantage when it can produce a good at a lower cost in terms of other goods. The question each country or company should be asking when it trades is this: “What do we give up to produce this good?” It should be no surprise that the concept of comparative advantage is based on this idea of opportunity cost from</a>
        <a href="#bookmark96" class="a">Choice in a World of</a>
        Scarcity<span class="p">. For example, if Zambia focuses its
        resources on producing copper, it cannot use its labor, land and
        financial resources to produce other goods such as corn. As a
        result, Zambia gives up the opportunity to produce corn. How do
        we quantify the cost in terms of other goods? Simplify the
        problem and assume that Zambia just needs labor to produce
        copper and corn. The companies that produce either copper or
        corn tell you that it takes two hours to mine a ton of copper
        and one hour to harvest a bushel of corn. This means the
        opportunity cost of producing a ton of copper is two bushels of
        corn. The next section develops absolute and comparative
        advantage in greater detail and relates them to
        trade.</span><span id="bookmark1600">‌</span>

          

          

        A Numerical Example of Absolute and Comparative Advantage

        <a href="#bookmark1601" class="s34">Consider a hypothetical world with two countries, Saudi Arabia and the United States, and two products, oil and corn. Further assume that consumers in both countries desire both these goods. These goods are homogeneous, meaning that consumers/producers cannot differentiate between corn or oil from either country. There is only one resource available in both countries, labor hours. Saudi Arabia can produce oil with fewer resources, while the United States can produce corn with fewer resources.</a>

Frontiers</span>
<a href="#bookmark1601" class="s84">(a) Saudi Arabia can produce 100 barrels of oil at maximum and zero corn (point A), or 25 bushels of corn and zero oil (point B). It can also produce other combinations of oil and corn if it wants to consume both goods, such as at point C. Here it chooses to produce/consume 60 barrels of oil, leaving 40 work hours that to allocate to produce 10 bushels of corn, using the data in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1601" class="s43">Table</a> 20.1<span class="s37">.
(b) If the United States produces only oil, it can produce, at maximum,
50 barrels and zero corn (point A'), or at the other extreme, it can
produce a maximum of 100 bushels of corn and no oil (point B'). Other
combinations of both oil and corn are possible, such as point C'. All
points above the frontiers are impossible to produce given the current
level of resources and technology.</span>

  

<a href="#bookmark1605" class="s34">Arguably Saudi and U.S. consumers desire both oil and corn to live. Let’s say that before trade occurs, both countries produce and consume at point C or C'. Thus, before trade, the Saudi Arabian economy will devote 60 worker hours to produce oil, as</a>

choice implies that it produces/ consumes 60 barrels of oil. With the
remaining 40 worker hours, since it needs four hours to produce a bushel
of corn, it can produce only 10 bushels. To be at point C', the U.S.
economy devotes 40 worker hours to produce 20 barrels of oil and it can
allocate the remaining worker hours to produce 60 bushels of
corn.</span>

Table 20.3 Production before Trade

  

The slope of the production possibility frontier illustrates the
opportunity cost of producing oil in terms of corn. Using all its
resources, the United States can produce 50 barrels of oil *or* 100
bushels of corn; therefore, the opportunity cost of one barrel of oil is
two bushels of corn—or the slope is 1/2. Thus, in the U.S. production
possibility frontier graph, every increase in oil production of one
barrel implies a decrease of two bushels of corn. Saudi Arabia can
produce 100 barrels of oil *or*
<a href="#bookmark1606" class="s34">25 bushels of corn. The opportunity cost of producing one barrel of oil is the loss of 1/4 of a bushel of corn that Saudi workers could otherwise have produced. In terms of corn, notice that Saudi Arabia gives up the least to produce a barrel of oil.</a>

Table 20.4 Opportunity Cost and Comparative Advantage

  

Again recall that we defined comparative advantage as the opportunity
cost of producing goods. Since Saudi Arabia

gives up the least to produce a barrel of oil, ( <span

production.

The United States gives up the least to produce a bushel of corn, so it
has a comparative advantage in corn production.

Can a production possibility frontier be straight?

<a href="#bookmark96" class="s84">When you first met the production possibility frontier (PPF) in the chapter on</a>
Choice in a World of Scarcity <span class="s37">we drew it with an
outward-bending shape. This shape illustrated that as we transferred
inputs from producing one good to another—like from education to health
services—there were increasing opportunity costs. In the examples in
this chapter, we draw the PPFs as straight lines, which means that
opportunity costs are constant. When we transfer a marginal unit of
labor away from growing corn and toward producing oil, the decline in
the quantity of corn and the increase in the quantity of oil is always
the same. In reality this is possible only if the contribution of
additional workers to output did not change as the scale of production
changed. The linear production possibilities frontier is a less
realistic model, but a straight line simplifies calculations. It also
illustrates economic themes like absolute and comparative advantage just
as clearly.</span>

<a href="#bookmark1601" class="s34">In this example, there is symmetry between absolute and comparative advantage. Saudi Arabia needs fewer worker hours to produce oil (absolute advantage, see</a>
<a href="#bookmark1601" class="a">Table</a>
20.1<a href="#bookmark1606" class="s34">), and also gives up the least in terms of other goods to produce oil (comparative advantage, see</a>
<a href="#bookmark1606" class="a">Table</a> 20.4<span class="p">). Such
symmetry is not always the case, as we will show after we have discussed
gains from trade fully, but first, read the following Clear It Up
feature to make sure you understand why the PPF line in the graphs is
straight.</span>

  

  

Gains from Trade

<span id="bookmark1607"><span class="p">Consider the trading positions
of the United States and Saudi Arabia after they have specialized and
traded. Before trade, Saudi Arabia produces/consumes 60 barrels of oil

the United States can trade an amount of corn fewer than 60 bushels and

<a href="#bookmark1608" class="s34">defined specialization as it applies to workers and firms. Economists also use specialization to describe the occurrence when a country shifts resources to focus on producing a good that offers comparative advantage.)

Table 20.5 The Range of Trades That Benefit Both the United States and
Saudi Arabia

  

<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_411.png" width="624" height="51" alt="image" />

What are the opportunity costs and gains from trade?

The range of trades that will benefit each country is based on the
country’s opportunity cost of producing each good. The United States can
produce 100 bushels of corn or 50 barrels of oil. For the United States,
the opportunity cost of producing one barrel of oil is two bushels of
corn. If we divide the numbers above by 50, we get the same ratio: one
barrel of oil is equivalent to two bushels of corn, or (100/50 = 2 and
50/50 = 1). In a trade with Saudi Arabia, if the United States is going
to give up 100 bushels of corn in exports, it must import at least 50
barrels of oil to be just as well off. Clearly, to gain from trade it
needs to be able to gain more than a half barrel of oil for its bushel
of corn—or why trade at all?

The underlying reason why trade benefits both sides is rooted in the
concept of opportunity cost, as the following Clear It Up feature
explains. If Saudi Arabia wishes to expand domestic production of corn
in a world without international trade, then based on its opportunity
costs it must give up four barrels of oil for every one additional
bushel of corn. If Saudi Arabia could find a way to give up less than
four barrels of oil for an additional bushel of corn (or equivalently,
to receive more than one bushel of corn for four barrels of oil), it
would be better off.

  

  

<a href="#bookmark1609" class="s34">Recall that David Ricardo argued that if each country specializes in its comparative advantage, it will benefit from trade, and total global output will increase. How can we show gains from trade as a result of comparative advantage and specialization?</a>
<a href="#bookmark1609" class="a">Table 20.6</a>

Notice that even without 100% specialization, if the “trading price,” in

    Happens When a Country Has an Absolute Advantage in All
    Goods</span><span id="bookmark1611">‌</span>

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Show the relationship between production costs and comparative
        advantage

    -   Identify situations of mutually beneficial trade

    -   Identify trade benefits by considering opportunity costs

          

        What happens to the possibilities for trade if one country has
        an absolute advantage in everything? This is typical for
        high-income countries that often have well-educated workers,
        technologically advanced equipment, and the most up-to-date
        production processes. These high-income countries can produce
        all products with fewer resources than a low-income country. If
        the high-income country is more productive across the board,
        will there still be gains from trade? Good students of Ricardo
        understand that trade is about mutually beneficial exchange.
        Even when one country has an absolute advantage in all products,
        trade can still benefit both sides. This is because gains from
        trade come from specializing in one’s comparative advantage.

        Production Possibilities and Comparative Advantage

        produce 1,000 pairs of shoes, but it takes five Mexican workers
        to do so. It takes one U.S. worker to produce 1,000
        refrigerators, but it takes four Mexican workers to do so. The
        United States has an absolute advantage in productivity with
        regard to both shoes and refrigerators; that is, it takes fewer
        workers in the United States than in Mexico to produce both a
        given number of shoes and a given number of

        this good in this country?” Another way of looking at this is
        that comparative advantage identifies the good for which the
        producer’s absolute advantage is relatively larger, or where the
        producer’s absolute productivity disadvantage is relatively
        smaller. The United States can produce 1,000 shoes with
        four-fifths as many workers as Mexico (four versus five), but it
        can produce 1,000 refrigerators with only one-quarter as many
        workers (one versus four). So, the comparative advantage of the
        United States, where its absolute productivity advantage is
        relatively</span>

          

          

        greatest, lies with refrigerators, and Mexico’s comparative
        advantage, where its absolute productivity disadvantage is
        least, is in the production of shoes.

        Mutually Beneficial Trade with Comparative Advantage

        When nations increase production in their area of comparative
        advantage and trade with each other, both countries can benefit.
        Again, the production possibility frontier is a useful tool to
        visualize this benefit.

        <a href="#bookmark1614" class="s34">Consider a situation where the United States and Mexico each have 40 workers. For example, as</a>
        <a href="#bookmark1614" class="a">Table 20.8</a> <span
        class="p">shows, if the United States divides its labor so that
        40 workers are making shoes, then, since it takes four workers
        in the United States to make 1,000 shoes, a total of 10,000
        shoes will be produced. (If four workers can make 1,000 shoes,
        then 40 workers will make 10,000 shoes). If the 40 workers in
        the United States are making refrigerators, and each worker can
        produce 1,000 refrigerators, then a total of 40,000
        refrigerators will be produced.</span>

        <a href="#bookmark1617" class="s34">Continuing with this scenario, suppose that each country transfers some amount of labor toward its area of comparative advantage. For example, the United States transfers six workers away from shoes and toward producing refrigerators. As a result, U.S. production of shoes decreases by 1,500 units (6/4 × 1,000), while its production of refrigerators increases by 6,000 (that is, 6/1 × 1,000). Mexico also moves production toward its area of comparative advantage, transferring 10 workers away from refrigerators and toward production of shoes. As a result, production of refrigerators in Mexico falls by 2,500 (10/4 × 1,000), but production of shoes increases by 2,000 pairs (10/5 × 1,000). Notice that when both countries shift production toward each of their comparative advantages (what they are relatively better at), their combined production of both goods rises, as shown in</a>

        Table 20.10 Shifting Production Toward Comparative Advantage
        Raises Total Output

          

        This numerical example illustrates the remarkable insight of
        comparative advantage: even when one country has an absolute
        advantage in all goods and another country has an absolute
        disadvantage in all goods, both countries can still benefit from
        trade. Even though the United States has an absolute advantage
        in producing both refrigerators and shoes, it makes economic
        sense for it to specialize in the good for which it has a
        comparative advantage. The United States will export
        refrigerators and in return import shoes.

        How Opportunity Cost Sets the Boundaries of Trade

        This example shows that both parties can benefit from
        specializing in their comparative advantages and trading. By
        using the opportunity costs in this example, it is possible to
        identify the range of possible trades that would benefit each
        country.

        <a href="#bookmark1615" id="bookmark1618" class="s34">Mexico started out, before specialization and trade, producing 4,000 pairs of shoes and 5,000 refrigerators (see</a>
        <a href="#bookmark1615" class="a">Figure</a> 20.4
        <a href="#bookmark1616" class="s34">and</a>
        <a href="#bookmark1616" class="a">Table</a> 20.9<span
        class="p">). Then, in the numerical example given, Mexico
        shifted production toward its comparative advantage and produced
        6,000 pairs of shoes but only 2,500 refrigerators. Thus, if
        Mexico can export no more than 2,000 pairs of shoes (giving up
        2,000 pairs of shoes) in exchange for imports of at least 2,500
        refrigerators (a gain of 2,500 refrigerators), it will be able
        to consume more of both goods than before trade. Mexico will be
        unambiguously better off. Conversely, the United States started
        off, before specialization and trade, producing 5,000 pairs of
        shoes and 20,000 refrigerators. In the example, it then shifted
        production toward its comparative advantage, producing only
        3,500 shoes but 26,000 refrigerators. If the United States can
        export no more than 6,000 refrigerators in exchange for imports
        of at least 1,500 pairs of shoes, it will be able to consume
        more of both goods and will be unambiguously better
        off.</span><span id="bookmark1619">‌</span>

        trades for refrigerators made in the United States, where the
        opportunity cost of producing refrigerators is lower, Mexico can
        in effect take advantage of the lower opportunity cost of
        refrigerators in the United States. Conversely, when the United
        States specializes in its comparative advantage of refrigerator
        production and trades for shoes produced in Mexico,
        international trade allows the United States to take advantage
        of the lower opportunity cost of shoe production in
        Mexico.</span>

        The theory of comparative advantage explains why countries
        trade: they have different comparative advantages. It shows that
        the gains from international trade result from pursuing
        comparative advantage and producing at a lower opportunity cost.
        The following Work It Out feature shows how to calculate
        absolute and comparative advantage and the way to apply them to
        a country’s production.

          

        Calculating Absolute and Comparative Advantage

        In Canada a worker can produce 20 barrels of oil or 40 tons of
        lumber. In Venezuela, a worker can produce 60 barrels of oil or
        30 tons of lumber.

        Table 20.12

          

        1.  Who has the absolute advantage in the production of oil or
            lumber? How can you tell?

        2.  Which country has a comparative advantage in the production
            of oil?

        3.  Which country has a comparative advantage in producing
            lumber?

        4.  In this example, is absolute advantage the same as
            comparative advantage, or not?

        5.  <a href="#bookmark1622" class="s84">In what product should Canada specialize? In what product should Venezuela specialize? Step 1. Make a table like</a>
            <a href="#bookmark1622" class="s43">Table</a> 20.12<span
            class="s37">.</span>

        Step 2. To calculate absolute advantage, look at the larger of
        the numbers for each product. One worker in Canada can produce
        more lumber (40 tons versus 30 tons), so Canada has the absolute
        advantage in lumber. One worker in Venezuela can produce 60
        barrels of oil compared to a worker in Canada who can produce
        only 20.

        Step 3. To calculate comparative advantage, find the opportunity
        cost of producing one barrel of oil in both countries. The
        country with the lowest opportunity cost has the comparative
        advantage. With the same labor

          

        time, Canada can produce either 20 barrels of oil or 40 tons of
        lumber. So in effect, 20 barrels of oil is equivalent to 40 tons
        of lumber: 20 oil = 40 lumber. Divide both sides of the equation
        by 20 to calculate the opportunity cost of one barrel of oil in
        Canada. 20/20 oil = 40/20 lumber. 1 oil = 2 lumber. To produce
        one additional barrel of oil in Canada has an opportunity cost
        of 2 lumber. Calculate the same way for Venezuela: 60 oil = 30
        lumber. Divide both sides of the equation by 60. One oil in
        Venezuela has an opportunity cost of 1/ 2 lumber. Because 1/2
        lumber &lt; 2 lumber, Venezuela has the comparative advantage in
        producing oil.

        Step 4. Calculate the opportunity cost of one lumber by
        reversing the numbers, with lumber on the left side of the
        equation. In Canada, 40 lumber is equivalent in labor time to 20
        barrels of oil: 40 lumber = 20 oil. Divide each side of the
        equation by 40. The opportunity cost of one lumber is 1/2 oil.
        In Venezuela, the equivalent labor time will produce 30 lumber
        or 60 oil: 30 lumber = 60 oil. Divide each side by 30. One
        lumber has an opportunity cost of two oil. Canada has the lower
        opportunity cost in producing lumber.

        Step 5. In this example, absolute advantage is the same as
        comparative advantage. Canada has the absolute and comparative
        advantage in lumber; Venezuela has the absolute and comparative
        advantage in oil.

        Step 6. Canada should specialize in the commodity for which it
        has a relative lower opportunity cost, which is lumber, and
        Venezuela should specialize in oil. Canada will be exporting
        lumber and importing oil, and Venezuela will be exporting oil
        and importing lumber.

          

        Comparative Advantage Goes Camping

        To build an intuitive understanding of how comparative advantage
        can benefit all parties, set aside examples that involve
        national economies for a moment and consider the situation of a
        group of friends who decide to go camping together. The six
        friends have a wide range of skills and experiences, but one
        person in particular, Jethro, has done lots of camping before
        and is also a great athlete. Jethro has an absolute advantage in
        all aspects of camping: he is faster at carrying a backpack,
        gathering firewood, paddling a canoe, setting up tents, making a
        meal, and washing up. So here is the question: Because Jethro
        has an absolute productivity advantage in everything, should he
        do all the work?

        Of course not! Even if Jethro is willing to work like a mule
        while everyone else sits around, he, like all mortals, only has
        24 hours in a day. If everyone sits around and waits for Jethro
        to do everything, not only will Jethro be an unhappy camper, but
        there will not be much output for his group of six friends to
        consume. The theory of comparative advantage suggests that
        everyone will benefit if they figure out their areas of
        comparative advantage—that is, the area of camping where their
        productivity disadvantage is least, compared to Jethro. For
        example, it may be that Jethro is 80% faster at building fires
        and cooking meals than anyone else, but only 20% faster at
        gathering firewood and 10% faster at setting up tents. In that
        case, Jethro should focus on building fires and making meals,
        and others should attend to the other tasks, each according to
        where their productivity disadvantage is smallest. If the
        campers coordinate their efforts according to comparative
        advantage, they can all gain.

          

2.  <span id="bookmark1589">|</span> <span
    style=" color: #3767B1;">Intra-industry Trade between Similar
    Economies</span><span id="bookmark1623">‌</span>

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Identify at least two advantages of intra-industry trading

    -   Explain the relationship between economies of scale and
        intra-industry trade

          

        Absolute and comparative advantages explain a great deal about
        global trading patterns. For example, they help to explain the
        patterns that we noted at the start of this chapter, like why
        you may be eating fresh fruit from Chile or Mexico, or why lower
        productivity regions like Africa and Latin America are able to
        sell a substantial proportion of their exports to higher
        productivity regions like the European Union and North America.
        Comparative advantage, however, at least at first glance, does
        not seem especially well-suited to explain other common patterns
        of international trade.

        The Prevalence of Intra-industry Trade between Similar Economies

        The theory of comparative advantage suggests that trade should
        happen between economies with large differences in opportunity
        costs of production. Roughly half of all world trade involves
        shipping goods between the fairly similar

        <span id="bookmark1627">Why do similar high-income economies
        engage in intra-industry trade? What can be the economic benefit
        of having workers of fairly similar skills making cars,
        computers, machinery and other products which are then shipped
        across the oceans to and from the United States, the European
        Union, and Japan? There are two reasons: (1) The division of
        labor leads to learning, innovation, and unique skills; and (2)
        economies of scale.</span>

        Gains from Specialization and Learning

        Consider the category of machinery, where the U.S. economy has
        considerable intra-industry trade. Machinery comes in many
        varieties, so the United States may be exporting machinery for
        manufacturing with wood, but importing machinery for
        photographic processing. The underlying reason why a country
        like the United States, Japan, or Germany produces one kind of
        machinery rather than another is usually not related to U.S.,
        German, or Japanese firms and workers having generally higher or
        lower skills. It is just that, in working on very specific and
        particular products, firms in certain countries develop unique
        and different skills.

          

          

        <span id="bookmark1628">Specialization in the world economy can
        be very finely split. In fact, recent years have seen a trend in
        international trade, which economists call</span> **splitting up
        the value chain**. The **value chain** describes how a good is
        produced in stages. As indicated in the beginning of the
        chapter, producing the iPhone involves designing and engineering
        the phone in the United States, supplying parts from Korea,
        assembling the parts in China, and advertising and marketing in
        the United States. Thanks in large part to improvements in
        communication technology, sharing information, and
        transportation, it has become easier to split up the value
        chain. Instead of production in a single large factory,
        different firms operating in various places and even different
        countries can divide the value chain. Because firms split up the
        value chain, international trade often does not involve nations
        trading whole finished products like automobiles or
        refrigerators. Instead, it involves shipping more specialized
        goods like, say, automobile dashboards or the shelving that fits
        inside refrigerators. Intra-industry trade between similar
        countries produces economic gains because it allows workers and
        firms to learn and innovate on particular products—and often to
        focus on very particular parts of the value chain.

        Economies of Scale, Competition, Variety

        <a href="http://cnx.org/content/m63680/latest/" id="bookmark1629" class="s34">A second broad reason that intra-industry trade between similar nations produces economic gains involves economies of scale. The concept of economies of scale, as we introduced in</a>
        <a href="http://cnx.org/content/m63680/latest/" class="a">Production, Costs and Industry Structure (http://cnx.org/content/m63680/latest/)</a>
        <a href="#bookmark1630" class="s34">, means that as the scale of output goes up, average costs of production decline—at least up to a point.</a>
        <a href="#bookmark1630" class="a">Figure 20.5</a> <span
        class="p">illustrates economies of scale for a plant producing
        toaster ovens. The horizontal axis of the figure shows the
        quantity of production by a certain firm or at a certain
        manufacturing plant. The vertical axis measures the average cost
        of production. Production plant S produces a small level of
        output at 30 units and has an average cost of production of $30
        per toaster oven. Plant M produces at a medium level of output
        at 50 units, and has an average cost of production of $20 per
        toaster oven. Plant L produces 150 units of output with an
        average cost of production of only $10 per toaster oven.
        Although plant V can produce 200 units of output, it still has
        the same unit cost as Plant L.</span>

        In this example, a small or medium plant, like S or M, will not
        be able to compete in the market with a large or a very large
        plant like L or V, because the firm that operates L or V will be
        able to produce and sell its output at a lower price. In this
        example, economies of scale operate up to point L, but beyond
        point L to V, the additional scale of production does not
        continue to reduce average costs of production.

          

        <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_418.jpg" width="301" height="205" alt="image" />

        <span id="bookmark1630">Figure 20.5 Economies of Scale</span>
        <span class="s37">Production Plant S, has an average cost of
        production of $30 per toaster oven. Production plant M has an
        average cost of production of $20 per toaster oven. Production
        plant L has an average cost of production of only $10 per
        toaster oven. Production plant V still has an average cost of
        production of $10 per toaster oven. Thus, production plant M can
        produce toaster ovens more cheaply than plant S because of
        economies of scale, and plants L or V can produce more cheaply
        than S or M because of economies of scale. However, the
        economies of scale end at an output level of 150. Plant V,
        despite being larger, cannot produce more cheaply on average
        than plant L.</span>

          

        <span id="bookmark1631">The concept of economies of scale
        becomes especially relevant to international trade when it
        enables one or two large producers to supply the entire country.
        For example, a single large automobile factory could probably
        supply all the cars consumers purchase in a smaller economy like
        the United Kingdom or Belgium in a given year. However, if a
        country has only one or two large factories producing cars, and
        no international trade, then consumers in that country would
        have relatively little choice between kinds of cars (other than
        the color of the paint and other nonessential options). Little
        or no competition will exist between different car
        manufacturers.</span>

        International trade provides a way to combine the lower average
        production costs that come from economies of scale and still
        have competition and variety for consumers. Large automobile
        factories in different countries can make and sell their
        products around the world. If General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler
        were the only players in the

        U.S. automobile market, the level of competition and consumer
        choice would be considerably lower than when U.S. carmakers must
        face competition from Toyota, Honda, Suzuki, Fiat, Mitsubishi,
        Nissan, Volkswagen, Kia, Hyundai, BMW, Subaru, and others.
        Greater competition brings with it innovation and responsiveness
        to what consumers want. America’s car producers make far better
        cars now than they did several decades ago, and much of the
        reason is competitive pressure, especially from East Asian and
        European carmakers.

        Dynamic Comparative Advantage

        The sources of gains from intra-industry trade between similar
        economies—namely, the learning that comes from a high degree of
        specialization and splitting up the value chain and from
        economies of scale—do not contradict the earlier theory of
        comparative advantage. Instead, they help to broaden the
        concept.

        In intra-industry trade, climate or geography do not determine
        the level of worker productivity. Even the general level of
        education or skill does not determine it. Instead, how firms
        engage in specific learning about specialized products,
        including taking advantage of economies of scale determine the
        level of worker productivity. In this vision, comparative
        advantage can be dynamic—that is, it can evolve and change over
        time as one develops new skills and as manufacturers split the
        value chain in new ways. This line of thinking also suggests
        that countries are not destined to have the same comparative
        advantage forever, but must instead be flexible in response to
        ongoing changes in comparative advantage.

          

3.  <span id="bookmark1590">|</span> <span style=" color: #3767B1;">The
    Benefits of Reducing Barriers to International Trade</span><span
    id="bookmark1632">‌</span>

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Explain tarrifs as barriers to trade

    -   Identify at least two benefits of reducing barriers to
        international trade

          

        <span id="bookmark1633">Tariffs</span> <span class="p">are taxes
        that governments place on imported goods for a variety of
        reasons. Some of these reasons include protecting sensitive
        industries, for humanitarian reasons, and protecting against
        dumping. Traditionally, tariffs were used simply as a political
        tool to protect certain vested economic, social, and cultural
        interests. The World Trade Organization (WTO) is committed to
        lowering barriers to trade. The world’s nations meet through the
        WTO to negotiate how they can reduce barriers to trade, such as
        tariffs. WTO negotiations happen in “rounds,” where all
        countries negotiate one agreement to encourage trade, take a
        year or two off, and then start negotiating a new agreement. The
        current round of negotiations is called the Doha Round because
        it was officially launched in Doha, the capital city of Qatar,
        in November 2001. In 2009, economists from the World Bank
        summarized recent research and found that the Doha round of
        negotiations would increase the size of the world economy by
        $160 billion to $385 billion per year, depending on the precise
        deal that ended up being negotiated.</span><span
        id="bookmark1634">‌</span><span id="bookmark1635">‌</span>

        In the context of a global economy that currently produces more
        than $30 trillion of goods and services each year, this amount
        is not huge: it is an increase of 1% or less. But before
        dismissing the gains from trade too quickly, it is worth
        remembering two points.

    -   First, a gain of a few hundred billion dollars is enough money
        to deserve attention! Moreover, remember that this increase is
        not a one-time event; it would persist each year into the
        future.

    -   Second, the estimate of gains may be on the low side because
        some of the gains from trade are not measured especially well in
        economic statistics. For example, it is difficult to measure the
        potential advantages to consumers of having a variety of
        products available and a greater degree of competition among
        producers. Perhaps the most important unmeasured factor is that
        trade between countries, especially when firms are splitting up
        the value chain of production, often involves a transfer of
        knowledge that can involve skills in production, technology,
        management, finance, and law.

Low-income countries benefit more from trade than high-income countries
do. In some ways, the giant U.S. economy has less need for international
trade, because it can already take advantage of internal trade within
its economy. However, many smaller national economies around the world,
in regions like Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia, have
much more limited possibilities for trade inside their countries or
their immediate regions. Without international trade, they may have
little ability to benefit from comparative advantage, slicing up the
value chain, or economies of scale. Moreover, smaller economies often
have fewer competitive firms making goods within their economy, and thus
firms have less pressure from other firms to provide the goods and
prices that consumers want.

The economic gains from expanding international trade are measured in
hundreds of billions of dollars, and the gains from international trade
as a whole probably reach well into the trillions of dollars. The
potential for gains from trade may be especially high among the smaller
and lower-income countries of the world.

From Interpersonal to International Trade

Most people find it easy to believe that they, personally, would not be
better off if they tried to grow and process all of their own food, to
make all of their own clothes, to build their own cars and houses from
scratch, and so on. Instead, we all benefit from living in economies
where people and firms can specialize and trade with each other.

The benefits of trade do not stop at national boundaries, either.
Earlier we explained that the division of labor could increase output
for three reasons: (1) workers with different characteristics can
specialize in the types of production where they have a comparative
advantage; (2) firms and workers who specialize in a certain product
become more productive with learning and practice; and (3) economies of
scale. These three reasons apply from the individual and community level
right up to the international level. If it makes sense to you that
interpersonal, intercommunity, and interstate trade offer economic
gains, it should make sense that international trade offers gains, too.

It’s Apple’s (Global) iPhone

Apple Corporation uses a global platform to produce the iPhone. Now that
you understand the concept of comparative advantage, you can see why the
engineering and design of the iPhone is done in the United States. The
United States has built up a comparative advantage over the years in
designing and marketing products, and sacrifices fewer resources to
design high-tech devices relative to other countries. China has a
comparative advantage in assembling the phone due to its large skilled
labor force. Korea has a comparative advantage in producing components.
Korea focuses its production by increasing its scale, learning better
ways to produce screens and computer chips, and uses innovation to lower
average costs of production. Apple, in turn, benefits because it can
purchase these quality products at lower prices. Put the global assembly
line together and you have the device with which we are all so familiar.

International trade currently involves about $20 trillion worth of goods
and services moving around the globe. Any economic force of that size,
even if it confers overall benefits, is certain to cause disruption and
controversy. This chapter has only made the case that trade brings
economic benefits. Other chapters discuss, in detail, the public policy
arguments over whether to restrict international trade.

KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY

  

1.  <a href="#bookmark1596" class="a">Absolute and Comparative</a>
    [Advantage](#bookmark1596)

    A country has an absolute advantage in those products in which it
    has a productivity edge over other countries; it takes fewer
    resources to produce a product. A country has a comparative
    advantage when it can produce a good at a lower cost in terms of
    other goods. Countries that specialize based on comparative
    advantage gain from trade.

      

2.  <a href="#bookmark1611" class="a">What Happens When a Country Has an Absolute Advantage in All</a>
    [Goods](#bookmark1611)

    Even when a country has high levels of productivity in all goods, it
    can still benefit from trade. Gains from trade come about as a
    result of comparative advantage. By specializing in a good that it
    gives up the least to produce, a country can produce more and offer
    that additional output for sale. If other countries specialize in
    the area of their comparative advantage as well and trade, the
    highly productive country is able to benefit from a lower
    opportunity cost of production in other countries.

      

3.  <a href="#bookmark1623" class="a">Intra-industry Trade between Similar</a>
    [Economies](#bookmark1623)

    A large share of global trade happens between high-income economies
    that are quite similar in having well-educated workers and advanced
    technology. These countries practice intra-industry trade, in which
    they import and export the same products at the same time, like
    cars, machinery, and computers. In the case of intra-industry trade
    between economies with similar income levels, the gains from trade
    come from specialized learning in very particular tasks and from
    economies of scale. Splitting up the value chain means that several
    stages of producing a good take place in different countries around
    the world.

      

4.  <a href="#bookmark1632" class="a">The Benefits of Reducing Barriers to International</a>
    [Trade](#bookmark1632)

Tariffs are placed on imported goods as a way of protecting sensitive
industries, for humanitarian reasons, and for protection against
dumping. Traditionally, tariffs were used as a political tool to protect
certain vested economic, social, and cultural interests. The WTO has
been, and continues to be, a way for nations to meet and negotiate in
order to reduce barriers to trade. The gains of international trade are
very large, especially for smaller countries, but are beneficial to all.

        90,000, can this economy take full advantage of economies of
        scale? What about if quantity demanded is 70,000 semiconductors?
        50,000 semiconductors? 30,000 semiconductors?

    3.  Explain how international trade could make it possible for even
        a small economy to take full advantage of economies of scale,
        while also benefiting from competition and the variety offered
        by several producers.

    4.  You just overheard your friend say the following: “Poor
        countries like Malawi have no absolute advantages. They have
        poor soil, low investments in formal education and hence
        low-skill workers, no capital, and no natural resources to speak
        of. Because they have no advantage, they cannot benefit from
        trade.” How would you respond?

1.  You just got a job in Washington, D.C. You move into an apartment
    with some acquaintances. All your roommates, however, are slackers
    and do not clean up after themselves. You, on the other hand, can
    clean faster than each of them. You determine that you are 70%
    faster at dishes and 10% faster with vacuuming. All of these tasks
    have to be done daily. Which jobs should you assign to your
    roommates to get the most free time overall? Assume you have the
    same number of hours to devote to cleaning. Now, since you are
    faster, you seem to get done quicker than your roommate. What sorts
    of problems may this create? Can you imagine a trade- related
    analogy to this problem?

2.  Does intra-industry trade contradict the theory of comparative

    PROBLEMS

8.  <span id="bookmark1650">France and Tunisia both have Mediterranean
    climates that are excellent for producing/harvesting green beans and
    tomatoes. In France it takes two hours for each worker to harvest
    green beans and two hours to harvest a tomato. Tunisian workers need
    only one hour to harvest the tomatoes but four hours to harvest
    green beans. Assume there are only two workers, one in each country,
    and each works 40 hours a week.</span>

    1.  Draw a production possibilities frontier for each country.
        *Hint*: Remember the production possibility frontier is the
        maximum that all workers can produce at a unit of time which, in
        this problem, is a week.

    2.  Identify which country has the absolute advantage in green beans
        and which country has the absolute advantage in tomatoes.

    3.  Identify which country has the comparative advantage.

    4.  How much would France have to give up in terms of tomatoes to
        gain from trade? How much would it have to give up in terms of
        green beans?

9.  In Japan, one worker can make 5 tons of rubber or 80 radios. In
    Malaysia, one worker can make 10 tons of rubber or 40 radios.

    1.  Who has the absolute advantage in the production of rubber or
        radios? How can you tell?

    2.  Calculate the opportunity cost of producing 80 additional radios

    1.  Draw a production possibilities frontier for each country.
        Assume there are 100 workers in each country. Canadians and
        Venezuelans desire both oil and lumber. Canadians want at least
        2,000 tons of lumber. Mark a point on their production
        possibilities where they can get at least 3,000 tons.

    2.  Assume that the Canadians specialize completely because they
        figured out they have a comparative advantage in lumber. They
        are willing to give up 1,000 tons of lumber. How much oil should
        they ask for in return for this lumber to be as well off as they
        were with no trade? How much should they ask for if they want to
        gain from trading with Venezuela? *Note*: We can think of this
        “ask” as the relative price or trade price of lumber.

    3.  Is the Canadian “ask” you identified in (b) also beneficial for
        Venezuelans? Use the production possibilities frontier graph for
        Venezuela to show that Venezuelans can gain from trade.

12. From earlier chapters you will recall that technological change
    shifts the average cost curves. Draw a graph showing how
    technological change could influence intra-industry trade.

13. Consider two countries: South Korea and Taiwan. Taiwan can produce

    South Korea can produce 50 million mobile phones at $5 per phone.
    Assume these phones are the same type and quality and there is only
    one price. What is the minimum price at which both countries will
    engage in trade?

      

14. If trade increases world GDP by 1% per year, what is the global
    impact of this increase over 10 years? How does this increase
    compare to the annual GDP of a country like Sri Lanka? Discuss.
    *Hint*: To answer this question, here are steps you may want to
    consider. Go to the World Development Indicators (online) published
    by the World Bank. Find the current level of World GDP in constant
    international dollars. Also, find the GDP of Sri Lanka in constant
    international dollars. Once you have these two numbers, compute the
    amount the additional increase in global incomes due to trade and
    compare that number to Sri Lanka’s GDP.

What’s the Downside of Protection?

Governments are motivated to limit and alter market outcomes for
political or social ends. While governments can limit the rise in prices
of some products, they cannot control how much people want to buy or how
much firms are willing to sell. The laws of demand and supply still
hold. Trade policy is an example where regulations can redirect economic
forces, but it cannot stop them from manifesting themselves elsewhere.

Flat-panel displays, the displays for laptop computers, tablets, and
flat screen televisions, are an example of such an enduring principle.
In the early 1990s, the vast majority of flat-panel displays used in
U.S.- manufactured laptops were imported, primarily from Japan. The
small but politically powerful U.S. flat-panel- display industry filed a
dumping complaint with the Commerce Department. They argued that
Japanese firms were selling displays at “less than fair value,” which
made it difficult for U.S. firms to compete. This argument for trade
protection is referred to as anti-dumping. Other arguments for
protection in this complaint included national security. After a
preliminary determination by the Commerce Department that the Japanese
firms were dumping, the U.S. International Trade Commission imposed a
63% dumping margin (or tax) on the import of flat-panel displays. Was
this a successful exercise of U.S. trade policy? See what you think
after reading the chapter.

#### Introduction to Globalism and Protectionism

In this chapter, you will learn about:

-   Protectionism: An Indirect Subsidy from Consumers to Producers

-   International Trade and Its Effects on Jobs, Wages, and Working
    Conditions

-   Arguments in Support of Restricting Imports

-   How Trade Policy Is Enacted: Globally, Regionally, and Nationally

-   The Tradeoffs of Trade Policy

  

The world has become more connected on multiple levels, especially
economically. In 1970, imports and exports made up 11% of U.S. GDP,
while now they make up 32%. However, the United States, due to its size,
is less internationally connected than most countries. For example,
according to the World Bank, 97% of Botswana’s economic activity is
connected to trade. This chapter explores trade policy—the laws and
strategies a country uses to regulate international trade. This topic is
not without controversy.

As the world has become more globally connected, firms and workers in
high-income countries like the United States, Japan, or the nations of
the European Union, perceive a competitive threat from firms in
medium-income countries like Mexico, China, or South Africa, that have
lower costs of living and therefore pay lower wages. Firms and workers
in low-income countries fear that they will suffer if they must compete
against more productive workers and advanced technology in high-income
countries.

On a different tack, some environmentalists worry that multinational
firms may evade environmental protection laws by moving their production
to countries with loose or nonexistent pollution standards, trading a
clean environment for jobs. Some politicians worry that their country
may become overly dependent on key imported products, like oil, which in
a time of war could threaten national security. All of these fears
influence governments to reach the same basic policy conclusion: to
protect national interests, whether businesses, jobs, or security,
imports of foreign products should be restricted. This chapter analyzes
such arguments. First, however, it is essential to learn a few key
concepts and understand how the demand and supply model applies to
international trade.

    style=" color: #3767B1;">Protectionism: An Indirect Subsidy from
    Consumers to Producers</span><span id="bookmark1660">‌</span>

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Explain protectionism and its three main forms

    -   Analyze protectionism through concepts of demand and supply,
        noting its effects on equilibrium

    -   Calculate the effects of trade barriers

          

        <span id="bookmark1661">When a government legislates policies to
        reduce or block international trade it is engaging in</span>
        **protectionism**. Protectionist policies often seek to shield
        domestic producers and domestic workers from foreign
        competition. Protectionism takes three main forms: tariffs,
        import quotas, and nontariff barriers.

        <a href="#bookmark1593" id="bookmark1662" class="s34">Recall from</a>
        <a href="#bookmark1593" class="a">International Trade</a> <span
        class="p">that tariffs are taxes that governments impose on
        imported goods and services. This makes imports more expensive
        for consumers, discouraging imports. For example, in recent
        years large, flat- screen televisions imported to the U.S. from
        China have faced a 5% tariff rate.</span>

        <span id="bookmark1663">Another way to control trade is
        through</span> **import quotas**, which are numerical
        limitations on the quantity of products that a country can
        import. For instance, during the early 1980s, the Reagan
        Administration imposed a quota on the import of Japanese
        automobiles. In the 1970s, many developed countries, including
        the United States, found themselves with declining textile
        industries. Textile production does not require highly skilled
        workers, so producers were able to set up lower-cost factories
        in developing countries. In order to “manage” this loss of jobs
        and income, the developed countries established an international
        Multifiber Agreement that essentially divided the market for
        textile exports between importers and the remaining domestic
        producers. The agreement, which ran from 1974 to 2004,

          

          

        specified the exact quota of textile imports that each developed
        country would accept from each low-income country. A similar
        story exists for sugar imports into the United States, which are
        still governed by quotas.

        <span id="bookmark1664">Nontariff barriers</span> <span
        class="p">are all the other ways that a nation can draw up
        rules, regulations, inspections, and paperwork to make it more
        costly or difficult to import products. A rule requiring certain
        safety standards can limit imports just as effectively as high
        tariffs or low import quotas, for instance. There are also
        nontariff barriers in the form of “rules-of- origin”
        regulations; these rules describe the “Made in Country X” label
        as the one in which the last substantial change in the product
        took place. A manufacturer wishing to evade import restrictions
        may try to change the production process so that the last big
        change in the product happens in his or her own country. For
        example, certain textiles are made in the United States, shipped
        to other countries, combined with textiles made in those other
        countries to make apparel—and then re-exported back to the
        United States for a final assembly, to escape paying tariffs or
        to obtain a “Made in the USA” label.</span>

        Despite import quotas, tariffs, and nontariff barriers, the
        share of apparel sold in the United States that is imported rose
        from about half in 1999 to about three-quarters today. The U.S.
        Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), estimated the number of U.S.
        jobs in textiles and apparel fell from 666,360 in 2007 to
        385,240 in 2012, a 42% decline. Even more U.S. textile industry
        jobs would have been lost without tariffs. However, domestic
        jobs that are saved by import quotas come at a cost. Because
        textile and apparel protectionism adds to the costs of imports,
        consumers end up paying billions of dollars more for clothing
        each year.

        When the United States eliminates trade barriers in one area,
        consumers spend the money they save on that product elsewhere in
        the economy. Thus, while eliminating trade barriers in one
        sector of the economy will likely result in some job loss in
        that sector, consumers will spend the resulting savings in other
        sectors of the economy and hence increase the number of jobs in
        those other sectors. Of course, workers in some of the poorest
        countries of the world who would otherwise have jobs producing
        textiles, would gain considerably if the United States reduced
        its barriers to trade in textiles. That said, there are good
        reasons to be wary about reducing barriers to trade. The 2012
        and 2013 Bangladeshi fires in textile factories, which resulted
        in a horrific loss of life, present complications that our
        simplified analysis in the chapter will not capture.

        <span id="bookmark1665">Realizing the compromises between
        nations that come about due to trade policy, many countries came
        together in 1947 to form the General Agreement on Tariffs and
        Trade (GATT). (We’ll cover the GATT in more detail later in the
        chapter.) This agreement has since been superseded by the</span>
        **World Trade Organization (WTO)**, whose membership includes
        about 150 nations and most of the world's economies. It is the
        primary international mechanism through which nations negotiate
        their trade rules—including rules about tariffs, quotas, and
        nontariff barriers. The next section examines the results of
        such protectionism and develops a simple model to show the
        impact of trade policy.

        Demand and Supply Analysis of Protectionism

        To the non-economist, restricting imports may appear to be
        nothing more than taking sales from foreign producers and giving
        them to domestic producers. Other factors are at work, however,
        because firms do not operate in a vacuum. Instead, firms sell
        their products either to consumers or to other firms (if they
        are business suppliers), who are also affected by the trade
        barriers. A demand and supply analysis of protectionism shows
        that it is not just a matter of domestic gains and foreign
        losses, but a policy that imposes substantial domestic costs as
        well.

        <a href="#bookmark1668" id="bookmark1666" class="s34">Consider two countries, Brazil and the United States, who produce sugar. Each country has a domestic supply and demand for sugar, as</a>
        <a href="#bookmark1668" class="a">Table 21.1</a>
        <a href="#bookmark1667" class="s34">details and</a>
        <a href="#bookmark1667" class="a">Figure 21.2</a> <span
        class="p">illustrates. In Brazil, without trade, the equilibrium
        price of sugar is 12 cents per pound and the equilibrium output
        is 30 tons. When there is no trade in the United States, the
        equilibrium price of sugar is 24 cents per pound and the
        equilibrium quantity is 80 tons. We label these equilibrium
        points as point E in each part of the figure.</span>

        <span id="bookmark1667">Figure 21.2 The Sugar Trade between
        Brazil and the United States</span> <span class="s37">Before
        trade, the equilibrium price of sugar in Brazil is 12 cents a
        pound and it is 24 cents per pound in the United States. When
        trade is allowed, businesses will buy cheap sugar in Brazil and
        sell it in the United States. This will result in higher prices
        in Brazil and lower prices in the United States. Ignoring
        transaction costs, prices should converge to 16 cents per pound,
        with Brazil exporting 15 tons of sugar and the United States
        importing 15 tons of sugar. If trade is only partly open between
        the countries, it will lead to an outcome between the free-trade
        and no-trade possibilities.</span>

        Table 21.1 The Sugar Trade between Brazil and the United States

          

        If international trade between Brazil and the United States now
        becomes possible, profit-seeking firms will spot an opportunity:
        buy sugar cheaply in Brazil, and sell it at a higher price in
        the United States. As sugar is shipped from Brazil to the United
        States, the quantity of sugar produced in Brazil will be greater
        than Brazilian consumption (with the extra production exported),
        and the amount produced in the United States will be less than
        the amount of U.S. consumption (with the extra consumption
        imported). Exports to the United States will reduce the sugar
        supply in

          

          

        <a href="#bookmark1667" class="s34">Brazil, raising its price. Imports into the United States will increase the sugar supply, lowering its price. When the sugar price is the same in both countries, there is no incentive to trade further. As</a>
        <a href="#bookmark1667" class="a">Figure 21.2</a> <span
        class="p">shows, the equilibrium with trade occurs at a price of
        16 cents per pound. At that price, the sugar farmers of Brazil
        supply a quantity of 40 tons, while the consumers of Brazil buy
        only 25 tons.</span>

        <a href="#bookmark1670" id="bookmark1669" class="s34">The extra 15 tons of sugar production, shown by the horizontal gap between the demand curve and the supply curve in Brazil, is exported to the United States. In the United States, at a price of 16 cents, the farmers produce a quantity of 72 tons and consumers demand a quantity of 87 tons. The excess demand of 15 tons by American consumers, shown by the horizontal gap between demand and domestic supply at the price of 16 cents, is supplied by imported sugar. Free trade typically results in income distribution effects, but the key is to recognize the overall gains from trade, as</a>

        <a href="#bookmark159" class="s34">shows. Building on the concepts that we outlined in</a>

        Brazil are worse off (compare their no-trade consumer surplus
        with the free-trade consumer surplus) and U.S. producers of
        sugar are worse off. There are gains from trade—an increase in
        social surplus in each country. That is, both the United States
        and Brazil are better off than they would be without trade. The
        following Clear It Up feature explains how trade policy can

        Why are there low-income countries?

        <span id="bookmark1671">Why are the poor countries of the world
        poor? There are a number of reasons, but one of them will
        surprise you: the trade policies of the high-income countries.
        Following is a stark review of social priorities which the
        international aid organization, Oxfam International has widely
        publicized.</span>

        <span id="bookmark1672">High-income countries of the
        world—primarily the United States, Canada, countries of the
        European Union, and Japan—subsidize their domestic farmers
        collectively by about $360 billion per year. By contrast, the
        total amount of foreign aid from these same high-income
        countries to the poor countries of the world is about $70
        billion per year, or less than 20% of the farm subsidies. Why
        does this matter?</span>

        <span id="bookmark1673">It matters because the support of
        farmers in high-income countries is devastating to the
        livelihoods of farmers in low-income countries. Even when their
        climate and land are well-suited to products like cotton, rice,
        sugar, or milk, farmers in low-income countries find it
        difficult to compete. Farm subsidies in the high- income
        countries cause farmers in those countries to increase the
        amount they produce. This increase in supply drives down world
        prices of farm products below the costs of production. As
        Michael Gerson of the</span> *Washington Post* describes it:
        “\[T\]he effects in the cotton-growing regions of West Africa
        are dramatic . . . keep\[ing\] millions of Africans on the edge
        of malnutrition. In some of the poorest countries on Earth,
        cotton farmers are some of the poorest people, earning about a
        dollar a day Who benefits from the current<span
        id="bookmark1674">‌</span>

        system of subsidies? About 20,000 American cotton producers,
        with an average annual income of more than

        $125,000.”

        As if subsidies were not enough, often, the high-income
        countries block agricultural exports from low-income countries.
        In some cases, the situation gets even worse when the
        governments of high-income countries, having bought and paid for
        an excess supply of farm products, give away those products in
        poor countries and drive local farmers out of business
        altogether.

        For example, shipments of excess milk from the European Union to
        Jamaica have caused great hardship for Jamaican dairy farmers.
        Shipments of excess rice from the United States to Haiti drove
        thousands of low-income rice farmers in Haiti out of business.
        The opportunity costs of protectionism are not paid just by
        domestic consumers, but also by foreign producers—and for many
        agricultural products, those foreign producers are the world’s
        poor.

          

        <span id="bookmark1675">Now, let’s look at what happens with
        protectionism. U.S. sugar farmers are likely to argue that, if
        only they could be protected from sugar imported from Brazil,
        the United States would have higher domestic sugar production,
        more jobs in the sugar industry, and American sugar farmers
        would receive a higher price. If the United States government
        sets a high-enough tariff on imported sugar, or sets an import
        quota at zero, the result will be that the quantity of sugar
        traded between countries could be reduced to zero, and the
        prices in each country will return to the levels before trade
        was allowed.</span>

        Blocking only some trade is also possible. Suppose that the
        United States passed a sugar import quota of seven tons. The
        United States will import no more than seven tons of sugar,
        which means that Brazil can export no more than seven tons of
        sugar to the United States. As a result, the price of sugar in
        the United States will be 20 cents, which is

          

          

        the price where the quantity demanded is seven tons greater than
        the domestic quantity supplied. Conversely, if Brazil can export
        only seven tons of sugar, then the price of sugar in Brazil will
        be 14 cents per pound, which is the price where the domestic
        quantity supplied in Brazil is seven tons greater than domestic
        demand.

        <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_429.png" width="624" height="777" alt="image" />

        In general, when a country sets a low or medium tariff or import
        quota, the equilibrium price and quantity will be somewhere
        between those that prevail with no trade and those with
        completely free trade. The following Work It Out explores the
        impact of these trade barriers.

          

        Effects of Trade Barriers

        <a href="#bookmark226" id="bookmark1676" class="s84">Let’s look carefully at the effects of tariffs or quotas. If the U.S. government imposes a tariff or quota sufficient to eliminate trade with Brazil, two things occur: U.S. consumers pay a higher price and therefore buy a smaller quantity of sugar. U.S. producers obtain a higher price and they sell a larger quantity of sugar. We can measure the effects of a tariff on producers and consumers in the United States using two concepts that we developed in</a>
        <a href="#bookmark226" class="s43">Demand, Supply, and</a>
        Efficiency<span class="s37">: consumer surplus and producer

        equilibrium is at point A. When there is no trade, the
        equilibrium is at point E.</span>

          

        <a href="#bookmark1678" class="s84">Step 1. Look at</a>
        <a href="#bookmark1678" class="s43">Figure</a> 21.4<span
        class="s37">, which shows a hypothetical version of the demand
        and supply of sugar in the United States.</span>

        Step 2. Note that when there is free trade the sugar market is
        in equilibrium at point A where Domestic Quantity Demanded (Qd)
        = Quantity Supplied (Domestic Qs + Imports from Brazil) at a
        price of P<span class="s63">Trade</span>.

        Step 3. Note, also, that imports are equal to the distance
        between points C and A.

        Step 4. Recall that consumer surplus is the value that consumers
        get beyond what they paid for when they buy a product.
        Graphically, it is the area under a demand curve but above the
        price. In this case, the consumer surplus in the United States
        is the area of the triangle formed by the points P<span
        class="s63">Trade</span>, A, and B.

        Step 5. Recall, also, that producer surplus is another name for
        profit—it is the income producers get above the cost of
        production, which is shown by the supply curve here. In this
        case, the producer surplus with trade is the area of the
        triangle formed by the points P<span class="s63">trade</span>,
        C, and D.

        Step 6. Suppose that the barriers to trade are imposed, imports
        are excluded, and the price rises to P<span
        class="s63">NoTrade</span>. Look what happens to producer
        surplus and consumer surplus. At the higher price, the domestic
        quantity supplied increases from Qs to Q at point E. Because
        producers are selling more quantity at a higher price, the
        producer surplus increases to the area of the triangle P<span
        class="s63">NoTrade</span>, E, and D.

        Step 7. Compare the areas of the two triangles and you will see
        the increase in the producer surplus.

        Step 8. Examine the consumer surplus. Consumers are now paying a
        higher price to get a lower quantity (Q

          

        instead of Qd). Their consumer surplus shrinks to the area of
        the triangle P<span class="s63">NoTrade</span>, E, and B.

        Step 9. Determine the net effect. The producer surplus increases
        by the area P<span class="s63">trade</span>, C, E, P<span
        class="s63">NoTrade</span>. The loss of consumer surplus,
        however, is larger. It is the area P<span
        class="s63">trade</span>, A, E, P<span
        class="s63">NoTrade</span>. In other words, consumers lose more
        than producers gain as a result of the trade barriers and the
        United States has a lower social surplus.

          

        Who Benefits and Who Pays?

        <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_430.png" width="624" height="51" alt="image" />

        Using the demand and supply model, consider the impact of
        protectionism on producers and consumers in each of the two
        countries. For protected producers like U.S. sugar farmers,
        restricting imports is clearly positive. Without a need to face
        imported products, these producers are able to sell more, at a
        higher price. For consumers in the country with the protected
        good, in this case U.S. sugar consumers, restricting imports is
        clearly negative. They end up buying a lower quantity of the
        good and paying a higher price for what they do buy, compared to
        the equilibrium price and quantity with trade. The following
        Clear It Up feature considers why a country might outsource jobs
        even for a domestic product.

          

        Why are Life Savers, an American product, not made in America?

        In 1912, Clarence Crane invented Life Savers, the hard candy
        with the hole in the middle, in Cleveland, Ohio. Starting in the
        late 1960s and for 35 years afterward, a plant in Holland,
        Michigan produced 46 billion Life Savers a year, in 200 million
        rolls. However, in 2002, the Kraft Company announced that it
        would close the Michigan plant and move Life Saver production
        across the border to Montreal, Canada.

        One reason is that Canadian workers are paid slightly less,
        especially in healthcare and insurance costs that are not linked
        to employment there. Another main reason is that the United
        States government keeps the sugar price high for the benefit of
        sugar farmers, with a combination of a government price floor
        program and strict quotas on imported sugar. According to the
        Coalition for Sugar Reform, from 2009 to 2012, the price of
        refined sugar in the United States ranged from 64% to 92% higher
        than the world price. Life Saver production uses over 100 tons
        of sugar each day, because the candies are 95% sugar.

        A number of other candy companies have also reduced U.S.
        production and expanded foreign production. From 1997 to 2011,
        sugar-using industries eliminated some 127,000 jobs, or more
        than seven times the total employment in sugar production. While
        the candy industry is especially affected by the cost of sugar,
        the costs are spread more broadly. U.S. consumers pay roughly $1
        billion per year in higher food prices because of elevated sugar
        costs. Meanwhile, sugar producers in low-income countries are
        driven out of business. Because of the sugar subsidies to
        domestic producers and the quotas on imports, they cannot sell
        their output profitably, or at all, in the United States market.

          

        The fact that protectionism pushes up prices for consumers in
        the country enacting such protectionism is not always
        acknowledged openly, but it is not disputed. After all, if
        protectionism did not benefit domestic producers, there would
        not be much point in enacting such policies in the first place.
        Protectionism is simply a method of requiring consumers to
        subsidize producers. The subsidy is indirect, since consumers
        pay for it through higher prices, rather than a direct
        government subsidy paid with money collected from taxpayers.
        However, protectionism works like a subsidy, nonetheless. The
        American satirist Ambrose Bierce defined “tariff” this way in
        his 1911 book, *The Devil’s Dictionary*: “Tariff, n. A scale of
        taxes on imports, designed to protect the domestic producer
        against the greed of his consumer.”

        The effect of protectionism on producers and consumers in the
        foreign country is complex. When a government uses an import
        quota to impose partial protectionism, Brazilian sugar producers
        receive a lower price for the sugar they sell in Brazil—but a
        higher price for the sugar they are allowed to export to the
        United States. Notice that some of the burden of protectionism,
        paid by domestic consumers, ends up in the hands of foreign
        producers in this case. Brazilian sugar consumers seem to
        benefit from U.S. protectionism, because it reduces the price of
        sugar that they pay (compared to the free-trade situation). On
        the other hand, at least some of these Brazilian sugar consumers
        also work

          

          

        as sugar farmers, so protectionism reduces their incomes and
        jobs. Moreover, if trade between the countries vanishes,
        Brazilian consumers would miss out on better prices for imported
        goods—which do not appear in our single-market example of sugar
        protectionism.

        <a href="#bookmark1593" class="s34">The effects of protectionism on foreign countries notwithstanding, protectionism requires domestic consumers of a product (consumers may include either households or other firms) to pay higher prices to benefit domestic producers of that product. In addition, when a country enacts protectionism, it loses the economic gains it would have been able to achieve through a combination of comparative advantage, specialized learning, and economies of scale, concepts that we discuss in</a>

    style=" color: #3767B1;">International Trade and Its Effects on
    Jobs, Wages, and Working Conditions</span><span
    id="bookmark1679">‌</span>

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Discuss how international trade influences the job market

    -   Analyze the opportunity cost of protectionism

    -   Explain how international trade impacts wages, labor standards,
        and working conditions

          

        In theory at least, imports might injure workers in several
        different ways: fewer jobs, lower wages, or poor working
        conditions. Let’s consider these in turn.

        Fewer Jobs?

        <span id="bookmark1680">In the early 1990s, the United States
        was negotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)
        with Mexico, an agreement that reduced tariffs, import quotas,
        and nontariff barriers to trade between the United States,
        Mexico, and Canada. H. Ross Perot, a 1992 candidate for U.S.
        president, claimed, in prominent campaign arguments, that if the
        United States expanded trade with Mexico, there would be a
        “giant sucking sound” as U.S. employers relocated to Mexico to
        take advantage of lower wages. After all, average wages in
        Mexico were, at that time, about one-eighth of those in the
        United States. NAFTA passed Congress, President Bill Clinton
        signed it into law, and it took effect in 1995. For the next six
        years, the United States economy had some of the most rapid job
        growth and low unemployment in its history. Those who feared
        that open trade with Mexico would lead to a dramatic decrease in
        jobs were proven wrong.</span>

        This result was no surprise to economists. After all, the trend
        toward globalization has been going on for decades, not just
        since NAFTA. If trade did reduce the number of available jobs,
        then the United States should have been seeing a steady loss of
        jobs for decades. While the United States economy does
        experience rises and falls in unemployment rates—according to
        the Bureau of Labor Statistics, from spring 2007 to late 2009,
        the unemployment rate rose from 4.4% to 10%. It has since fallen
        back to under 5% as of the end of 2016—the number of jobs is not
        falling over extended periods of time. The number of U.S. jobs
        rose from 71 million in 1970 to 145 million in 2014.

        <span id="bookmark1681">Protectionism certainly saves jobs in
        the specific industry being protected but, for two reasons, it
        costs jobs in other unprotected industries. First, if consumers
        are paying higher prices to the protected industry, they
        inevitably have less money to spend on goods from other
        industries, and so jobs are lost in those other industries.
        Second, if a firm sells the protected product to other firms, so
        that other firms must now pay a higher price for a key input,
        then those firms will lose sales to foreign producers who do not
        need to pay the higher price. Lost sales translate into lost
        jobs. The hidden opportunity cost of using protectionism to save
        jobs in one industry is jobs sacrificed in other industries.
        This is why the United States International Trade Commission, in
        its study of barriers to trade, predicts that reducing trade
        barriers would not lead to an overall loss of jobs.
        Protectionism reshuffles jobs from industries without import
        protections to industries that are protected from imports, but
        it does not create more jobs.</span><span
        id="bookmark1682">‌</span>

        <a href="#bookmark1683" class="s34">Moreover, the costs of saving jobs through protectionism can be very high. A number of different studies have attempted to estimate the cost to consumers in higher prices per job saved through protectionism.</a>
        <a href="#bookmark1683" class="a">Table 21.2</a> <span
        class="p">shows a sample of results, compiled by economists at
        the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. Saving a job through
        protectionism typically costs much more than the actual worker’s
        salary. For example, a study published in 2002 compiled evidence
        that using protectionism to save an average job in the textile
        and apparel industry would cost $199,000 per job saved. In other
        words, those workers could have been paid $100,000 per year to
        be unemployed and the cost would only be half of what it is to
        keep them working in the textile and apparel industry. This
        result is not unique to textiles and</span>

          

          

        apparel.

        Table 21.2 Cost to U.S. Consumers of Saving a Job through
        Protectionism <span class="s47">(Source: Federal Reserve Bank of
        Dallas)</span>

          

        <a href="#bookmark297" class="s34">Why does it cost so much to save jobs through protectionism? The basic reason is that not all of the extra money that consumers pay because of tariffs or quotas goes to save jobs. For example, if the government imposes tariffs on steel imports so that steel buyers pay a higher price, U.S. steel companies earn greater profits, buy more equipment, pay bigger bonuses to managers, give pay raises to existing employees—and also avoid firing some additional workers. Only part of the higher price of protected steel goes toward saving jobs. Also, when an industry is protected, the economy as a whole loses the benefits of playing to its comparative advantage—in other words, producing what it is best at. Therefore, part of the higher price that consumers pay for protected goods is lost economic efficiency, which we can measure as another deadweight loss, like what we discussed in</a>
        <a href="#bookmark297" class="a">Labor and Financial</a>
        Markets<span class="p">.</span>

        There’s a bumper sticker that speaks to the threat some U.S.
        workers feel from imported products: “Buy American—Save U.S.
        Jobs.” If an economist were driving the car, the sticker might
        declare: “Block Imports—Save Jobs for Some Americans, Lose Jobs
        for Other Americans, and Also Pay High Prices.”

        Trade and Wages

        Even if trade does not reduce the number of jobs, it could
        affect wages. Here, it is important to separate issues about the
        average level of wages from issues about whether the wages of
        certain workers may be helped or hurt by trade.

        Because trade raises the amount that an economy can produce by
        letting firms and workers play to their comparative advantage,
        trade will also cause the average level of wages in an economy
        to rise. Workers who can produce more will be more desirable to
        employers, which will shift the demand for their labor out to
        the right, and increase wages in the labor market. By contrast,
        barriers to trade will reduce the average level of wages in an
        economy.

        However, even if trade increases the overall wage level, it will
        still benefit some workers and hurt others. Workers in
        industries that are confronted by competition from imported
        products may find that demand for their labor decreases and
        shifts back to the left, so that their wages decline with a rise
        in international trade. Conversely, workers in industries that
        benefit from selling in global markets may find that demand for
        their labor shifts out to the right, so that trade raises their
        wages.

        <span id="bookmark1684">One concern is that while globalization
        may be benefiting high-skilled, high-wage workers in the United
        States, it may also impose costs on low-skilled, low-wage
        workers. After all, high-skilled U.S. workers presumably benefit
        from increased sales of sophisticated products like computers,
        machinery, and pharmaceuticals in which the United States has a
        comparative advantage. Meanwhile, low-skilled U.S. workers must
        now compete against extremely low- wage workers worldwide for
        making simpler products like toys and clothing. As a result, the
        wages of low-skilled</span><span id="bookmark1685">‌</span>

        U.S. workers are likely to fall. There are, however, a number of
        reasons to believe that while globalization has helped some U.S.
        industries and hurt others, it has not focused its negative
        impact on the wages of low-skilled Americans. First, about half
        of U.S. trade is intra-industry trade. That means the U.S.
        trades similar goods with other high-wage economies like Canada,
        Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom. For instance, in 2014
        the U.S. exported over 2 million cars, from all the major
        automakers, and also imported several million cars from other
        countries.

        Most U.S. workers in these industries have above-average skills
        and wages—and many of them do quite well in the world of
        globalization. Some evidence suggested that intra-industry trade
        between similar countries had a small impact on domestic workers
        but later evidence indicates that it all depends on how flexible
        the labor market is. In other words, the key is how flexible
        workers are in finding jobs in different industries. The effect
        of trade on low- wage workers depends considerably on the
        structure of labor markets and indirect effects felt in other
        parts of the economy. For example, in the United States and the
        United Kingdom, because labor market frictions are low, the
        impact of trade on low income workers is small.

        Second, many low-skilled U.S. workers hold service jobs that
        imports from low-wage countries cannot replace. For example, we
        cannot import lawn care services or moving and hauling services
        or hotel maids from countries long distances away like China or
        Bangladesh. Competition from imported products is not the
        primary determinant of their wages.

        Finally, while the focus of the discussion here is on wages, it
        is worth pointing out that low-wage U.S. workers suffer due to
        protectionism in all the industries—even those in which they do
        not work. For example, food and clothing are protected
        industries. These low-wage workers therefore pay higher prices
        for these basic necessities and as such their dollar stretches
        over fewer goods.

        The benefits and costs of increased trade in terms of its effect
        on wages are not distributed evenly across the economy. However,
        the growth of international trade has helped to raise the
        productivity of U.S. workers as a whole—and thus helped to raise
        the average level of wages.

        Labor Standards and Working Conditions

        <span id="bookmark1686">Workers in many low-income countries
        around the world labor under conditions that would be illegal
        for a worker in the United States. Workers in countries like
        China, Thailand, Brazil, South Africa, and Poland are often paid
        less than the United States minimum wage. For example, in the
        United States, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour. A typical
        wage in many low-income countries might be more like $7.25 per
        day, or often much less. Moreover, working conditions in
        low-income countries may be extremely unpleasant, or even
        unsafe. In the worst cases, production may involve the child
        labor or even workers who are treated nearly like slaves. These
        concerns over foreign labor standards do not affect most of U.S.
        trade, which is intra-industry and carried out with other
        high-income countries that have labor standards similar to the
        United States, but it is, nonetheless, morally and economically
        important.</span>

          

          

        In thinking about labor standards in other countries, it is
        important to draw some distinctions between what is truly
        unacceptable and what is painful to think about. Most people,
        economists included, have little difficulty with the idea that
        production by six-year-olds confined in factories or by slave
        labor is morally unacceptable. They would support aggressive
        efforts to eliminate such practices—including shutting out
        imported products made with such labor. Many cases, however, are
        less clear-cut. An opinion article in the *New York Times*
        several years ago described the case of Ahmed Zia, a 14-year-old
        boy from Pakistan. He earned $2 per day working in a carpet
        factory. He dropped out of school in second grade. Should the
        United States and other countries refuse to purchase rugs made
        by Ahmed and his co-workers? If the carpet factories were to
        close, the likely alternative job for Ahmed is farm work, and as
        Ahmed says of his carpet-weaving job: “This makes much more
        money and is more comfortable.”

        Other workers may have even less attractive alternative jobs,
        perhaps scavenging garbage or prostitution. The real problem for
        Ahmed and many others in low-income countries is not that
        globalization has made their lives worse, but rather that they
        have so few good life alternatives. The United States went
        through similar situations during the nineteenth and early
        twentieth centuries.

        In closing, there is some irony when the United States
        government or U.S. citizens take issue with labor standards in
        low-income countries, because the United States is not a world
        leader in government laws to protect employees. According to a
        recent study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
        Development (OECD), the U.S. is the only one of 41 countries
        that does not provide mandated paid leave for new parents, and
        among the 40 countries that do mandate paid leave, the minimum
        duration is about two months. Many European workers receive six
        weeks or more of paid vacation per year. In the United States,
        vacations are often one to three weeks per year. If European
        countries accused the United States of using unfair labor
        standards to make U.S. products cheaply, and announced that they
        would shut out all U.S. imports until the United States adopted
        paid parental leave, added more national holidays, and doubled
        vacation time, Americans would be outraged. Yet when U.S.
        protectionists start talking about restricting imports from poor
        countries because of low wage levels and poor working
        conditions, they are making a very similar argument. This is not
        to say that labor conditions in low-income countries are not an
        important issue. They are. However, linking labor conditions in
        low-income countries to trade deflects the emphasis from the
        real question to ask: “What are acceptable and enforceable
        minimum labor standards and protections to have the world over?”

          

3.  <span id="bookmark1654">|</span> <span
    style=" color: #3767B1;">Arguments in Support of Restricting
    Imports</span><span id="bookmark1687">‌</span>

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Explain and analyze various arguments that are in support of
        restricting imports, including the infant industry argument, the
        anti-dumping argument, the environmental protection argument,
        the unsafe consumer products argument, and the national interest
        argument

    -   Explain dumping and race to the bottom

    -   Evaluate the significance of countries’ perceptions on the
        benefits of growing trade

          

        As we previously noted, protectionism requires domestic
        consumers of a product to pay higher prices to benefit domestic
        producers of that product. Countries that institute
        protectionist policies lose the economic gains achieved through
        a combination of comparative advantage, specialized learning,
        and economies of scale. With these overall costs in mind, let us
        now consider, one by one, a number of arguments that support
        restricting imports.

        The Infant Industry Argument

        <a href="#bookmark1530" id="bookmark1688" class="s34">Imagine Bhutan wants to start its own computer industry, but it has no computer firms that can produce at a low enough price and high enough quality to compete in world markets. However, Bhutanese politicians, business leaders, and workers hope that if the local industry had a chance to get established, before it needed to face international competition, then a domestic company or group of companies could develop the skills, management, technology, and economies of scale that it needs to become a successful profit-earning domestic industry. Thus, the infant industry argument for protectionism is to block imports for a limited time, to give the infant industry time to mature, before it starts competing on equal terms in the global economy. (Revisit</a>
        <a href="#bookmark1530" class="a">Macroeconomic Policy Around the World</a>
        <span class="p">for more information on the infant industry
        argument.)</span>

        The infant industry argument is theoretically possible, even
        sensible: give an industry a short-term indirect subsidy

          

          

        through protection, and then reap the long-term economic
        benefits of having a vibrant, healthy industry. Implementation,
        however, is tricky. In many countries, infant industries have
        gone from babyhood to senility and obsolescence without ever
        having reached the profitable maturity stage. Meanwhile, the
        protectionism that was supposed to be short-term often took a
        very long time to be repealed.

        As one example, Brazil treated its computer industry as an
        infant industry from the late 1970s until about 1990. In an
        attempt to establish its computer industry in the global
        economy, Brazil largely barred imports of computer products for
        several decades. This policy guaranteed increased sales for
        Brazilian computers. However, by the mid-1980s, due to lack of
        international competition, Brazil had a backward and out-of-date
        industry, typically lagging behind world standards for price and
        performance by three to five years—a long time in this
        fast-moving industry. After more than a decade, during which
        Brazilian consumers and industries that would have benefited
        from up-to-date computers paid the costs and Brazil’s computer
        industry never competed effectively on world markets, Brazil
        phased out its infant industry policy for the computer industry.

        Protectionism for infant industries always imposes costs on
        domestic users of the product, and typically has provided little
        benefit in the form of stronger, competitive industries.
        However, several countries in East Asia offer an exception.
        Japan, Korea, Thailand, and other countries in this region have
        sometimes provided a package of indirect and direct subsidies
        targeted at certain industries, including protection from
        foreign competition and government loans at interest rates below
        the market equilibrium. In Japan and Korea, for example,
        subsidies helped get their domestic steel and auto industries up
        and running.

        Why did the infant industry policy of protectionism and other
        subsidies work fairly well in East Asia? An early 1990 World
        Bank study offered three guidelines to countries thinking about
        infant industry protection:

        1.  Do not hand out protectionism and other subsidies to all
            industries, but focus on a few industries where your country
            has a realistic chance to be a world-class producer.

        2.  Be very hesitant about using protectionism in areas like
            computers, where many other industries rely on having the
            best products available, because it is not useful to help
            one industry by imposing high costs on many other
            industries.

        3.  Have clear guidelines for when the infant industry policy
            will end.

        In Korea in the 1970s and 1980s, a common practice was to link
        protectionism and subsidies to export sales in global markets.
        If export sales rose, then the infant industry had succeeded and
        the government could phase out protectionism. If export sales
        did not rise, then the infant industry policy had failed and the
        government could phase out protectionism. Either way, the
        protectionism would be temporary.

        Following these rules is easier said than done. Politics often
        intrudes, both in choosing which industries will receive the
        benefits of treatment as “infants” and when to phase out import
        restrictions and other subsidies. Also, if the country's
        government wishes to impose costs on its citizens so that it can
        provide subsidies to a few key industries, it has many tools for
        doing such as direct government payments, loans, targeted tax
        reductions, and government support of research and development
        of new technologies. In other words, protectionism is not the
        only or even the best way to support key industries.

          

          

        The Anti-Dumping Argument

        <span id="bookmark1689">Dumping</span> <span class="p">refers to
        selling goods below their cost of production.
        </span>Anti-dumping laws <span class="p">block imports that are
        sold below the cost of production by imposing tariffs that
        increase the price of these imports to reflect their cost of
        production. Since dumping is not allowed under World Trade
        Organization (WTO) rules, nations that believe they are on the
        receiving end of dumped goods can file a complaint with the WTO.
        Anti-dumping complaints have risen in recent years, from about
        100 cases per year in the late 1980s to about 200 new cases each
        year by the late 2000s. Note that dumping cases are
        countercyclical. During recessions, case filings increase.
        During economic booms, case filings go down. Individual
        countries have also frequently started their own anti-dumping
        investigations. The U.S. government has dozens of anti-dumping
        orders in place from past investigations. In 2009, for example,
        some U.S. imports that were under anti-dumping orders included
        pasta from Turkey, steel pipe fittings from Thailand, pressure-
        sensitive plastic tape from Italy, preserved mushrooms and lined
        paper products from India, and cut-to-length carbon steel and
        non-frozen apple juice concentrate from China.</span><span
        id="bookmark1690">‌</span>

        Why Might Dumping Occur?

        Why would foreign firms export a product at less than its cost
        of production—which presumably means taking a loss? This
        question has two possible answers, one innocent and one more
        sinister.

        The innocent explanation is that demand and supply set market
        prices, not the cost of production. Perhaps demand for a product
        shifts back to the left or supply shifts out to the right, which
        drives the market price to low levels—even below the cost of
        production. When a local store has a going-out-of-business sale,
        for example, it may sell goods at below the cost of production.
        If international companies find that there is excess supply of
        steel or computer chips or machine tools that is driving the
        market price down below their cost of production—this may be the
        market in action.

        <a href="http://cnx.org/content/m63911/latest/" class="s34">The sinister explanation is that dumping is part of a long-term strategy. Foreign firms sell goods at prices below the cost of production for a short period of time, and when they have driven out the domestic U.S. competition, they then raise prices. Economists sometimes call this scenario predatory pricing, which we discuss in the</a>
        <a href="http://cnx.org/content/m63911/latest/" class="a">Monopoly</a>
        (http://cnx.org/content/m63911/latest/) <span
        class="p">chapter.</span>

        Should Anti-Dumping Cases Be Limited?

        Anti-dumping cases pose two questions. How much sense do they
        make in economic theory? How much sense do they make as
        practical policy?

        In terms of economic theory, the case for anti-dumping laws is
        weak. In a market governed by demand and supply, the government
        does not guarantee that firms will be able to make a profit.
        After all, low prices are difficult for producers, but benefit
        consumers. Moreover, although there are plenty of cases in which
        foreign producers have driven out domestic firms, there are zero
        documented cases in which the foreign producers then jacked up
        prices. Instead, foreign producers typically continue competing
        hard against each other and providing low prices to consumers.
        In short, it is difficult to find evidence of predatory pricing
        by foreign firms exporting to the United States.

        Even if one could make a case that the government should
        sometimes enact anti-dumping rules in the short term, and then
        allow free trade to resume shortly thereafter, there is a
        growing concern that anti-dumping investigations often involve
        more politics than careful analysis. The U.S. Commerce
        Department is charged with calculating the appropriate “cost of
        production,” which can be as much an art as a science.

        For example, if a company built a new factory two years ago,
        should it count part of the factory’s cost in this year’s cost
        of production? When a company is in a country where the
        government controls prices, like China for example, how can one
        measure the true cost of production? When a domestic industry
        complains loudly enough, government regulators seem very likely
        to find that unfair dumping has occurred. A common pattern has
        arisen where a domestic industry files an anti-dumping
        complaint, the governments meet and negotiate a reduction in
        imports, and then the domestic producers drop the anti-dumping
        suit. In such cases, anti-dumping cases often appear to be
        little more than a cover story for imposing tariffs or import
        quotas.

        In the 1980s, the United States, Canada, the European Union,
        Australia, and New Zealand implemented almost all the
        anti-dumping cases. By the 2000s, countries like Argentina,
        Brazil, South Korea, South Africa, Mexico, and India were filing
        the majority of the anti-dumping cases before the WTO. As the
        number of anti-dumping cases has increased, and as countries
        such as the United States and the European Union feel targeted
        by the anti-dumping actions of others, the WTO may well propose
        some additional guidelines to limit the reach of anti-dumping
        laws.

          

        The Environmental Protection Argument

        The potential for global trade to affect the environment has
        become controversial. A president of the Sierra Club, an
        environmental lobbying organization, once wrote: “The
        consequences of globalization for the environment are not good.
        … Globalization, if we are lucky, will raise average incomes
        enough to pay for cleaning up some of the mess that we have
        made. But before we get there, globalization could also destroy
        enough of the planet’s basic biological and physical systems
        that prospects for life itself will be radically compromised.”

        <span id="bookmark1691">If free trade meant the destruction of
        life itself, then even economists would convert to
        protectionism! While globalization—and economic activity of all
        kinds—can pose environmental dangers, it seems quite possible
        that, with the appropriate safeguards in place, we can minimize
        the environmental impacts of trade. In some cases, trade may
        even bring environmental benefits.</span>

        <span id="bookmark1692">In general, high-income countries such
        as the United States, Canada, Japan, and the nations of the
        European Union have relatively strict environmental standards.
        In contrast, middle- and low-income countries like Brazil,
        Nigeria, India, and China have lower environmental standards.
        The general view of the governments of such countries is that
        environmental protection is a luxury: as soon as their people
        have enough to eat, decent healthcare, and longer life
        expectancies, then they will spend more money on items such as
        sewage treatment plants, scrubbers to reduce air pollution from
        factory smokestacks, and national parks to protect
        wildlife.</span><span id="bookmark1693">‌</span>

        This gap in environmental standards between high-income and
        low-income countries raises two worrisome possibilities in a
        world of increasing global trade: the “race to the bottom”
        scenario and the question of how quickly environmental standards
        will improve in low-income countries.

        The Race to the Bottom Scenario

        <span id="bookmark1694">The</span> **race to the bottom**
        scenario of global environmental degradation runs like this.
        Profit-seeking multinational companies shift their production
        from countries with strong environmental standards to countries
        with weak standards, thus reducing their costs and increasing
        their profits. Faced with such behavior, countries reduce their
        environmental standards to attract multinational firms, which,
        after all, provide jobs and economic clout. As a result, global
        production becomes concentrated in countries where firms can
        pollute the most and environmental laws everywhere “race to the
        bottom.”

        Although the race-to-the-bottom scenario sounds plausible, it
        does not appear to describe reality. In fact, the financial
        incentive for firms to shift production to poor countries to
        take advantage of their weaker environmental rules does not seem
        especially powerful. When firms decide where to locate a new
        factory, they look at many different factors: the costs of labor
        and financial capital; whether the location is close to a
        reliable suppliers of the inputs that they need; whether the
        location is close to customers; the quality of transportation,
        communications, and electrical power networks; the level of
        taxes; and the competence and honesty of the local government.
        The cost of environmental regulations is a factor, too, but
        typically environmental costs are no more than 1 to 2% of the
        costs that a large industrial plant faces. The other factors
        that determine location are much more important to these
        companies than trying to skimp on environmental protection
        costs.

        When an international company does choose to build a plant in a
        low-income country with lax environmental laws, it typically
        builds a plant similar to those that it operates in high-income
        countries with stricter environmental standards. Part of the
        reason for this decision is that designing an industrial plant
        is a complex and costly task, and so if a plant works well in a
        high-income country, companies prefer to use the same design
        everywhere. Also, companies realize that if they create an
        environmental disaster in a low-income country, it is likely to
        cost them a substantial amount of money in paying for damages,
        lost trust, and reduced sales—by building up-to-date plants
        everywhere they minimize such risks. As a result of these
        factors, foreign-owned plants in low-income countries often have
        a better record of compliance with environmental laws than do
        locally-owned plants.

        Pressuring Low-Income Countries for Higher Environmental
        Standards

        In some cases, the issue is not so much whether globalization
        will pressure low-income countries to reduce their environmental
        standards, but instead whether the threat of blocking
        international trade can pressure these countries into adopting
        stronger standards. For example, restrictions on ivory imports
        in high-income countries, along with stronger government efforts
        to catch elephant poachers, have been credited with helping to
        reduce the illegal poaching of elephants in certain African
        countries.

        However, it would be highly undemocratic for the well-fed
        citizens of high-income countries to attempt to dictate to the
        ill-fed citizens of low-income countries what domestic policies
        and priorities they must adopt, or how they

          

          

        should balance environmental goals against other priorities for
        their citizens. Furthermore, if high-income countries want
        stronger environmental standards in low-income countries, they
        have many options other than the threat of protectionism. For
        example, high-income countries could pay for anti-pollution
        equipment in low-income countries, or could help to pay for
        national parks. High-income countries could help pay for and
        carry out the scientific and economic studies that would help
        environmentalists in low-income countries to make a more
        persuasive case for the economic benefits of protecting the
        environment.

        After all, environmental protection is vital to two industries
        of key importance in many low-income countries—agriculture and
        tourism. Environmental advocates can set up standards for
        labeling products, like “this tuna caught in a net that kept
        dolphins safe” or “this product made only with wood not taken
        from rainforests,” so that consumer pressure can reinforce
        environmentalist values. The United Nations also reinforces
        these values, by sponsoring treaties to address issues such as
        climate change and global warming, the preservation of
        biodiversity, the spread of deserts, and the environmental
        health of the seabed. Countries that share a national border or
        are within a region often sign environmental agreements about
        air and water rights, too. The WTO is also becoming more aware
        of environmental issues and more careful about ensuring that
        increases in trade do not inflict environmental damage.

        Finally, note that these concerns about the race to the bottom
        or pressuring low-income countries for more strict environmental
        standards do not apply very well to the roughly half of all U.S.
        trade that occurs with other high-income countries. Many
        European countries have stricter environmental standards in
        certain industries than the United States.

        The Unsafe Consumer Products Argument

        One argument for shutting out certain imported products is that
        they are unsafe for consumers. Consumer rights groups have
        sometimes warned that the World Trade Organization would require
        nations to reduce their health and safety standards for imported
        products. However, the WTO explains its current agreement on the
        subject in this way: “It allows countries to set their own
        standards.” It also says “regulations must be based on science.
        And they

        should not arbitrarily or unjustifiably discriminate between
        countries where identical or similar conditions prevail.” Thus,
        for example, under WTO rules it is perfectly legitimate for the
        United States to pass laws requiring that *all* food products or
        cars sold in the United States meet certain safety standards
        approved by the United States government, whether or not other
        countries choose to pass similar standards. However, such
        standards must have some scientific basis. It is improper to
        impose one set of health and safety standards for domestically
        produced goods but a different set of standards for imports, or
        one set of standards for imports from Europe and a different set
        of standards for imports from Latin America.

        In 2007, Mattel recalled nearly two million toys imported from
        China due to concerns about high levels of lead in the paint, as
        well as some loose parts. It is unclear if other toys were
        subject to similar standards. More recently, in 2013, Japan
        blocked imports of U.S. wheat because of concerns that
        genetically modified (GMO) wheat might be included in the
        shipments. The science on the impact of GMOs on health is still
        developing.

        The National Interest Argument

        Some argue that a nation should not depend too heavily on other
        countries for supplies of certain key products, such as oil, or
        for special materials or technologies that might have national
        security applications. On closer consideration, this argument
        for protectionism proves rather weak.

        As an example, in the United States, oil provides about 36% of
        all the energy and 25% of the oil used in the United States
        economy is imported. Several times in the last few decades, when
        disruptions in the Middle East have shifted the supply curve of
        oil back to the left and sharply raised the price, the effects
        have been felt across the United States economy. This is not,
        however, a very convincing argument for restricting oil imports.
        If the United States needs to be protected from a possible
        cutoff of foreign oil, then a more reasonable strategy would be
        to import 100% of the petroleum supply now, and save U.S.
        domestic oil resources for when or if the foreign supply is cut
        off. It might also be useful to import extra oil and put it into
        a stockpile for use in an emergency, as the United States
        government did by starting a Strategic Petroleum Reserve
        in 1977. Moreover, it may be necessary to discourage people from
        using oil, and to start a high-powered program to seek out
        alternatives to oil. A straightforward way to do this would be
        to raise taxes on oil. Additionally, it makes no sense to argue
        that because oil is highly important to the United States
        economy, then the United States should shut out oil imports and
        use up its domestic supplies more quickly. U.S. domestic oil
        production is increasing. Shale oil is adding to domestic supply
        using fracking extraction techniques.

        Whether or not to limit certain kinds of imports of key
        technologies or materials that might be important to national
        security and weapons systems is a slightly different issue. If
        weapons’ builders are not confident that they can

        How does the United States really feel about expanding trade?

        <a href="#bookmark1695" class="s84">How do people around the world feel about expanding trade between nations? In summer 2007, the Pew Foundation surveyed 45,000 people in 47 countries. One of the questions asked about opinions on growing trade ties between countries.</a>
        Table 21.3 <span class="s37">shows the percentages who answered
        either “very good” or “somewhat good” for some of countries
        surveyed.</span>

        For those who think of the United States as the world’s leading
        supporter of expanding trade, the survey results may be
        perplexing. When adding up the shares of those who say that
        growing trade ties between countries is “very good” or “somewhat
        good,” Americans had the least favorable attitude toward
        increasing globalization, while the Chinese and South Africans
        ranked highest. In fact, among the 47 countries surveyed, the
        United States ranked by far the lowest on this measure, followed
        by Egypt, Italy, and Argentina.

        continue to obtain a key product in wartime, they might decide
        to avoid designing weapons that use this key product, or they
        can go ahead and design the weapons and stockpile enough of the
        key high-tech components or materials to last through an armed
        conflict. There is a U.S. Defense National Stockpile Center that
        has built up reserves of many materials, from aluminum oxides,
        antimony, and bauxite to tungsten, vegetable tannin extracts,
        and zinc (although many of these stockpiles have been reduced
        and sold in recent years). Think every country is pro-trade? How
        about the U.S.? The following Clear It Up might surprise you.

        <span id="bookmark1696">One final reason why economists often
        treat the</span> **national interest argument** skeptically is
        that lobbyists and politicians can tout almost any product as
        vital to national security. In 1954, the United States became
        worried that it was importing half of the wool required for
        military uniforms, so it declared wool and mohair to be
        “strategic materials” and began to give subsidies to wool and
        mohair farmers. Although the government removed wool from the
        official list of “strategic” materials in 1960, the subsidies
        for mohair continued for almost 40 years until the government
        repealed them in 1993, and then reinstated them in 2002. All too
        often, the national interest argument has become an excuse for
        handing out the indirect subsidy of protectionism to certain
        industries or companies. After all, politicians, not nonpartisan
        analysts make decisions about what constitutes a key strategic
        material.

    Governments Enact Trade Policy: Globally, Regionally, and
    Nationally</span><span id="bookmark1697">‌</span>

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Explain the origin and role of the World Trade Organization
        (WTO) and General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)

    -   Discuss the significance and provide examples of regional
        trading agreements

    -   Analyze trade policy at the national level

    -   Evaluate long-term trends in barriers to trade

          

        These public policy arguments about how nations should react to
        globalization and trade are fought out at several levels: at the
        global level through the World Trade Organization and through
        regional trade agreements between pairs or groups of countries.

        The World Trade Organization

        <span id="bookmark1698">The World Trade Organization (WTO) was
        officially born in 1995, but its history is much longer. In the
        years after the Great Depression and World War II, there was a
        worldwide push to build institutions that would tie the nations
        of the world together. The United Nations officially came into
        existence in 1945. The World Bank, which assists the poorest
        people in the world, and the International Monetary Fund, which
        addresses issues raised by international financial transactions,
        were both created in 1946. The third planned organization was to
        be an International Trade Organization, which would manage
        international trade. The United Nations was unable to agree to
        this. Instead, 27 nations signed the</span> **General Agreement
        on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)** in Geneva, Switzerland on October
        30, 1947 to provide a forum in which nations could come together
        to negotiate reductions in tariffs and other barriers to trade.
        In 1995, the GATT transformed into the WTO.<span
        id="bookmark1699">‌</span>

        <a href="#bookmark1700" class="s34">The GATT process was to negotiate an agreement to reduce barriers to trade, sign that agreement, pause for a while, and then start negotiating the next agreement.</a>
        <a href="#bookmark1700" class="a">Table 21.4</a> <span
        class="p">shows rounds of talks in the GATT, and now the WTO.
        Notice that the early rounds of GATT talks took a relatively
        short time, included a small number of countries, and focused
        almost entirely on reducing tariffs. Since the mid-1960s,
        however, rounds of trade talks have taken years, included a
        large number of countries, and have included an ever-broadening
        range of issues.</span>

        Table 21.4 The Negotiating Rounds of GATT and the World Trade
        Organization

          

        The sluggish pace of GATT negotiations led to an old joke that
        GATT really stood for Gentleman’s Agreement to Talk and Talk.
        The slow pace of international trade talks, however, is
        understandable, even sensible. Having dozens of nations agree to
        any treaty is a lengthy process. GATT often set up separate
        trading rules for certain industries, like agriculture, and
        separate trading rules for certain countries, like the
        low-income countries. There were rules, exceptions to rules,
        opportunities to opt out of rules, and precise wording to be
        fought over in every case. Like the GATT before it, the WTO is
        not a world government, with power to impose its decisions on
        others. The total staff of the WTO in 2014 is 640 people and its
        annual budget (as of 2014) is $197 million, which makes it
        smaller in size than many large universities.

        Regional Trading Agreements

        <span id="bookmark1701">There are different types of economic
        integration across the globe, ranging from</span> **free trade
        agreements**, in which participants allow each other’s imports
        without tariffs or quotas, to **common markets**, in which
        participants have a common external trade policy as well as free
        trade within the group, to full **economic unions**, in which,
        in addition to a common market, monetary and fiscal policies are
        coordinated. Many nations belong both to the World Trade
        Organization and to regional trading agreements.<span
        id="bookmark1702">‌</span><span id="bookmark1703">‌</span>

        <span id="bookmark1704">The best known of these regional trading
        agreements is the European Union. In the years after World War
        II, leaders of several European nations reasoned that if they
        could tie their economies together more closely, they might be
        more likely to avoid another devastating war. Their efforts
        began with a free trade association, evolved into a common
        market, and then transformed into what is now a full economic
        union, known as the European Union. The EU, as it is often
        called, has a number of goals. For example, in the early 2000s
        it introduced a common currency for Europe, the euro, and phased
        out most of the former national forms of money like the German
        mark and the French franc, though a few have retained their own
        currency. Another key element of the union is to eliminate
        barriers to the mobility of goods, labor, and capital across
        Europe.</span>

        <span id="bookmark1705">For the United States, perhaps the
        best-known regional trading agreement is the North American Free
        Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The United States also participates in
        some less-prominent regional trading agreements, like the
        Caribbean Basin Initiative, which offers reduced tariffs for
        imports from these countries, and a free trade agreement with
        Israel.</span>

        <a href="#bookmark1706" class="s34">The world has seen a flood of regional trading agreements in recent years. About 100 such agreements are now in place.</a>
        <a href="#bookmark1706" class="a">Table 21.5</a> <span
        class="p">lists a few of the more prominent ones. Some are just
        agreements to continue talking. Others set specific goals for
        reducing tariffs, import quotas, and nontariff barriers. One
        economist described the current trade treaties as a “spaghetti
        bowl,” which is what a map with lines connecting all the
        countries with trade treaties looks like.</span>

        There is concern among economists who favor free trade that some
        of these regional agreements may promise free trade, but
        actually act as a way for the countries within the regional
        agreement to try to limit trade from anywhere else. In some
        cases, the regional trade agreements may even conflict with the
        broader agreements of the World Trade Organization.

        Trade Policy at the National Level

        Yet another dimension of trade policy, along with international
        and regional trade agreements, happens at the national level.
        The United States, for example, imposes import quotas on sugar,
        because of a fear that such imports would drive down the price
        of sugar and thus injure domestic sugar producers. One of the
        jobs of the United States Department of Commerce is to determine
        if there is import dumping from other countries. The United
        States International Trade Commission—a government
        agency—determines whether the dumping has substantially injured
        domestic industries, and if so, the president can impose tariffs
        that are intended to offset the unfairly low price.

        In the arena of trade policy, the battle often seems to be
        between national laws that increase protectionism and
        international agreements that try to reduce protectionism, like
        the WTO. Why would a country pass laws or negotiate agreements
        to shut out certain foreign products, like sugar or textiles,
        while simultaneously negotiating to reduce trade barriers in
        general? One plausible answer is that international trade
        agreements offer a method for countries to restrain their own
        special interests. A member of Congress can say to an industry
        lobbying for tariffs or quotas on imports: “Sure would like to
        help you, but that pesky WTO agreement just won’t let me.”

        Long-Term Trends in Barriers to Trade

        In newspaper headlines, trade policy appears mostly as disputes
        and acrimony. Countries are almost constantly threatening to
        challenge other nations' “unfair” trading practices. Cases are
        brought to the dispute settlement procedures of the WTO, the
        European Union, NAFTA, and other regional trading agreements.
        Politicians in national legislatures, goaded on by lobbyists,
        often threaten to pass bills that will “establish a fair playing
        field” or “prevent unfair trade”—although most such bills seek
        to accomplish these high-sounding goals by placing more
        restrictions on trade. Protesters in the streets may object to
        specific trade rules or to the entire practice of international
        trade.

        Through all the controversy, the general trend in the last 60
        years is clearly toward lower barriers to trade. The average
        level of tariffs on imported products charged by industrialized
        countries was 40% in 1946. By 1990, after decades of GATT
        negotiations, it was down to less than 5%. One of the reasons
        that GATT negotiations shifted from focusing on tariff reduction
        in the early rounds to a broader agenda was that tariffs had
        been reduced so dramatically there was not much more to do in
        that area. U.S. tariffs have followed this general pattern:
        After rising sharply during the Great Depression, tariffs
        dropped off to less than 2% by the end of the century. Although
        measures of import quotas and nontariff barriers are less exact
        than those for tariffs, they generally appear to be at lower
        levels than they had been previously, too.

        Thus, the last half-century has seen both a dramatic reduction
        in government-created barriers to trade, such as tariffs, import
        quotas, and nontariff barriers, and also a number of
        technological developments that have made international trade
        easier, like advances in transportation, communication, and
        information management. The result has been the powerful surge
        of international trade.

          

5.  <span id="bookmark1656">|</span> <span style=" color: #3767B1;">The
    Tradeoffs of Trade Policy</span><span id="bookmark1707">‌</span>

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    -   Asses the complexity of international trade

    -   Discuss why a market-oriented economy is so affected by
        international trade

    -   Explain disruptive market change

  

Economists readily acknowledge that international trade is not all
sunshine, roses, and happy endings. Over time, the average person gains
from international trade, both as a worker who has greater productivity
and higher wages because of the benefits of specialization and
comparative advantage, and as a consumer who can benefit from shopping
all over the world for a greater variety of quality products at
attractive prices. The “average person,” however, is hypothetical, not
real—representing a mix of those who have done very well, those who have
done all right, and those who have done poorly. It is a legitimate
concern of public policy to focus not just on the average or on the
success stories, but also on those who have not been so fortunate.
Workers in other countries, the environment, and prospects for new
industries and materials that might be of key importance to the national
economy are also all

  

  

legitimate issues.

The common belief among economists is that it is better to embrace the
gains from trade, and then deal with the costs and tradeoffs with other
policy tools, than it is to cut off trade to avoid the costs and
tradeoffs.

To gain a better intuitive understanding for this argument, consider a
hypothetical American company called Technotron. Technotron invents a
new scientific technology that allows the firm to increase the output
and quality of its goods with a smaller number of workers at a lower
cost. As a result of this technology, other U.S. firms in this industry
will lose money and will also have to lay off workers—and some of the
competing firms will even go bankrupt. Should the United States
government protect the existing firms and their employees by making it
illegal for Technotron to use its new technology? Most people who live
in market-oriented economies would oppose trying to block better
products that lower the cost of services. Certainly, there is a case for
society providing temporary support and assistance for those who find
themselves without work. Many would argue for government support of
programs that encourage retraining and acquiring additional skills.
Government might also support research and development efforts, so that
other firms may find ways of outdoing Technotron. Blocking the new
technology altogether, however, seems like a mistake. After all, few
people would advocate giving up electricity because it caused so much
disruption to the kerosene and candle business. Few would suggest
holding back on improvements in medical technology because they might
cause companies selling leeches and snake oil to lose money. In short,
most people view disruptions due to technological change as a necessary
cost that is worth bearing.

<span id="bookmark1708">Now, imagine that Technotron’s new “technology”
is as simple as this: the company imports what it sells from another
country. In other words, think of foreign trade as a type of innovative
technology. The objective situation is now exactly the same as before.
Because of Technotron’s new technology—which in this case is importing
goods from another county—other firms in this industry will lose money
and lay off workers. Just as it would have been inappropriate and
ultimately foolish to respond to the disruptions of new scientific
technology by trying to shut it down, it would be inappropriate and
ultimately foolish to respond to the disruptions of international trade
by trying to restrict trade.</span>

Some workers and firms will suffer because of international trade. In a
living, breathing market-oriented economy, some workers and firms will
always be experiencing disruptions, for a wide variety of reasons.
Corporate management can be better or worse. Workers for a certain firm
can be more or less productive. Tough domestic competitors can create
just as much disruption as tough foreign competitors. Sometimes a new
product is a hit with consumers; sometimes it is a flop. Sometimes a
company is blessed by a run of good luck or stricken with a run of bad
luck. For some firms, international trade will offer great opportunities
for expanding productivity and jobs; for other firms, trade will impose
stress and pain. The disruption caused by international trade is not
fundamentally different from all the other disruptions caused by the
other workings of a market economy.

What’s the Downside of Protection?

The domestic flat-panel display industry employed many workers before
the ITC imposed the dumping margin tax. Flat-panel displays make up a
significant portion of the cost of producing laptop computers—as much as
50%. Therefore, the antidumping tax would substantially increase the
cost, and thus the price, of U.S.- manufactured laptops. As a result of
the ITC’s decision, Apple moved its domestic manufacturing plant for
Macintosh computers to Ireland (where it had an existing plant). Toshiba
shut down its U.S. manufacturing plant for laptops. And IBM cancelled
plans to open a laptop manufacturing plant in North Carolina, instead
deciding to expand production at its plant in Japan. In this case,
rather than having the desired effect of protecting U.S. interests and
giving domestic manufacturing an advantage over items manufactured
elsewhere, it had the unintended effect of driving the manufacturing
completely out of the country. Many

<span id="bookmark1709">In other words, the economic analysis of free
trade does not rely on a belief that foreign trade is not disruptive or
does not pose tradeoffs; indeed, the story of Technotron begins with a
particular</span> **disruptive market change**—a new technology—that
causes real tradeoffs. In thinking about the disruptions of foreign
trade, or any of the other possible costs and tradeoffs of foreign trade
discussed in this chapter, the best public policy solutions typically do
not involve protectionism, but instead involve finding ways for public
policy to address the particular issues resulting from these
disruptions, costs, and tradeoffs, while still allowing the benefits of
international trade to occur.

KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY

  

1.  <a href="#bookmark1660" class="a">Protectionism: An Indirect Subsidy from Consumers to</a>
    [Producers](#bookmark1660)

    There are three tools for restricting the flow of trade: tariffs,
    import quotas, and nontariff barriers. When a country places
    limitations on imports from abroad, regardless of whether it uses
    tariffs, quotas, or nontariff barriers, it is said to be practicing
    protectionism. Protectionism will raise the price of the protected
    good in the domestic market, which causes domestic consumers to pay
    more, but domestic producers to earn more.

      

2.  <a href="#bookmark1679" class="a">International Trade and Its Effects on Jobs, Wages, and Working</a>
    [Conditions](#bookmark1679)

    As international trade increases, it contributes to a shift in jobs
    away from industries where that economy does not have a comparative
    advantage and toward industries where it does have a comparative
    advantage. The degree to which trade affects labor markets has much
    to do with the structure of the labor market in that country and the
    adjustment process in other industries. Global trade should raise
    the average level of wages by increasing productivity. However, this
    increase in average wages may include both gains to workers in
    certain jobs and industries and losses to others.

      

      

    In thinking about labor practices in low-income countries, it is
    useful to draw a line between what is unpleasant to think about and
    what is morally objectionable. For example, low wages and long
    working hours in poor countries are unpleasant to think about, but
    for people in low-income parts of the world, it may well be the best
    option open to them. Practices like child labor and forced labor are
    morally objectionable and many countries refuse to import products
    made using these practices.

      

3.  <a href="#bookmark1687" class="a">Arguments in Support of Restricting</a>
    [Imports](#bookmark1687)

    There are a number of arguments that support restricting imports.
    These arguments are based around industry and competition,
    environmental concerns, and issues of safety and security.

    The infant industry argument for protectionism is that small
    domestic industries need to be temporarily nurtured and protected
    from foreign competition for a time so that they can grow into
    strong competitors. In some cases, notably in East Asia, this
    approach has worked. Often, however, the infant industries never
    grow up. On the other hand, arguments against dumping (which is
    setting prices below the cost of production to drive competitors out
    of the market), often simply seem to be a convenient excuse for
    imposing protectionism.

    Low-income countries typically have lower environmental standards
    than high-income countries because they are more worried about
    immediate basics such as food, education, and healthcare. However,
    except for a small number of extreme cases, shutting off trade seems
    unlikely to be an effective method of pursuing a cleaner
    environment.

    Finally, there are arguments involving safety and security. Under
    the rules of the World Trade Organization, countries are allowed to
    set whatever standards for product safety they wish, but the
    standards must be the same for domestic products as for imported
    products and there must be a scientific basis for the standard. The
    national interest argument for protectionism holds that it is unwise
    to import certain key products because if the nation becomes
    dependent on key imported supplies, it could be vulnerable to a
    cutoff. However, it is often wiser to stockpile resources and to use
    foreign supplies when available, rather than preemptively
    restricting foreign supplies so as not to become dependent on them.

      

4.  <a href="#bookmark1697" class="a">How Governments Enact Trade Policy: Globally, Regionally, and</a>
    [Nationally](#bookmark1697)

    Governments determine trade policy at many different levels:
    administrative agencies within government, laws passed by the
    legislature, regional negotiations between a small group of nations
    (sometimes just two), and global negotiations through the World
    Trade Organization. During the second half of the twentieth century,
    trade barriers have, in general, declined quite substantially in the
    United States economy and in the global economy. One reason why
    countries sign international trade agreements to commit themselves
    to free trade is to give themselves protection against their own
    special interests. When an industry lobbies for protection from
    foreign producers, politicians can point out that, because of the
    trade treaty, their hands are tied.

      

5.  <a href="#bookmark1707" class="a">The Tradeoffs of Trade</a>
    [Policy](#bookmark1707)

    International trade certainly has income distribution effects. This
    is hardly surprising. All domestic or international competitive
    market forces are disruptive. They cause companies and industries to
    rise and fall. Government has a role to play in cushioning workers
    against the disruptions of the market. However, just as it would be
    unwise in the long term to clamp down on new technology and other
    causes of disruption in domestic markets, it would be unwise to
    clamp down on foreign trade. In both cases, the disruption brings
    with it economic benefits.

    24. Is international trade likely to have roughly the same effect on
        the number of jobs in each individual industry?

    25. How is international trade, taken as a whole, likely to affect
        the average level of wages?

    26. Is international trade likely to have about the same effect on
        everyone’s wages?

    27. What are main reasons for protecting “infant industries”? Why is
        it difficult to stop protecting them?

    28. What is dumping? Why does prohibiting it often work better in
        theory than in practice?

    29. What is the “race to the bottom” scenario?

    30. Do the rules of international trade require that all nations
        impose the same consumer safety standards?

    31. What is the national interest argument for protectionism with
        regard to certain products?

    32. Name several of the international treaties where countries
        negotiate with each other over trade policy.

    33. What is the general trend of trade barriers over recent decades:
        higher, lower, or about the same?

    34. If opening up to free trade would benefit a nation, then why do
        nations not just eliminate their trade barriers, and not bother
        with international trade negotiations?

    35. Who gains and who loses from trade?

    36. Why is trade a good thing if some people lose?

          

    37. What are some ways that governments can help people who lose
        from trade?

          

        CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS

          

    38. Show graphically that for any tariff, there is an equivalent
        quota that would give the same result. What would be the
        difference, then, between the two types of trade barriers?
        *Hint*: It is not something you can see from the graph.

    39. <a href="#bookmark1676" class="s34">From the</a>
        <a href="#bookmark1676" class="a">Work It Out</a> <span
        class="p">"Effects of Trade Barriers," you can see that a tariff
        raises the price of imports. What is interesting is that the
        price rises by less than the amount of the tariff. Who pays the
        rest of the tariff amount? Can you show this graphically?</span>

    40. If trade barriers hurt the average worker in an economy (due to
        lower wages), why does government create trade barriers?

    41. Why do you think labor standards and working conditions are
        lower in the low-income countries of the world than in countries
        like the United States?

    42. How would direct subsidies to key industries be preferable to
        tariffs or quotas?

    43. How can governments identify good candidates for infant industry
        protection? Can you suggest some key characteristics of good
        candidates? Why are industries like computers not good
        candidates for infant industry protection?

    44. Microeconomic theory argues that it is economically rationale
        (and profitable) to sell additional output as long as the price
        covers the variable costs of production. How is this relevant to
        the determination of whether dumping has occurred?

    45. How do you think Americans would feel if other countries began
        to urge the United States to increase environmental standards?

    46. Is it legitimate to impose higher safety standards on imported
        goods that exist in the foreign country where the goods were
        produced?

    47. Why might the unsafe consumer products argument be a more
        effective strategy (from the perspective of the importing
        country) than using tariffs or quotas to restrict imports?

    48. Why might a tax on domestic consumption of resources critical
        for national security be a more efficient approach than barriers
        to imports?

    49. Why do you think that the GATT rounds and, more recently, WTO
        negotiations have become longer and more difficult to resolve?

    50. An economic union requires giving up some political autonomy to
        succeed. What are some examples of political power countries
        must give up to be members of an economic union?

    51. What are some examples of innovative products that have
        disrupted their industries for the better?

    52. In principle, the benefits of international trade to a country
        exceed the costs, no matter whether the country is importing or
        exporting. In practice, it is not always possible to compensate
        the losers in a country, for example, workers who lose their
        jobs due to foreign imports. In your opinion, does that mean
        that trade should be inhibited to prevent the losses?

    53. Economists sometimes say that protectionism is the “second-best”
        choice for dealing with any particular problem. What they mean
        is that there is often a policy choice that is more direct or
        effective for dealing with the problem—a choice that would still
        allow the benefits of trade to occur. Explain why protectionism
        is a “second-best” choice for:

        1.  helping workers as a group

        2.  helping industries stay strong

        3.  protecting the environment

        4.  advancing national defense

    54. Trade has income distribution effects. For example, suppose that
        because of a government-negotiated reduction in trade barriers,
        trade between Germany and the Czech Republic increases. Germany
        sells house paint to the Czech Republic. The Czech Republic
        sells alarm clocks to Germany. Would you expect this pattern of
        trade to increase or decrease jobs and wages in the paint
        industry in Germany? The alarm clock industry in Germany? The
        paint industry in Czech Republic? The alarm clock industry in
        Czech Republic? What has to happen for there to be no increase
        in total unemployment in both countries?

                \(Q\) in each country without trade.

            2.  Now assume that free trade occurs. The free- trade price
                goes to 56.36 Baht. Who exports and imports cameras and
                in what quantities?

        ## in Principles of Economics

        <a href="#bookmark14" class="s34">(This appendix should be consulted after first reading</a>
        <a href="#bookmark14" class="a">Welcome to</a> Economics!<span
        class="p">) Economics is not math. There is no important concept
        in this course that cannot be explained without mathematics.
        That said, math is a tool that can be used to illustrate
        economic concepts. Remember the saying a picture is worth a
        thousand words? Instead of a picture, think of a graph. It is
        the same thing. Economists use models as the primary tool to
        derive insights about economic issues and problems. Math is one
        way of working with (or manipulating) economic models.</span>

        There are other ways of representing models, such as text or
        narrative. But why would you use your fist to bang a nail, if
        you had a hammer? Math has certain advantages over text. It
        disciplines your thinking by making you specify exactly what you
        mean. You can get away with fuzzy thinking in your head, but you
        cannot when you reduce a model to algebraic equations. At the
        same time, math also has disadvantages. Mathematical models are
        necessarily based on simplifying assumptions, so they are not
        likely to be perfectly realistic. Mathematical models also lack
        the nuances which can be found in narrative models. The point is
        that math is one tool, but it is not the only tool or even
        always the best tool economists can use. So what math will you
        need for this book? The answer is: little more than high school
        algebra and graphs. You will need to know:

        -   What a function is

        -   How to interpret the equation of a line (i.e., slope and
            intercept)

        -   How to manipulate a line (i.e., changing the slope or the
            intercept)

        -   How to compute and interpret a growth rate (i.e., percentage
            change)

        -   How to read and manipulate a graph

In this text, we will use the easiest math possible, and we will
introduce it in this appendix. So if you find some math in the book that
you cannot follow, come back to this appendix to review. Like most
things, math has diminishing returns. A little math ability goes a long
way; the more advanced math you bring in, the less additional knowledge
that will get you. That said, if you are going to major in economics,
you should consider learning a little calculus. It will be worth your
while in terms of helping you learn advanced economics more quickly.

#### <span id="bookmark1745">Algebraic Models</span>

<span id="bookmark1751">Often economic models (or parts of models) are
expressed in terms of mathematical functions. What is a function? A
function describes a relationship. Sometimes the relationship is a
definition. For example (using words), your professor is Adam Smith.
This could be expressed as Professor = Adam Smith. Or Friends = Bob +
Shawn + Margaret.</span>

Often in economics, functions describe cause and effect. The variable on
the left-hand side is what is being explained (“the effect”). On the
right-hand side is what is doing the explaining (“the causes”). For
example, suppose your GPA was determined as follows:

GPA = 0.25 × combined\_SAT + 0.25 × class\_attendance + 0.50 ×
hours\_spent\_studying

This equation states that your GPA depends on three things: your
combined SAT score, your class attendance, and the number of hours you
spend studying. It also says that study time is twice as important
(0.50) as either combined\_SAT score (0.25) or class\_attendance (0.25).
If this relationship is true, how could you raise your GPA? By not
skipping class and studying more. Note that you cannot do anything about
your SAT score, since if you are in college, you have (presumably)
already taken the SATs.

Of course, economic models express relationships using economic
variables, like Budget = money\_spent\_on\_econ\_books +
money\_spent\_on\_music, assuming that the only things you buy are
economics books and music.

Most of the relationships we use in this course are expressed as linear
equations of the form:

  

  

Expressing Equations Graphically

  

y = b + mx

Graphs are useful for two purposes. The first is to express equations
visually, and the second is to display statistics or data. This section
will discuss expressing equations visually.

<span id="bookmark1752">To a mathematician or an economist, a variable
is the name given to a quantity that may assume a range of values. In
the equation of a line presented above, x and y are the variables, with

Table A1 Values for the Slope Intercept Equation

  

<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_436.jpg" width="286" height="224" alt="image" />

  

<span id="bookmark1754"><span class="s36">Figure A1 Slope and the
Algebra of Straight Lines </span></span>This line graph has *x* on the
horizontal axis and y on the vertical axis. The y-intercept—that is, the
point where the line intersects the y-axis—is 9. The slope of the line
is 3; that is, there is a rise of 3 on the vertical axis for every
increase of 1 on the horizontal axis. The slope is the same all along a
straight line.

  

This example illustrates how the b and m terms in an equation for a
straight line determine the shape of the line. The

  

<span id="bookmark1755">b term is called the y-intercept. The reason for
this name is that, if x = 0, then the b term will reveal where the line
intercepts, or crosses, the y-axis. In this example, the line hits the
vertical axis at 9. The m term in the equation for the line is the
slope. Remember that slope is defined as rise over run; more
specifically, the slope of a line from one point to another is the
change in the vertical axis divided by the change in the horizontal
axis. In this example, each time the x term increases by one (the run),
the y term rises by three. Thus, the slope of this line is three.
Specifying a y-intercept and a slope—that is, specifying b and m in the
equation for a line—will identify a specific line. Although it is rare
for real-world data points to arrange themselves as an exact straight
line, it often turns out that a straight line can offer a reasonable
approximation of actual data.</span>

Interpreting the Slope

<a href="#bookmark1762" id="bookmark1756" class="s34">The concept of slope is very useful in economics, because it measures the relationship between two variables. A positive slope means that two variables are positively related; that is, when x increases, so does y, or when x decreases, y decreases also. Graphically, a positive slope means that as a line on the line graph moves from left to right, the line rises. The length-weight relationship, shown in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1762" class="a">Figure A3</a> <span class="p">later in
this Appendix, has a positive slope. We will learn in other chapters
that price and quantity supplied have a positive relationship; that is,
firms will supply more when the price is higher.</span>

<a href="#bookmark1764" id="bookmark1757" class="s34">A negative slope means that two variables are negatively related; that is, when x increases, y decreases, or when x decreases, y increases. Graphically, a negative slope means that, as the line on the line graph moves from left to right, the line falls. The altitude-air density relationship, shown in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1764" class="a">Figure A4</a> <span class="p">later in
this appendix, has a negative slope. We will learn that price and
quantity demanded have a negative relationship; that is, consumers will
purchase less when the price is higher.</span>

<a href="#bookmark1767" class="s34">A slope of zero means that there is no relationship between x and y. Graphically, the line is flat; that is, zero rise over the run.</a>
<a href="#bookmark1767" class="a">Figure A5</a> <span class="p">of the
unemployment rate, shown later in this appendix, illustrates a common
pattern of many line graphs: some segments where the slope is positive,
other segments where the slope is negative, and still other segments
where the slope is close to zero.</span>

The slope of a straight line between two points can be calculated in
numerical terms. To calculate slope, begin by designating one point as
the “starting point” and the other point as the “end point” and then
calculating the rise over run between these two points. As an example,
consider the slope of the air density graph between the points
representing an altitude of 4,000 meters and an altitude of 6,000
meters:

Rise: Change in variable on vertical axis (end point minus original
point)

= 0.100 – 0.307

= –0.207

Run: Change in variable on horizontal axis (end point minus original
point)

= 6,000 – 4,000

= 2,000

Thus, the slope of a straight line between these two points would be
that from the altitude of 4,000 meters up to 6,000 meters, the density
of the air decreases by approximately 0.1 kilograms/cubic meter for each
of the next 1,000 meters.

Suppose the slope of a line were to increase. Graphically, that means it
would get steeper. Suppose the slope of a line were to decrease. Then it
would get flatter. These conditions are true whether or not the slope
was positive or negative to begin with. A higher positive slope means a
steeper upward tilt to the line, while a smaller positive slope means a
flatter upward tilt to the line. A negative slope that is larger in
absolute value (that is, more negative) means a steeper downward tilt to
the line. A slope of zero is a horizontal flat line. A vertical line has
an infinite slope.

Suppose a line has a larger intercept. Graphically, that means it would
shift out (or up) from the old origin, parallel to the old line. If a
line has a smaller intercept, it would shift in (or down), parallel to
the old line.

Solving Models with Algebra

Economists often use models to answer a specific question, like: What
will the unemployment rate be if the economy grows at 3% per year?
Answering specific questions requires solving the “system” of equations
that represent the model.

Suppose the demand for personal pizzas is given by the following
equation:

  

  

Qd = 16 – 2P

where Qd is the amount of personal pizzas consumers want to buy (i.e.,
quantity demanded), and P is the price of pizzas. Suppose the supply of
personal pizzas is:

Qs = 2 + 5P

where Qs is the amount of pizza producers will supply (i.e., quantity
supplied).

Finally, suppose that the personal pizza market operates where supply
equals demand, or

Qd = Qs

We now have a system of three equations and three unknowns (Qd, Qs, and
P), which we can solve with algebra: Since Qd = Qs, we can set the
demand and supply equation equal to each other:

Qd = Qs

16 – 2P = 2 + 5P

Subtracting 2 from both sides and adding 2P to both sides yields:

16 – 2P – 2 = 2 + 5P – 2

14 – 2P = 5P

14 – 2P + 2P = 5P + 2P

14 = 7P

=

14<span class="s16"> </span>7P

7 7

2 = P

In other words, the price of each personal pizza will be $2. How much
will consumers buy? Taking the price of $2, and plugging it into the
demand equation, we get:

Qd = 16 – 2P

= 16 – 2(2)

= 16 – 4

= 12

So if the price is $2 each, consumers will purchase 12. How much will
producers supply? Taking the price of $2, and plugging it into the
supply equation, we get:

Qs = 2 + 5P

= 2 + 5(2)

= 2 + 10

= 12

So if the price is $2 each, producers will supply 12 personal pizzas.
This means we did our math correctly, since Qd

= Qs.

Solving Models with Graphs

<a href="#bookmark1758" class="s34">If algebra is not your forte, you can get the same answer by using graphs. Take the equations for Qd and Qs and graph them on the same set of axes as shown in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1758" class="a">Figure</a> A2<span class="p">. Since P
is on the vertical axis, it is easiest if you solve each equation for P.
The demand curve is then P = 8 – 0.5Qd and the supply curve is P = –0.4
+ 0.2Qs. Note that the vertical intercepts are 8 and –0.4, and the
slopes are –0.5 for demand and 0.2 for supply. If you draw the graphs
carefully, you will see that where they cross (Qs = Qd), the price is $2
and the quantity is 12, just like the algebra predicted.</span>

We will use graphs more frequently in this book than algebra, but now
you know the math behind the graphs.

#### <span id="bookmark1746">Growth Rates</span>

<span id="bookmark1759">Growth rates are frequently encountered in real
world economics. A growth rate is simply the percentage change in some
quantity. It could be your income. It could be a business’s sales. It
could be a nation’s GDP. The formula for computing a growth rate is
straightforward:</span>

Quantity

Percentage change = <u>Change in quantity</u>

Suppose your job pays $10 per hour. Your boss, however, is so impressed
with your work that he gives you a $2 per hour raise. The percentage
change (or growth rate) in your pay is $2/$10 = 0.20 or 20%.

To compute the growth rate for data over an extended period of time, for
example, the average annual growth in GDP over a decade or more, the
denominator is commonly defined a little differently. In the previous
example, we defined the quantity as the initial quantity—or the quantity
when we started. This is fine for a one-time calculation, but when we
compute the growth over and over, it makes more sense to define the
quantity as the average quantity over the period in question, which is
defined as the quantity halfway between the initial quantity and the
next quantity. This is harder to explain in words than to show with an
example. Suppose a nation’s GDP was $1 trillion in 2005 and $1.03
trillion in 2006. The growth rate between 2005 and 2006 would be the
change in GDP ($1.03 trillion – $1.00 trillion) divided by the average
GDP between 2005 and 2006 ($1.03 trillion + $1.00 trillion)/2. In other
words:

=

    $1.03 trillion – $1.00 trillion    <span class="s16"> ($1.03
trillion + $1.00 trillion) / 2</span>

=

0.03<span class="s16"> 1.015</span>

= 0.0296

= 2.96% growth

Note that if we used the first method, the calculation would be ($1.03
trillion – $1.00 trillion) / $1.00 trillion

= 3% growth, which is approximately the same as the second, more
complicated method. If you need a rough approximation, use the first
method. If you need accuracy, use the second method.

A few things to remember: A positive growth rate means the quantity is
growing. A smaller growth rate means the quantity is growing more
slowly. A larger growth rate means the quantity is growing more quickly.
A negative growth rate means the quantity is decreasing.

The same change over times yields a smaller growth rate. If you got a $2
raise each year, in the first year the growth rate would be $2/$10 =
20%, as shown above. But in the second year, the growth rate would be
$2/$12 = 0.167 or 16.7% growth. In the third year, the same $2 raise
would correspond to a $2/$14 = 14.2%. The moral of the story is this: To
keep the growth rate the same, the change must increase each period.

#### <span id="bookmark1747">Displaying Data Graphically and Interpreting the Graph</span>

Graphs are also used to display data or evidence. Graphs are a method of
presenting numerical patterns. They

  

  

condense detailed numerical information into a visual form in which
relationships and numerical patterns can be seen more easily. For
example, which countries have larger or smaller populations? A careful
reader could examine a long list of numbers representing the populations
of many countries, but with over 200 nations in the world, searching
through such a list would take concentration and time. Putting these
same numbers on a graph can quickly reveal population patterns.
Economists use graphs both for a compact and readable presentation of
groups of numbers and for building an intuitive grasp of relationships
and connections.

Three types of graphs are used in this book: line graphs, pie graphs,
and bar graphs. Each is discussed below. We also provide warnings about
how graphs can be manipulated to alter viewers’ perceptions of the
relationships in the data.

Line Graphs

<span id="bookmark1760">The graphs we have discussed so far are called
line graphs, because they show a relationship between two variables: one
measured on the horizontal axis and the other measured on the vertical
axis.</span>

<a href="#bookmark1763" id="bookmark1761" class="s34">Sometimes it is useful to show more than one set of data on the same axes. The data in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1763" class="a">Table A2</a>
<a href="#bookmark1762" class="s34">is displayed in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1762" class="a">Figure A3</a> <span class="p">which
shows the relationship between two variables: length and median weight
for American baby boys and girls during the first three years of life.
(The median means that half of all babies weigh more than this and half
weigh less.) The line graph measures length in inches on the horizontal
axis and weight in pounds on the vertical axis. For example, point A on
the figure shows that a boy who is 28 inches long will have a median
weight of about 19 pounds. One line on the graph shows the length-weight
relationship for boys and the other line shows the relationship for
girls. This kind of graph is widely used by healthcare providers to
check whether a child’s physical development is roughly on track.</span>

<span id="bookmark1762">Figure A3 The Length-Weight Relationship for
American Boys and Girls</span> <span class="s37">The line graph shows
the relationship between height and weight for boys and girls from birth
to 3 years. Point A, for example, shows that a boy of 28 inches in
height (measured on the horizontal axis) is typically 19 pounds in
weight (measured on the vertical axis). These data apply only to
children in the first three years of life.</span>

Table A2 Length to Weight Relationship for American Boys and Girls

  

<a href="#bookmark1764" class="s34">Not all relationships in economics are linear. Sometimes they are curves.</a>
<a href="#bookmark1764" class="a">Figure A4</a>
<a href="#bookmark1765" class="s34">presents another example of a line graph, representing the data from</a>
<a href="#bookmark1765" class="a">Table</a>
A3<a href="#bookmark1764" class="s34">. In this case, the line graph shows how thin the air becomes when you climb a mountain. The horizontal axis of the figure shows altitude, measured in meters above sea level. The vertical axis measures the density of the air at each altitude. Air density is measured by the weight of the air in a cubic meter of space (that is, a box measuring one meter in height, width, and depth). As the graph shows, air pressure is heaviest at ground level and becomes lighter as you climb.</a>
<a href="#bookmark1764" class="a">Figure A4</a> <span class="p">shows
that a cubic meter of air at an altitude of 500 meters weighs
approximately one kilogram (about 2.2 pounds). However, as the altitude
increases, air density decreases. A cubic meter of air at the top of
Mount Everest, at about 8,828 meters, would weigh only 0.023 kilograms.
The thin air at high altitudes explains why many mountain climbers need
to use oxygen tanks as they reach the top of a mountain.</span>

Table A3 Altitude to Air Density Relationship

  

The length-weight relationship and the altitude-air density
relationships in these two figures represent averages. If you were to
collect actual data on air pressure at different altitudes, the same
altitude in different geographic locations will have slightly different
air density, depending on factors like how far you are from the equator,
local weather conditions, and the humidity in the air. Similarly, in
measuring the height and weight of children for the previous line graph,
children of a particular height would have a range of different weights,
some above average and some below. In the real world, this sort of
variation in data is common. The task of a researcher is to organize
that data in a way that helps to understand typical patterns. The study
of statistics, especially when combined with computer statistics and
spreadsheet programs, is a great help in organizing this kind of data,
plotting line graphs, and looking for typical underlying relationships.
For most economics and social science majors, a statistics course will
be required at some point.

<a href="#bookmark1767" id="bookmark1766" class="s34">One common line graph is called a time series, in which the horizontal axis shows time and the vertical axis displays another variable. Thus, a time series graph shows how a variable changes over time.</a>
<a href="#bookmark1767" class="a">Figure</a> A5 <span class="p">shows
the unemployment rate in the United States since 1975, where
unemployment is defined as the percentage of adults who want jobs and
are looking for a job, but cannot find one. The points for the
unemployment rate in each year are plotted</span>

  

  

on the graph, and a line then connects the points, showing how the
unemployment rate has moved up and down since 1975. The line graph makes
it easy to see, for example, that the highest unemployment rate during
this time period was slightly less than 10% in the early 1980s and 2010,
while the unemployment rate declined from the early 1990s to the end of
the 1990s, before rising and then falling back in the early 2000s, and
then rising sharply during the recession from 2008–2009.

used to show how an overall total is divided into parts. A circle

shows the actual number of people in each age category, while the number
in parentheses shows the percentage of the total population comprised by
that age group.</span>

bar graphs, comparing the shaded areas, rather than trying to compare
several pie graphs.</span>

Comparing Line Graphs with Pie Charts and Bar Graphs

Now that you are familiar with pie graphs, bar graphs, and line graphs,
how do you know which graph to use for your data? Pie graphs are often
better than line graphs at showing how an overall group is divided.
However, if a pie graph has too many slices, it can become difficult to
interpret.

<a href="#bookmark1772" class="s34">Bar graphs are especially useful when comparing quantities. For example, if you are studying the populations of different countries, as in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1772" class="a">Figure</a> A7<span class="p">, bar
graphs can show the relationships between the population sizes of
multiple countries. Not only can it show these relationships, but it can
also show breakdowns of different groups within the population.</span>

A line graph is often the most effective format for illustrating a
relationship between two variables that are both changing. For example,
time series graphs can show patterns as time changes, like the
unemployment rate over time.

  

  

Line graphs are widely used in economics to present continuous data
about prices, wages, quantities bought and sold, the size of the
economy.

How Graphs Can Be Misleading

<a href="#bookmark1775" class="s34">Graphs not only reveal patterns; they can also alter how patterns are perceived. To see some of the ways this can be done, consider the line graphs of</a>
<a href="#bookmark1775" class="a">Figure</a>
A9<a href="#bookmark1776" class="s34">,</a>
<a href="#bookmark1776" class="a">Figure</a>
A10<a href="#bookmark1777" class="s34">, and</a>
<a href="#bookmark1777" class="a">Figure</a> A11<span class="p">. These
graphs all illustrate the unemployment rate—but from different
perspectives.</span>

<span id="bookmark1777">Figure A11 Presenting Unemployment Rates in
Different Ways, All of Them Accurate</span> <span class="s37">Simply
changing the width and height of the area in which data is displayed can
alter the perception of the data.</span>

  

<a href="#bookmark1775" class="s34">Suppose you wanted a graph which gives the impression that the rise in unemployment in 2009 was not all that large, or all that extraordinary by historical standards. You might choose to present your data as in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1775" class="a">Figure A9</a>
<a href="#bookmark1775" class="s34">(a).</a>
<a href="#bookmark1775" class="a">Figure A9</a>
<a href="#bookmark1767" class="s34">(a) includes much of the same data presented earlier in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1767" class="a">Figure</a>
A5<a href="#bookmark1775" class="s34">, but stretches the horizontal axis out longer relative to the vertical axis. By spreading the graph wide and flat, the visual appearance is that the rise in unemployment is not so large, and is similar to some past rises in unemployment. Now imagine you wanted to emphasize how unemployment spiked substantially higher in 2009. In this case, using the same data, you can stretch the vertical axis out relative to the horizontal axis, as in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1775" class="a">Figure A9</a> <span class="p">(b),
which makes all rises and falls in unemployment appear larger.</span>

<a href="#bookmark1776" class="s34">A similar effect can be accomplished without changing the length of the axes, but by changing the scale on the vertical axis. In</a>
<a href="#bookmark1776" class="a">Figure A10</a>
<a href="#bookmark1776" class="s34">(c), the scale on the vertical axis runs from 0% to 30%, while in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1776" class="a">Figure A10</a>
<a href="#bookmark1767" class="s34">(d), the vertical axis runs from 3% to 10%. Compared to</a>
Figure
A5<a href="#bookmark1776" class="s34">, where the vertical scale runs from 0% to 12%,</a>
<a href="#bookmark1776" class="a">Figure A10</a>
<a href="#bookmark1776" class="s34">(c) makes the fluctuation in unemployment look smaller, while</a>
<a href="#bookmark1776" class="a">Figure A10</a> <span class="p">(d)
makes it look larger.</span>

<a href="#bookmark1776" class="s34">Another way to alter the perception of the graph is to reduce the amount of variation by changing the number of points plotted on the graph.</a>
<a href="#bookmark1776" class="a">Figure A10</a>
<a href="#bookmark1777" class="s34">(e) shows the unemployment rate according to five-year averages. By averaging out some of the year-to-year changes, the line appears smoother and with fewer highs and lows. In reality, the unemployment rate is reported monthly, and</a>
<a href="#bookmark1777" class="a">Figure A11</a>
<a href="#bookmark1777" class="s34">(f) shows the monthly figures since 1960, which fluctuate more than the five-year average.</a>
<a href="#bookmark1777" class="a">Figure A11</a> <span class="p">(f) is
also a vivid illustration of how graphs can compress lots of data. The
graph includes monthly data since 1960, which over almost 50 years,
works out to nearly 600 data points.</span>

  

  

Reading that list of 600 data points in numerical form would be
hypnotic. You can, however, get a good intuitive sense of these 600 data
points very quickly from the graph.

<a href="#bookmark1777" class="s34">A final trick in manipulating the perception of graphical information is that, by choosing the starting and ending points carefully, you can influence the perception of whether the variable is rising or falling. The original data show a general pattern with unemployment low in the 1960s, but spiking up in the mid-1970s, early 1980s, early 1990s, early 2000s, and late 2000s.</a>
<a href="#bookmark1777" class="a">Figure A11</a> <span class="p">(g),
however, shows a graph that goes back only to 1975, which gives an
impression that unemployment was more-or-less gradually falling over
time until the 2009 recession pushed it back up to its “original”
level—which is a plausible interpretation if one starts at the high
point around 1975.</span>

These kinds of tricks—or shall we just call them “presentation choices”—
are not limited to line graphs. In a pie chart with many small slices
and one large slice, someone must decided what categories should be used
to produce these slices in the first place, thus making some slices
appear bigger than others. If you are making a bar graph, you can make
the vertical axis either taller or shorter, which will tend to make
variations in the height of the bars appear more or less.

Being able to read graphs is an essential skill, both in economics and
in life. A graph is just one perspective or point of view, shaped by
choices such as those discussed in this section. Do not always believe
the first quick impression from a graph. View with caution.

#### <span id="bookmark1748">Key Concepts and Summary</span>

Math is a tool for understanding economics and economic relationships
can be expressed mathematically using algebra or graphs. The algebraic
equation for a line is y = b + mx, where x is the variable on the
horizontal axis and y is the variable on the vertical axis, the b term
is the y-intercept and the m term is the slope. The slope of a line is
the same at any point on the line and it indicates the relationship
(positive, negative, or zero) between two economic variables.

Economic models can be solved algebraically or graphically. Graphs allow
you to illustrate data visually. They can illustrate patterns,
comparisons, trends, and apportionment by condensing the numerical data
and providing an intuitive sense of relationships in the data. A line
graph shows the relationship between two variables: one is shown on the
horizontal axis and one on the vertical axis. A pie graph shows how
something is allotted, such as a sum of money or a group of people. The
size of each slice of the pie is drawn to represent the corresponding
percentage of the whole. A bar graph uses the height of bars to show a
relationship, where each bar represents a certain entity, like a country
or a group of people. The bars on a bar graph can also be divided into
segments to show subgroups.

Any graph is a single visual perspective on a subject. The impression it
leaves will be based on many choices, such as what data or time frame is
included, how data or groups are divided up, the relative size of
vertical and horizontal axes, whether the scale used on a vertical
starts at zero. Thus, any graph should be regarded somewhat skeptically,
remembering that the underlying relationship can be open to different
interpretations.

<a href="#bookmark952" class="s34">and</a>

class="p">.) The fundamental ideas of Keynesian economics were developed
before the AD/AS model was popularized. From the 1930s until the 1970s,
Keynesian economics was usually explained with a different model, known
as the expenditure-output approach. This approach is strongly rooted in
the fundamental assumptions of Keynesian economics: it focuses on the
total amount of spending in the economy, with no explicit mention of
aggregate supply or of the price level (although as you will see, it is
possible to draw some inferences about aggregate supply and price levels
based on the diagram).</span>

#### <span id="bookmark1779">The Axes of the Expenditure-Output Diagram</span>

<a href="#bookmark1790" id="bookmark1789" class="s34">The expenditure-output model, sometimes also called the Keynesian cross diagram, determines the equilibrium level of real GDP by the point where the total or aggregate expenditures in the economy are equal to the amount of output produced.

<span id="bookmark1790">Figure B1 The Expenditure-Output Diagram</span>
<span class="s37">The aggregate expenditure-output model shows aggregate
expenditures on the vertical axis and real GDP on the horizontal axis. A
vertical line shows potential GDP where full employment occurs. The
45-degree line shows all points where aggregate expenditures and output
are equal. The aggregate expenditure schedule shows how total spending
or aggregate expenditure increases as output or real GDP rises. The
intersection of the aggregate expenditure schedule and the 45-degree
line will be the equilibrium.</span>

Equilibrium occurs at E<span class="s63">0</span>, where aggregate
expenditure AE<span class="s63">0</span> is equal to the output level
Y<span class="s63">0</span>.

  

<span id="bookmark1791">Remember that GDP can be thought of in several
equivalent ways: it measures both the value of spending on final goods
and also the value of the production of final goods. All sales of the
final goods and services that make up GDP will eventually end up as
income for workers, for managers, and for investors and owners of firms.
The sum of all the income received for contributing resources to GDP is
called national income (Y). At some points in the discussion that
follows, it will be useful to refer to real GDP as “national income.”
Both axes are measured in real (inflation- adjusted) terms.</span>

The Potential GDP Line and the 45-degree Line

  

  

<span id="bookmark1792">The Keynesian cross diagram contains two lines
that serve as conceptual guideposts to orient the discussion. The first
is a vertical line showing the level of potential GDP. Potential GDP
means the same thing here that it means in the AD/AS diagrams: it refers
to the quantity of output that the economy can produce with full
employment of its labor and physical capital.</span>

The second conceptual line on the Keynesian cross diagram is the
45-degree line, which starts at the origin and reaches up and to the
right. A line that stretches up at a 45-degree angle represents the set
of points (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3) and so on, where the measurement on the
vertical axis is equal to the measurement on the horizontal axis. In
this diagram, the 45-degree line shows the set of points where the level
of aggregate expenditure in the economy, measured on the vertical axis,
is equal to the level of output or national income in the economy,
measured by GDP on the horizontal axis.

<span id="bookmark1793">When the macroeconomy is in equilibrium, it must
be true that the aggregate expenditures in the economy are equal to the
real GDP—because by definition, GDP is the measure of what is spent on
final sales of goods and services in the economy. Thus, the equilibrium
calculated with a Keynesian cross diagram will always end up where
aggregate expenditure and output are equal—which will only occur along
the 45-degree line.</span>

The Aggregate Expenditure Schedule

<span id="bookmark1794">The final ingredient of the Keynesian cross or
expenditure-output diagram is the aggregate expenditure schedule, which
will show the total expenditures in the economy for each level of real
GDP. The intersection of the aggregate expenditure line with the
45-degree line—at point E</span><span class="s60">0</span>
<a href="#bookmark1790" class="s34">in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1790" class="a">Figure</a> <span
class="s54">B1</span>—will show the equilibrium for the economy, because
it is the point where aggregate expenditure is equal to output or real
GDP. After developing an understanding of what the aggregate
expenditures schedule means, we will return to this equilibrium and how
to interpret it.

#### <span id="bookmark1780">Building the Aggregate Expenditure Schedule</span>

Aggregate expenditure is the key to the expenditure-income model. The
aggregate expenditure schedule shows, either in the form of a table or a
graph, how aggregate expenditures in the economy rise as real GDP or
national income rises. Thus, in thinking about the components of the
aggregate expenditure line—consumption, investment, government spending,
exports and imports—the key question is how expenditures in each
category will adjust as national income rises.

Consumption as a Function of National Income

<span id="bookmark1795">How do consumption expenditures increase as
national income rises? People can do two things with their income:
consume it or save it (for the moment, let’s ignore the need to pay
taxes with some of it). Each person who receives an additional dollar
faces this choice. The marginal propensity to consume (MPC), is the
share of the additional dollar of income a person decides to devote to
consumption expenditures. The marginal propensity to save (MPS) is the
share of the additional dollar a person decides to save. It must always
hold true that:</span><span id="bookmark1796">‌</span>

MPC + MPS = 1

For example, if the marginal propensity to consume out of the marginal
amount of income earned is 0.9, then the marginal propensity to save is
0.1.

<a href="#bookmark1798" class="s34">With this relationship in mind, consider the relationship among income, consumption, and savings shown in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1798" class="a">Figure</a> B2<span class="p">. (Note
that we use “Aggregate Expenditure” on the vertical axis in this and the
following figures, because all consumption expenditures are parts of
aggregate expenditures.)</span>

An assumption commonly made in this model is that even if income were
zero, people would have to consume something. In this example,
consumption would be $600 even if income were zero. Then, the MPC is 0.8
and the MPS is 0.2. Thus, when income increases by $1,000, consumption
rises by $800 and savings rises by $200. At an income of

<a href="#bookmark1798" id="bookmark1797" class="s34">$4,000, total consumption will be the $600 that would be consumed even without any income, plus $4,000 multiplied by the marginal propensity to consume of 0.8, or $ 3,200, for a total of $ 3,800. The total amount of consumption and saving must always add up to the total amount of income. (Exactly how a situation of zero income and negative savings would work in practice is not important, because even low-income societies are not literally at zero income, so the point is hypothetical.) This relationship between income and consumption, illustrated in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1798" class="a">Figure B2</a>
<a href="#bookmark1799" class="s34">and</a>
<a href="#bookmark1799" class="a">Table B</a>1<span class="p">, is
called the consumption function.</span>

  

<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_448.jpg" width="301" height="237" alt="image" />

<span id="bookmark1798">Figure B2 The Consumption Function</span> <span
class="s37">In the expenditure-output model, how does consumption
increase with the level of national income? Output on the horizontal
axis is conceptually the same as national income, since the value of all
final output that is produced and sold must be income to someone,
somewhere in the economy. At a national income level of zero, $600 is
consumed. Then, each time income rises by $1,000, consumption rises by
$800, because in this example, the marginal propensity to consume is
0.8.</span>

  

<a href="#bookmark1799" class="s34">The pattern of consumption shown in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1799" class="a">Table B1</a>
<a href="#bookmark1798" class="s34">is plotted in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1798" class="a">Figure</a> B2<span class="p">. To
calculate consumption, multiply the income level by 0.8, for the
marginal propensity to consume, and add $600, for the amount that would
be consumed even if income was zero. Consumption plus savings must be
equal to income.</span>

Table B1 The Consumption Function

  

<a href="#bookmark1799" class="s34">However, a number of factors other than income can also cause the entire consumption function to shift. These factors were summarized in the earlier discussion of consumption, and listed in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1799" class="a">Table</a> B1<span class="p">. When the
consumption function moves, it can shift in two ways: either the entire
consumption function can move up or down in a parallel manner, or the
slope of the consumption function can shift so that it becomes steeper
or flatter. For example, if a tax cut leads consumers to spend more, but
does not affect their marginal propensity to consume, it would cause an
upward shift to a new consumption function that is parallel to the
original one. However, a change in household preferences for saving that
reduced the marginal propensity to save would cause the slope of the
consumption function to become steeper: that is, if the savings rate is
lower, then every increase in income leads to a larger rise in
consumption.</span>

  

  

Investment as a Function of National Income

<span id="bookmark1800">Investment decisions are forward-looking, based
on expected rates of return. Precisely because investment decisions
depend primarily on perceptions about future economic conditions, they
do</span> *not*
<a href="#bookmark1801" class="s34">depend primarily on the level of GDP in the current year. Thus, on a Keynesian cross diagram, the investment function can be drawn as a horizontal line, at a fixed level of expenditure.</a>
<a href="#bookmark1801" class="a">Figure B3</a><span class="s54">
</span>shows an investment function where the level of investment is,
for the sake of concreteness, set at the specific level of 500. Just as
a consumption function shows the relationship between consumption levels
and real GDP (or national income), the investment function shows the
relationship between investment levels and real GDP.

  

  

<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_449.jpg" width="339" height="230" alt="image" />

<span id="bookmark1801">Figure B3 The Investment Function</span> <span
class="s37">The investment function is drawn as a flat line because
investment is based on interest rates and expectations about the future,
and so it does not change with the level of current national income. In
this example, investment expenditures are at a level of 500. However,
changes in factors like technological opportunities, expectations about
near-term economic growth, and interest rates would all cause the
investment function to shift up or down.</span>

  

The appearance of the investment function as a horizontal line does not
mean that the level of investment never moves. It means only that in the
context of this two-dimensional diagram, the level of investment on the
vertical aggregate expenditure axis does not vary according to the
current level of real GDP on the horizontal axis. However, all the other
factors that vary investment—new technological opportunities,
expectations about near-term economic growth, interest rates, the price
of key inputs, and tax incentives for investment—can cause the
horizontal investment function to shift up or down.

Government Spending and Taxes as a Function of National Income

<a href="#bookmark1802" class="s34">In the Keynesian cross diagram, government spending appears as a horizontal line, as in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1802" class="a">Figure</a> B4<span class="p">, where
government spending is set at a level of 1,300. As in the case of
investment spending, this horizontal line does not mean that government
spending is unchanging. It means only that government spending changes
when Congress decides on a change in the budget, rather than shifting in
a predictable way with the current size of the real GDP shown on the
horizontal axis.</span>

  

<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_450.jpg" width="339" height="235" alt="image" />

<span id="bookmark1802">Figure B4 The Government Spending
Function</span> <span class="s37">The level of government spending is
determined by political factors, not by the level of real GDP in a given
year. Thus, government spending is drawn as a horizontal line. In this
example, government spending is at a level of 1,300. Congressional
decisions to increase government spending will cause this horizontal
line to shift up, while decisions to reduce spending would cause it to
shift down.</span>

  

The situation of taxes is different because taxes often rise or fall
with the volume of economic activity. For example, income taxes are
based on the level of income earned and sales taxes are based on the
amount of sales made, and both income and sales tend to be higher when
the economy is growing and lower when the economy is in a recession. For
the purposes of constructing the basic Keynesian cross diagram, it is
helpful to view taxes as a proportionate share of GDP. In the United
States, for example, taking federal, state, and local taxes together,
government typically collects about 30–35 % of income as taxes.

<a href="#bookmark1804" class="a">Table B2</a> <span class="p">revises
the earlier table on the consumption function so that it takes taxes
into account. The first column shows national income. The second column
calculates taxes, which in this example are set at a rate of 30%,
or</span>

<a href="#bookmark1803" class="s34">0.3. The third column shows after-tax income; that is, total income minus taxes. The fourth column then calculates consumption in the same manner as before: multiply after-tax income by 0.8, representing the marginal propensity to consume, and then add $600, for the amount that would be consumed even if income was zero. When taxes are included, the marginal propensity to consume is reduced by the amount of the tax rate, so each additional dollar of income results in a smaller increase in consumption than before taxes. For this reason, the consumption function, with taxes included, is flatter than the consumption function without taxes, as</a>
<a href="#bookmark1803" class="a">Figure B5</a> <span
class="p">shows.</span>

Table B2 The Consumption Function Before and After Taxes

  

Exports and Imports as a Function of National Income

<a href="#bookmark1805" class="s34">The export function, which shows how exports change with the level of a country’s own real GDP, is drawn as a horizontal line, as in the example in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1805" class="a">Figure B6</a> <span class="p">(a)
where exports are drawn at a level of $840. Again, as in the case of
investment spending and government spending, drawing the export function
as horizontal does not imply that exports never change. It just means
that they do not change because of what is on the horizontal axis—that
is, a country’s own level of domestic production—and instead are shaped
by the level of aggregate demand in other countries. More demand for
exports from other countries would cause the export function to shift
up; less demand for exports from other countries would cause it to shift
down.</span>

<span id="bookmark1805">Figure B6 The Export and Import Functions</span>
<span class="s37">(a) The export function is drawn as a horizontal line
because exports are determined by the buying power of other countries
and thus do not change with the size of the domestic economy. In this
example, exports are set at 840. However, exports can shift up or down,
depending on buying patterns in other countries. (b) The import function
is drawn in negative territory because expenditures on imported products
are a subtraction from expenditures in the domestic economy. In this
example, the marginal propensity to import is 0.1, so imports are
calculated by multiplying the level of income by –0.1.</span>

  

Imports are drawn in the Keynesian cross diagram as a downward-sloping
line, with the downward slope determined

<a href="#bookmark1805" id="bookmark1806" class="s34">by the marginal propensity to import (MPI), out of national income. In</a>
<a href="#bookmark1805" class="a">Figure B6</a> <span class="p">(b), the
marginal propensity to import is 0.1. Thus, if real GDP is $5,000,
imports are $500; if national income is $6,000, imports are $600, and so
on. The import function is drawn as downward sloping and negative,
because it represents a subtraction from the aggregate expenditures in
the domestic economy. A change in the marginal propensity to import,
perhaps as a result of changes in preferences, would alter the slope of
the import function.</span>

  

Using an Algebraic Approach to the Expenditure-Output Model

In the expenditure-output or Keynesian cross model, the equilibrium
occurs where the aggregate expenditure line (AE line) crosses the
45-degree line. Given algebraic equations for two lines, the point where
they cross can be readily calculated. Imagine an economy with the
following characteristics.

Y = Real GDP or national income T = Taxes = 0.3Y

C = Consumption = 140 + 0.9(Y – T) I = Investment = 400

G = Government spending = 800 X = Exports = 600

M = Imports = 0.15Y

Step 1. Determine the aggregate expenditure function. In this case, it
is:

AE = C + I + G + X – M

AE = 140 + 0.9(Y – T) + 400 + 800 + 600 – 0.15Y

Step 2. The equation for the 45-degree line is the set of points where
GDP or national income on the horizontal axis is equal to aggregate
expenditure on the vertical axis. Thus, the equation for the 45-degree
line is: AE = Y.

Step 3. The next step is to solve these two equations for Y (or AE,
since they will be equal to each other). Substitute Y for AE:

Y = 140 + 0.9(Y – T) + 400 + 800 + 600 – 0.15Y

Step 4. Insert the term 0.3Y for the tax rate T. This produces an
equation with only one variable, Y. Step 5. Work through the algebra and
solve for Y.

Y = 140 + 0.9(Y – 0.3Y) + 400 + 800 + 600 – 0.15Y Y = 140 + 0.9Y – 0.27Y
+ 1800 – 0.15Y

Y = 1940 + 0.48Y

=

Y – 0.48Y = 1940 0.52Y = 1940

0.52Y

0.52

1940

0.52

Y = 3730

This algebraic framework is flexible and useful in predicting how
economic events and policy actions will affect real GDP.

Step 6. Say, for example, that because of changes in the relative prices
of domestic and foreign goods, the marginal propensity to import falls
to 0.1. Calculate the equilibrium output when the marginal propensity to
import is changed to 0.1.

  

  

Y = 140 + 0.9(Y – 0.3Y) + 400 + 800 + 600 – 0.1Y Y = 1940 – 0.53Y

0.47Y = 1940

Y = 4127

Step 7. Because of a surge of business confidence, investment rises to
500. Calculate the equilibrium output.

Y = 140 + 0.9(Y – 0.3Y) + 500 + 800 + 600 – 0.15Y Y = 2040 + 0.48Y

Y – 0.48Y = 2040

0.52Y = 2040

Y = 3923

For issues of policy, the key questions would be how to adjust
government spending levels or tax rates so that the equilibrium level of
output is the full employment level. In this case, let the economic
parameters be:

Y = National income T = Taxes = 0.3Y

C = Consumption = 200 + 0.9(Y – T) I = Investment = 600

G = Government spending = 1,000 X = Exports = 600

Y = Imports = 0.1(Y – T)

Step 8. Calculate the equilibrium for this economy (remember Y = AE).

Y = 200 + 0.9(Y – 0.3Y) + 600 + 1000 + 600 – 0.1(Y – 0.3Y) Y – 0.63Y +
0.07Y = 2400

0.44Y = 2400

Y = 5454

Step 9. Assume that the full employment level of output is 6,000. What
level of government spending would be necessary to reach that level? To
answer this question, plug in 6,000 as equal to Y, but leave G as a
variable, and solve for G. Thus:

6000 = 200 + 0.9(6000 – 0.3(6000)) + 600 + G + 600 – 0.1(6000 –
0.3(6000))

Step 10. Solve this problem arithmetically. The answer is: G = 1,240. In
other words, increasing government spending by 240, from its original
level of 1,000, to 1,240, would raise output to the full employment
level of GDP.

Indeed, the question of how much to increase government spending so that
equilibrium output will rise from 5,454 to 6,000 can be answered without
working through the algebra, just by using the multiplier formula. The
multiplier equation in this case is:

     1      

1 – 0.56

= 2.27

Thus, to raise output by 546 would require an increase in government
spending of 546/2.27=240, which is the same as the answer derived from
the algebraic calculation.

This algebraic framework is highly flexible. For example, taxes can be
treated as a total set by political considerations (like government
spending) and not dependent on national income. Imports might be based
on before-tax income, not after-tax income. For certain purposes, it may
be helpful to analyze the economy without exports and imports. A more
complicated approach could divide up consumption, investment,
government, exports and imports into smaller categories, or to build in
some variability in the rates of taxes, savings, and imports. A wise
economist will shape the model

to fit the specific question under investigation.

  

Building the Combined Aggregate Expenditure Function

B2<a href="#bookmark1810" class="s34">, which showed how to bring taxes into the consumption function. The first column is real GDP or national income, which is what appears on the horizontal axis of the income-expenditure diagram. The second column calculates after-tax income, based on the assumption, in this case, that 30% of real GDP is collected in taxes. The third column is based on an MPC of 0.8, so that as after-tax income rises by $700 from one row to the next, consumption rises by $560 (700 × 0.8) from one row to the next. Investment, government spending, and exports do not change with the level of current national income. In the previous discussion, investment was $500, government spending was $1,300, and exports were $840, for a total of $2,640. This total is shown in the fourth column. Imports are 0.1 of real GDP in this example, and the level of imports is calculated in the fifth column. The final column, aggregate expenditures, sums up C + I + G + X – M.

expenditure schedule crosses the 45-degree line, at a real GDP of
$6,000. Potential GDP in this example is $7,000, so the equilibrium is
occurring at a level of output or real GDP below the potential GDP
level.</span>

Table B3 National Income-Aggregate Expenditure Equilibrium

  

<span id="bookmark1812">The aggregate expenditure function is formed by
stacking on top of each other the consumption function (after taxes),
the investment function, the government spending function, the export
function, and the import function. The point at which the aggregate
expenditure function intersects the vertical axis will be determined by
the levels of investment, government, and export expenditures—which do
not vary with national income. The upward slope of the aggregate
expenditure function will be determined by the marginal propensity to
save, the tax rate, and the marginal propensity to import. A higher
marginal propensity to save, a higher tax rate, and a higher marginal
propensity to import will all make the slope of the aggregate
expenditure function flatter—because out of any extra income, more is
going to savings or taxes or imports and less to spending on domestic
goods and services.</span>

The equilibrium occurs where national income is equal to aggregate
expenditure, which is shown on the graph as the point where the
aggregate expenditure schedule crosses the 45-degree line. In this
example, the equilibrium occurs at 6,000. This equilibrium can also be
read off the table under the figure; it is the level of national income
where aggregate expenditure is equal to national income.

#### <span id="bookmark1781">Equilibrium in the Keynesian Cross Model</span>

With the aggregate expenditure line in place, the next step is to relate
it to the two other elements of the Keynesian cross diagram. Thus, the
first subsection interprets the intersection of the aggregate
expenditure function and the 45-degree line, while the next subsection
relates this point of intersection to the potential GDP line.

Where Equilibrium Occurs

<a href="#bookmark1810" class="s34">The point where the aggregate expenditure line that is constructed from C + I + G + X – M crosses the 45-degree line will be the equilibrium for the economy. It is the only point on the aggregate expenditure line where the total amount being spent on aggregate demand equals the total level of production. In</a>
<a href="#bookmark1810" class="a">Figure</a> B7<span class="p">, this
point of equilibrium (E</span><span
class="s60">0</span><a href="#bookmark1811" class="s34">) happens at 6,000, which can also be read off</a>
<a href="#bookmark1811" class="a">Table</a> B3<span class="p">.</span>

<a href="#bookmark1814" id="bookmark1813" class="s34">The meaning of “equilibrium” remains the same; that is, equilibrium is a point of balance where no incentive exists to shift away from that outcome. To understand why the point of intersection between the aggregate expenditure function and the 45-degree line is a macroeconomic equilibrium, consider what would happen if an economy found itself to the right of the equilibrium point E, say point H in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1814" class="a">Figure</a> B8<span class="p">, where
output is higher than the equilibrium. At point H, the level of
aggregate expenditure is below the 45-degree line, so that the level of
aggregate expenditure in the economy is less than the level of output.
As a result, at point H, output is piling up unsold—not a sustainable
state of affairs.</span>

  

<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_456.jpg" width="301" height="243" alt="image" />

<span id="bookmark1814">Figure B8 Equilibrium in the Keynesian Cross
Diagram</span> <span class="s37">If output was above the equilibrium
level, at H, then the real output is greater than the aggregate
expenditure in the economy. This pattern cannot hold, because it would
mean that goods are produced but piling up unsold. If output was below
the equilibrium level at L, then aggregate expenditure would be greater
than output. This pattern cannot hold either, because it would mean that
spending exceeds the number of goods being produced. Only point E can be
at equilibrium, where output, or national income and aggregate
expenditure, are equal. The equilibrium (E) must lie on the 45-degree
line, which is the set of points where national income and aggregate
expenditure are equal.</span>

  

Conversely, consider the situation where the level of output is at point
L—where real output is lower than the equilibrium. In that case, the
level of aggregate demand in the economy is above the 45-degree line,
indicating that the level of aggregate expenditure in the economy is
greater than the level of output. When the level of aggregate demand has
emptied the store shelves, it cannot be sustained, either. Firms will
respond by increasing their level of production. Thus, the equilibrium
must be the point where the amount produced and the amount spent are in
balance, at the intersection of the aggregate expenditure function and
the 45-degree line.

  

Finding Equilibrium

<a href="#bookmark1815" class="a">Table B4</a>
<a href="#bookmark1815" class="s48">gives some information on an economy. The Keynesian model assumes that there is some level of consumption even without income. That amount is $236 – $216 = $20. $20 will be consumed when national income equals zero. Assume that taxes are 0.2 of real GDP. Let the marginal propensity to save of after-tax income be 0.1. The level of investment is $70, the level of government spending is $80, and the level of exports is $50. Imports are 0.2 of after-tax income. Given these values, you need to complete</a>
<a href="#bookmark1815" class="a">Table</a> B4 <span class="s47">and
then answer these questions:</span>

-   What is the consumption function?

-   What is the equilibrium?

-   Why is a national income of $300 not at equilibrium?

-   How do expenditures and output compare at this point?

Table B4

  

Step 1. Calculate the amount of taxes for each level of national
income(reminder: GDP = national income) for each level of national
income using the following as an example:

National Income (Y) $300 Taxes = 0.2 or 20% × 0.2 Tax amount (T) $60

Step 2. Calculate after-tax income by subtracting the tax amount from
national income for each level of national income using the following as
an example:

National income minus taxes $300

–$60

After-tax income $240

Step 3. Calculate consumption. The marginal propensity to save is given
as 0.1. This means that the marginal propensity to consume is 0.9, since
MPS + MPC = 1. Therefore, multiply 0.9 by the after-tax income amount
using the following as an example:

After-tax Income $240 MPC × 0.9

Consumption $216

Step 4. Consider why the table shows consumption of $236 in the first
row. As mentioned earlier, the Keynesian model assumes that there is
some level of consumption even without income. That amount is $236 –
$216 = $20.

<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_457.png" width="624" height="891" alt="image" />

  

Step 5. There is now enough information to write the consumption
function. The consumption function is found by figuring out the level of
consumption that will happen when income is zero. Remember that:

C = Consumption when national income is zero + MPC (after-tax income)

Let C represent the consumption function, Y represent national income,
and T represent taxes.

C = $20 + 0.9(Y – T)

= $20 + 0.9($300 – $60)

= $236

Step 6. Use the consumption function to find consumption at each level
of national income.

Step 7. Add investment (I), government spending (G), and exports (X).
Remember that these do not change as national income changes:

Step 8. Find imports, which are 0.2 of after-tax income at each level of
national income. For example:

After-tax income $240 Imports of 0.2 or 20% of Y – T × 0.2 Imports $48

<a href="#bookmark1816" class="s48">Step 9. Find aggregate expenditure by adding C + I + G + X – I for each level of national income. Your completed table should look like</a>

<a href="#bookmark1816" class="s48">Step 10. Answer the question: What is equilibrium? Equilibrium occurs where AE = Y.</a>
<a href="#bookmark1816" class="a">Table</a> [B5](#bookmark1816)

shows that equilibrium occurs where national income equals aggregate
expenditure at $500.

Step 11. Find equilibrium mathematically, knowing that national income
is equal to aggregate expenditure.

Y = AE

= C + I + G + X – M

= $20 + 0.9(Y – T) + $70 + $80 + $50 – 0.2(Y – T)

= $220 + 0.9(Y – T) – 0.2(Y – T)

  

Since T is 0.2 of national income, substitute T with 0.2 Y so that:

Y = $220 + 0.9(Y – 0.2Y) – 0.2(Y – 0.2Y)

= $220 + 0.9Y – 0.18Y – 0.2Y + 0.04Y

= $220 + 0.56Y

<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_459.png" width="624" height="237" alt="image" />

Solve for Y.

Y = $220 + 0.56Y Y – 0.56Y = $220

0.44Y = $220

0.44

Y = $500

0.44

Step 12. Answer this question: Why is a national income of $300 not an
equilibrium? At national income of $300, aggregate expenditures are
$388.

Step 13. Answer this question: How do expenditures and output compare at
this point? Aggregate expenditures cannot exceed output (GDP) in the
long run, since there would not be enough goods to be bought.

Recessionary and Inflationary Gaps

In the Keynesian cross diagram, if the aggregate expenditure line
intersects the 45-degree line at the level of potential GDP, then the
economy is in sound shape. There is no recession, and unemployment is
low. But there is no guarantee that the equilibrium will occur at the
potential GDP level of output. The equilibrium might be higher or lower.

<a href="#bookmark1818" id="bookmark1817" class="s34">For example,</a>
<a href="#bookmark1818" class="a">Figure B9</a><span class="s54">
</span>(a) illustrates a situation where the aggregate expenditure line
intersects the 45-degree line at point E<span class="s60">0</span>,
which is a real GDP of $6,000, and which is below the potential GDP of
$7,000. In this situation, the level of aggregate expenditure is too low
for GDP to reach its full employment level, and unemployment will occur.
The distance between an output level like E<span class="s60">0</span>
that is below potential GDP and the level of potential GDP is called a
recessionary gap. Because the equilibrium level of real GDP is so low,
firms will not wish to hire the full employment number of workers, and
unemployment will be high.

  

<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_460.jpg" width="557" height="279" alt="image" />

<span id="bookmark1818"><span class="s36">Figure B9 Addressing
Recessionary and Inflationary Gaps </span></span>(a) If the equilibrium
occurs at an output below potential GDP, then a recessionary gap exists.
The policy solution to a recessionary gap is to shift the aggregate
expenditure schedule up from AE<span class="s63">0</span> to AE<span
class="s63">1</span>, using policies like tax cuts or government
spending increases. Then the new equilibrium E<span class="s63">1</span>
occurs at potential GDP. (b) If the equilibrium occurs at an output
above potential GDP, then an inflationary gap exists. The policy
solution to an inflationary gap is to shift the aggregate expenditure
schedule down from AE<span class="s63">0</span> to AE<span
class="s63">1</span>, using policies like tax increases or spending
cuts. Then, the new equilibrium E<span class="s63">1</span> occurs at
potential GDP.

  

What might cause a recessionary gap? Anything that shifts the aggregate
expenditure line down is a potential cause of recession, including a
decline in consumption, a rise in savings, a fall in investment, a drop
in government spending or a rise in taxes, or a fall in exports or a
rise in imports. Moreover, an economy that is at equilibrium with a
recessionary

  

gap may just stay there and suffer high unemployment for a long time;
remember, the meaning of equilibrium is that there is no particular
adjustment of prices or quantities in the economy to chase the recession
away.

The appropriate response to a recessionary gap is for the government to
reduce taxes or increase spending so that the aggregate expenditure
function shifts up from AE<span class="s60">0</span> to AE<span
class="s60">1</span>. When this shift occurs, the new equilibrium E<span
class="s60">1</span>
<a href="#bookmark1818" class="s34">now occurs at potential GDP as shown in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1818" class="a">Figure B9</a><span class="s54">
</span>(a).

<a href="#bookmark1818" id="bookmark1819" class="s34">Conversely,</a>
<a href="#bookmark1818" class="a">Figure</a> <span class="s54">B9
</span>(b) shows a situation where the aggregate expenditure schedule
(AE<span class="s60">0</span>) intersects the 45-degree line above
potential GDP. The gap between the level of real GDP at the equilibrium
E<span class="s60">0</span> and potential GDP is called an inflationary
gap. The inflationary gap also requires a bit of interpreting. After
all, a naïve reading of the Keynesian cross diagram might suggest that
if the aggregate expenditure function is just pushed up high enough,
real GDP can be as large as desired—even doubling or tripling the
potential GDP level of the economy. This implication is clearly wrong.
An economy faces some supply-side limits on how much it can produce at a
given time with its existing quantities of workers, physical and human
capital, technology, and market institutions.

The inflationary gap should be interpreted, not as a literal prediction
of how large real GDP will be, but as a statement of how much extra
aggregate expenditure is in the economy beyond what is needed to reach
potential GDP. An inflationary gap suggests that because the economy
cannot produce enough goods and services to absorb this level of
aggregate expenditures, the spending will instead cause an inflationary
increase in the price level. In this way, even though changes in the
price level do not appear explicitly in the Keynesian cross equation,
the notion of inflation is implicit in the concept of the inflationary
gap.

<a href="#bookmark1818" class="s34">The appropriate Keynesian response to an inflationary gap is shown in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1818" class="a">Figure B9</a><span class="s54">
</span>(b). The original intersection of aggregate expenditure line
AE<span class="s60">0</span> and the 45-degree line occurs at $8,000,
which is above the level of potential GDP at $7,000. If AE<span
class="s60">0</span> shifts down to AE<span class="s60">1</span>, so
that the new equilibrium is at E<span class="s60">1</span>, then the
economy will be at potential GDP without pressures for inflationary
price increases. The government can achieve a downward shift in
aggregate expenditure by increasing taxes on consumers or firms, or by
reducing government expenditures.

#### <span id="bookmark1782">The Multiplier Effect</span>

The Keynesian policy prescription has one final twist. Assume that for a
certain economy, the intersection of the aggregate expenditure function
and the 45-degree line is at a GDP of 700, while the level of potential
GDP for this economy is $800. By how much does government spending need
to be increased so that the economy reaches the full employment GDP? The
obvious answer might seem to be $800 – $700 = $100; so raise government
spending by

<span id="bookmark1820">$100. But that answer is incorrect. A change of,
for example, $100 in government expenditures will have an effect of more
than $100 on the equilibrium level of real GDP. The reason is that a
change in aggregate expenditures circles through the economy: households
buy from firms, firms pay workers and suppliers, workers and suppliers
buy goods from other firms, those firms pay their workers and suppliers,
and so on. In this way, the original change in aggregate expenditures is
actually spent more than once. This is called the multiplier effect: An
initial increase in spending, cycles repeatedly through the economy and
has a larger impact than the initial dollar amount spent.</span>

How Does the Multiplier Work?

To understand how the multiplier effect works, return to the example in
which the current equilibrium in the Keynesian cross diagram is a real
GDP of $700, or $100 short of the $800 needed to be at full employment,
potential GDP. If the government spends $100 to close this gap, someone
in the economy receives that spending and can treat it as income. Assume
that those who receive this income pay 30% in taxes, save 10% of
after-tax income, spend 10% of total income on imports, and then spend
the rest on domestically produced goods and services.

<a href="#bookmark1821" class="s34">As shown in the calculations in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1821" class="a">Figure B10</a>
<a href="#bookmark1822" class="s34">and</a> Table
B6<a href="#bookmark1821" class="s34">, out of the original $100 in government spending, $53 is left to spend on domestically produced goods and services. That $53 which was spent, becomes income to someone, somewhere in the economy. Those who receive that income also pay 30% in taxes, save 10% of after-tax income, and spend 10% of total income on imports, as shown in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1821" class="a">Figure</a> B10<span class="p">, so
that an additional $28.09 (that is, 0.53 × $53) is spent in the third
round. The people who receive that income then pay taxes, save, and buy
imports, and the amount spent in the fourth round is $14.89 (that is,
0.53 × $28.09).</span>

  

<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_461.jpg" width="448" height="218" alt="image" />

<span id="bookmark1821">Figure B10 The Multiplier Effect</span> <span
class="s37">An original increase of government spending of $100 causes a
rise in aggregate expenditure of $100. But that $100 is income to others
in the economy, and after they save, pay taxes, and buy imports, they
spend $53 of that $100 in a second round. In turn, that $53 is income to
others. Thus, the original government spending of $100 is multiplied by
these cycles of spending, but the impact of each successive cycle gets
smaller and smaller. Given the numbers in this example, the original
government spending increase of $100 raises aggregate expenditure by
$213; therefore, the multiplier in this example is $213/$100 =
2.13.</span>

Table B6 Calculating the Multiplier Effect

  

<a href="#bookmark1821" class="s34">Thus, over the first four rounds of aggregate expenditures, the impact of the original increase in government spending of $100 creates a rise in aggregate expenditures of $100 + $53 + $28.09 + $14.89 = $195.98.</a>
<a href="#bookmark1821" class="a">Figure B10</a> <span class="p">shows
these total aggregate expenditures after these first four rounds, and
then the figure shows the total aggregate expenditures after 30 rounds.
The additional boost to aggregate expenditures is shrinking in each
round of consumption. After about 10 rounds, the additional increments
are very small indeed—nearly invisible to the naked eye. After 30
rounds, the additional increments in each round are so small that they
have no practical consequence. After 30 rounds, the cumulative value of
the initial boost in aggregate expenditure is approximately $213. Thus,
the government spending increase of $100 eventually, after many cycles,
produced an increase of $213 in aggregate expenditure and real GDP. In
this example, the multiplier is $213/$100 = 2.13.</span>

Calculating the Multiplier

Fortunately for everyone who is not carrying around a computer with a
spreadsheet program to project the impact of an original increase in
expenditures over 20, 50, or 100 rounds of spending, there is a formula
for calculating the multiplier.

Spending Multiplier = 1/(1 – MPC \* (1 – tax rate) + MPI)

<a href="#bookmark1821" class="s34">The data from</a>
<a href="#bookmark1821" class="a">Figure B10</a>
<a href="#bookmark1822" class="s34">and</a>
<a href="#bookmark1822" class="a">Table B6</a> <span
class="p">is:</span>

  

  

-   Marginal Propensity to Save (MPS) = 30%

-   Tax rate = 10%

-   Marginal Propensity to Import (MPI) = 10%

The MPC is equal to 1 – MPS, or 0.7. Therefore, the spending multiplier
is:

Spending Multiplier =

                      1                      

1 – (0.7 – (0.10)(0.7) – 0.10)

=

  1  

0.47

= 2.13

<a href="#bookmark1821" class="s34">A change in spending of $100 multiplied by the spending multiplier of 2.13 is equal to a change in GDP of $213. Not coincidentally, this result is exactly what was calculated in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1821" class="a">Figure B10</a> <span class="p">after
many rounds of expenditures cycling through the economy.</span>

The size of the multiplier is determined by what proportion of the
marginal dollar of income goes into taxes, saving, and imports. These
three factors are known as “leakages,” because they determine how much
demand “leaks out” in each round of the multiplier effect. If the
leakages are relatively small, then each successive round of the
multiplier effect will have larger amounts of demand, and the multiplier
will be high. Conversely, if the leakages are relatively large, then any
initial change in demand will diminish more quickly in the second,
third, and later rounds, and the multiplier will be small. Changes in
the size of the leakages—a change in the marginal propensity to save,
the tax rate, or the marginal propensity to import—will change the size
of the multiplier.

Calculating Keynesian Policy Interventions

<a href="#bookmark1823" class="s34">Returning to the original question: How much should government spending be increased to produce a total increase in real GDP of $100? If the goal is to increase aggregate demand by $100, and the multiplier is 2.13, then the increase in government spending to achieve that goal would be $100/2.13 = $47. Government spending of approximately $47, when combined with a multiplier of 2.13 (which is, remember, based on the specific assumptions about tax, saving, and import rates), produces an overall increase in real GDP of $100, restoring the economy to potential GDP of $800, as</a>
<a href="#bookmark1823" class="a">Figure B11</a> <span
class="p">shows.</span>

  

  

<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_462.jpg" width="262" height="243" alt="image" />

  

<span id="bookmark1823"><span class="s36">Figure B11 The Multiplier
Effect in an Expenditure-Output Model </span></span>The power of the
multiplier effect is that an increase in expenditure has a larger
increase on the equilibrium output. The increase in expenditure is the
vertical increase from AE<span class="s63">0</span> to AE<span
class="s63">1</span>. However, the increase in equilibrium output, shown
on the horizontal axis, is clearly larger.

  

<a href="#bookmark1823" class="s34">The multiplier effect is also visible on the Keynesian cross diagram.</a>
<a href="#bookmark1823" class="a">Figure B11</a><span class="s54">
</span>shows the example we have been discussing: a recessionary gap
with an equilibrium of $700, potential GDP of $800, the slope of the
aggregate expenditure function (AE<span class="s60">0</span>) determined
by the assumptions that taxes are 30% of income, savings are 0.1 of
after-tax income, and imports are 0.1 of before-tax income. At AE<span
class="s60">1</span>, the aggregate expenditure function is moved up to
reach potential GDP.

  

  

<a href="#bookmark1818" class="s34">Now, compare the vertical shift upward in the aggregate expenditure function, which is $47, with the horizontal shift outward in real GDP, which is $100 (as these numbers were calculated earlier). The rise in real GDP is more than double the rise in the aggregate expenditure function. (Similarly, if you look back at</a>
<a href="#bookmark1818" class="a">Figure</a> B9<span class="p">, you
will see that the vertical movements in the aggregate expenditure
functions are smaller than the change in equilibrium output that is
produced on the horizontal axis. Again, this is the multiplier effect at
work.) In this way, the power of the multiplier is apparent in the
income–expenditure graph, as well as in the arithmetic
calculation.</span>

<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_463.png" width="624" height="701" alt="image" />

The multiplier does not just affect government spending, but applies to
any change in the economy. Say that business confidence declines and
investment falls off, or that the economy of a leading trading partner
slows down so that export sales decline. These changes will reduce
aggregate expenditures, and then will have an even larger effect on real
GDP because of the multiplier effect. Read the following Clear It Up
feature to learn how the multiplier effect can be applied to analyze the
economic impact of professional sports.

  

How can the multiplier be used to analyze the economic impact of
professional sports?

Attracting professional sports teams and building sports stadiums to
create jobs and stimulate business growth is an economic development
strategy adopted by many communities throughout the United States. In
his recent article, “Public Financing of Private Sports Stadiums,” James
Joyner of *Outside the Beltway* looked at public financing for NFL
teams. Joyner’s findings confirm the earlier work of John Siegfried of
Vanderbilt University and Andrew Zimbalist of Smith College.

Siegfried and Zimbalist used the multiplier to analyze this issue. They
considered the amount of taxes paid and dollars spent locally to see if
there was a positive multiplier effect. Since most professional athletes
and owners of sports teams are rich enough to owe a lot of taxes, let’s
say that 40% of any marginal income they earn is paid in taxes. Because
athletes are often high earners with short careers, let’s assume that
they save one-third of their after-tax income.

However, many professional athletes do not live year-round in the city
in which they play, so let’s say that one-half of the money that they do
spend is spent outside the local area. One can think of spending outside
a local economy, in this example, as the equivalent of imported goods
for the national economy.

Now, consider the impact of money spent at local entertainment venues
other than professional sports. While the owners of these other
businesses may be comfortably middle-income, few of them are in the
economic stratosphere of professional athletes. Because their incomes
are lower, so are their taxes; say that they pay only 35% of their
marginal income in taxes. They do not have the same ability, or need, to
save as much as professional athletes, so let’s assume their MPC is just
0.8. Finally, because more of them live locally, they will spend a
higher proportion of their income on local goods—say, 65%.

If these general assumptions hold true, then money spent on professional
sports will have less local economic impact than money spent on other
forms of entertainment. For professional athletes, out of a dollar
earned, 40 cents goes to taxes, leaving 60 cents. Of that 60 cents,
one-third is saved, leaving 40 cents, and half is spent outside the
area, leaving 20 cents. Only 20 cents of each dollar is cycled into the
local economy in the first round. For locally-owned entertainment, out
of a dollar earned, 35 cents goes to taxes, leaving 65 cents. Of the
rest, 20% is saved, leaving 52 cents, and of that amount, 65% is spent
in the local area, so that 33.8 cents of each dollar of income is
recycled into the local economy.

Siegfried and Zimbalist make the plausible argument that, within their
household budgets, people have a fixed amount to spend on entertainment.
If this assumption holds true, then money spent attending professional
sports events is money that was not spent on other entertainment options
in a given metropolitan area. Since the multiplier is lower for
professional sports than for other local entertainment options, the
arrival of professional sports to a city would reallocate entertainment

  

spending in a way that causes the local economy to shrink, rather than
to grow. Thus, their findings seem to confirm what Joyner reports and
what newspapers across the country are reporting. A quick Internet
search for “economic impact of sports” will yield numerous reports
questioning this economic development strategy.

  

Multiplier Tradeoffs: Stability versus the Power of Macroeconomic Policy

Is an economy healthier with a high multiplier or a low one? With a high
multiplier, any change in aggregate demand will tend to be substantially
magnified, and so the economy will be more unstable. With a low
multiplier, by contrast, changes in aggregate demand will not be
multiplied much, so the economy will tend to be more stable.

However, with a low multiplier, government policy changes in taxes or
spending will tend to have less impact on the equilibrium level of real
output. With a higher multiplier, government policies to raise or reduce
aggregate expenditures will have a larger effect. Thus, a low multiplier
means a more stable economy, but also weaker government macroeconomic
policy, while a high multiplier means a more volatile economy, but also
an economy in which government macroeconomic policy is more powerful.

#### <span id="bookmark1783">Key Concepts and Summary</span>

The expenditure-output model or Keynesian cross diagram shows how the
level of aggregate expenditure (on the vertical axis) varies with the
level of economic output (shown on the horizontal axis). Since the value
of all macroeconomic output also represents income to someone somewhere
else in the economy, the horizontal axis can also be interpreted as
national income. The equilibrium in the diagram will occur where the
aggregate expenditure line crosses the 45-degree line, which represents
the set of points where aggregate expenditure in the economy is equal to
output (or national income). Equilibrium in a Keynesian cross diagram
can happen at potential GDP, or below or above that level.

The consumption function shows the upward-sloping relationship between
national income and consumption. The marginal propensity to consume
(MPC) is the amount consumed out of an additional dollar of income. A
higher marginal propensity to consume means a steeper consumption
function; a lower marginal propensity to consume means a flatter
consumption function. The marginal propensity to save (MPS) is the
amount saved out of an additional dollar of income. It is necessarily
true that MPC + MPS = 1. The investment function is drawn as a flat
line, showing that investment in the current year does not change with
regard to the current level of national income. However, the investment
function will move up and down based on the expected rate of return in
the future. Government spending is drawn as a horizontal line in the
Keynesian cross diagram, because its level is determined by political
considerations, not by the current level of income in the economy. Taxes
in the basic Keynesian cross diagram are taken into account by adjusting
the consumption function. The export function is drawn as a horizontal
line in the Keynesian cross diagram, because exports do not change as a
result of changes in domestic income, but they move as a result of
changes in foreign income, as well as changes in exchange rates. The
import function is drawn as a downward-sloping line, because imports
rise with national income, but imports are a subtraction from aggregate
demand. Thus, a higher level of imports means a lower level of
expenditure on domestic goods.

In a Keynesian cross diagram, the equilibrium may be at a level below
potential GDP, which is called a recessionary gap, or at a level above
potential GDP, which is called an inflationary gap.

The multiplier effect describes how an initial change in aggregate
demand generated several times as much as cumulative GDP. The size of
the spending multiplier is determined by three leakages: spending on
savings, taxes, and imports. The formula for the multiplier is:

Multiplier =

                          1                          <span class="s16">
1 – (MPC × (1 – tax rate) + MPI)</span>

An economy with a lower multiplier is more stable—it is less affected
either by economic events or by government policy than an economy with a
higher multiplier.

Exercise B3

An economy has the following characteristics: Y = National income

  

  

Taxes = T = 0.25Y

C = Consumption = 400 + 0.85(Y – T) I = 300

G = 200

X = 500

M = 0.1(Y – T)

Find the equilibrium for this economy. If potential GDP is 3,500, then
what change in government spending is needed to achieve this level? Do
this problem two ways. First, plug 3,500 into the equations and solve
for G. Second, calculate the multiplier and figure it out that way.

  

Solution

First, set up the calculation.

  

AE = 400 + 0.85(Y – T) + 300 + 200 + 500 – 0.1(Y – T) AE = Y

Then insert Y for AE and 0.25Y for T.

Y = 400 + 0.85(Y – 0.25Y) + 300 + 200 + 500 – 0.1(Y – 0.25Y) Y = 1400 +
0.6375Y – 0.075Y

0.4375Y = 1400

Y = 3200

If full employment is 3,500, then one approach is to plug in 3,500 for Y
throughout the equation, but to leave G as a separate variable.

Y = 400 + 0.85(Y – 0.25Y) + 300 + G + 500 + 0.1(Y – 0.25Y)

3500 = 400 + 0.85(3500 – 0.25(3500)) + 300 + G + 500 – 0.1(3500 –
0.25(3500))

G = 3500 – 400 – 2231.25 – 1300 – 500 + 262.5

G = 331.25

A G value of 331.25 is an increase of 131.25 from its original level of
200.

Alternatively, the multiplier is that, out of every dollar spent, 0.25
goes to taxes, leaving 0.75, and out of after-tax income, 0.15 goes to
savings and 0.1 to imports. Because (0.75)(0.15) = 0.1125 and
(0.75)(0.1) = 0.075, this means

that out of every dollar spent: 1 –0.25 –0.1125 –0.075 = 0.5625. Thus,
using the formula, the multiplier is:

       1        

1 – 0.5625

= 2.2837

To increase equilibrium GDP by 300, it will take a boost of 300/2.2837,
which again works out to 131.25.

Exercise B4

<a href="#bookmark1824" class="a">Table B7</a> <span
class="p">represents the data behind a Keynesian cross diagram. Assume
that the tax rate is 0.4 of national income; the MPC out of the
after-tax income is 0.8; investment is $2,000; government spending is
$1,000; exports are $2,000 and imports are 0.05 of after-tax income.

Table B8

  

The alternative way of determining equilibrium is to solve for Y, where
Y = national income, using: Y = AE = C + I

\+ G + X – M

Y = $500 + 0.8(Y – T) + $2,000 + $1,000 + $2,000 – 0.05(Y – T)

Solving for Y, we see that the equilibrium level of output is Y =
$10,000.

Exercise B5

Explain how the multiplier works. Use an MPC of 80% in an example.

  

Solution

The multiplier refers to how many times a dollar will turnover in the
economy. It is based on the Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC) which
tells how much of every dollar received will be spent. If the MPC is 80%
then this means that out of every one dollar received by a consumer,
$0.80 will be spent. This $0.80 is received by another person. In turn,
80% of the $0.80 received, or $0.64, will be spent, and so on. The
impact of the multiplier is diluted when the effect of taxes and
expenditure on imports is considered. To derive the multiplier, take the
1/1 – F; where F is equal to percent of savings, taxes, and expenditures
on imports.

### <span id="bookmark1825">ANSWER KEY</span>

<span id="bookmark1826">Chapter 1</span>

1.  Scarcity means human wants for goods and services exceed the
    available supply. Supply is limited because resources are limited.
    Demand, however, is virtually unlimited. Whatever the supply, it
    seems human nature to want more.

2.  100 people / 10 people per ham = a maximum of 10 hams per month if
    all residents produce ham. Since consumption is limited by
    production, the maximum number of hams residents could consume per
    month is 10.

3.  She is very productive at her consulting job, but not very
    productive growing vegetables. Time spent consulting would produce
    far more income than it what she could save growing her vegetables
    using the same amount of time. So on purely economic grounds, it
    makes more sense for her to maximize her income by applying her
    labor to what she does best (i.e. specialization of labor).

4.  The engineer is better at computer science than at painting. Thus,
    his time is better spent working for pay at his job and paying a
    painter to paint his house. Of course, this assumes he does not
    paint his house for fun!

5.  There are many physical systems that would work, for example, the
    study of planets (micro) in the solar system (macro), or solar
    systems (micro) in the galaxy (macro).

6.  Draw a box outside the original circular flow to represent the
    foreign country. Draw an arrow from the foreign country to firms, to
    represents imports. Draw an arrow in the reverse direction
    representing payments for imports. Draw an arrow from firms to the
    foreign country to represent exports. Draw an arrow in the reverse
    direction to represent payments for imports.

7.  There are many such problems. Consider the AIDS epidemic. Why are so
    few AIDS patients in Africa and Southeast Asia treated with the same
    drugs that are effective in the United States and Europe? It is
    because neither those patients nor the countries in which they live
    have the resources to purchase the same drugs.

8.  Public enterprise means the factors of production (resources and
    businesses) are owned and operated by the government.

9.  The United States is a large country economically speaking, so it
    has less need to trade internationally than the other countries
    mentioned. (This is the same reason that France and Italy have lower
    ratios than Belgium or Sweden.) One additional reason is that each
    of the other countries is a member of the European Union, where
    trade between members occurs without barriers to trade, like tariffs
    and quotas.

  

<span id="bookmark1827">Chapter 2</span>

1.  The opportunity cost of bus tickets is the number of burgers that
    must be given up to obtain one more bus ticket. Originally, when the
    price of bus tickets was 50 cents per trip, this opportunity cost
    was 0.50/2 = .25 burgers. The reason for this is that at the
    original prices, one burger ($2) costs the same as four bus tickets
    ($0.50), so the opportunity cost of a burger is four bus tickets,
    and the opportunity cost of a bus ticket is .25 (the inverse of the
    opportunity cost of a burger). With the new, higher price of bus
    tickets, the opportunity cost rises to $1/$2 or 0.50. You can see
    this graphically since the slope of the new budget constraint is
    steeper than the original one. If Alphonso spends all of his budget
    on burgers, the higher price of bus tickets has no impact so the
    vertical intercept of the budget constraint is the same. If he
    spends all of his budget on bus tickets, he can now afford only half
    as many, so the vertical intercept is half as much. In short, the
    budget constraint rotates clockwise around the vertical intercept,
    steepening as it goes and the opportunity cost of bus tickets
    increases.

2.  Because of the improvement in technology, the vertical intercept of
    the PPF would be at a higher level of healthcare. In other words,
    the PPF would rotate clockwise around the horizontal intercept. This
    would make the PPF steeper, corresponding to an increase in the
    opportunity cost of education, since resources devoted to education
    would now mean forgoing a greater quantity of healthcare.

3.  No. Allocative efficiency requires productive efficiency, because it
    pertains to choices along the production possibilities frontier.

4.  Both the budget constraint and the PPF show the constraint that each
    operates under. Both show a tradeoff between having more of one good
    but less of the other. Both show the opportunity cost graphically as
    the slope of the constraint (budget or PPF).

5.  When individuals compare cost per unit in the grocery store, or
    characteristics of one product versus another, they are behaving
    approximately like the model describes.

6.  Since an op-ed makes a case for what should be, it is considered
    normative.

7.  Assuming that the study is not taking an explicit position about
    whether soft drink consumption is good or bad, but just reporting
    the science, it would be considered positive.

  

<span id="bookmark1828">Chapter 3</span>

1.  Since $1.60 per gallon is above the equilibrium price, the quantity
    demanded would be lower at 550 gallons and the quantity supplied
    would be higher at 640 gallons. (These results are due to the laws
    of demand and supply, respectively.) The outcome of lower Qd and
    higher Qs would be a surplus in the gasoline market of 640 – 550 =
    90 gallons.

2.  To make it easier to analyze complex problems. *Ceteris paribus*
    allows you to look at the effect of one factor at a time on what it
    is you are trying to analyze. When you have analyzed all the factors
    individually, you add the results together to get the final answer.

    1.  An improvement in technology that reduces the cost of production
        will cause an increase in supply. Alternatively, you can think
        of this as a reduction in price necessary for firms to supply
        any quantity. Either way, this can be shown as a rightward (or
        downward) shift in the supply curve.

    2.  An improvement in product quality is treated as an increase in
        tastes or preferences, meaning consumers demand more paint at
        any price level, so demand increases or shifts to the right. If
        this seems counterintuitive, note that demand in the future for
        the longer-lasting paint will fall, since consumers are
        essentially shifting demand from the future to the present.

    3.  An increase in need causes an increase in demand or a rightward
        shift in the demand curve.

    4.  Factory damage means that firms are unable to supply as much in
        the present. Technically, this is an increase in the cost of
        production. Either way you look at it, the supply curve shifts
        to the left.

<span
style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Liberation Serif&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; font-size: 9pt;">4</span>.

1.  More fuel-efficient cars means there is less need for gasoline. This
    causes a leftward shift in the demand for gasoline and thus oil.
    Since the demand curve is shifting down the supply curve, the
    equilibrium price and

      

    quantity both fall.

2.  Cold weather increases the need for heating oil. This causes a
    rightward shift in the demand for heating oil and thus oil. Since
    the demand curve is shifting up the supply curve, the equilibrium
    price and quantity both rise.

3.  A discovery of new oil will make oil more abundant. This can be
    shown as a rightward shift in the supply curve, which will cause a
    decrease in the equilibrium price along with an increase in the
    equilibrium quantity. (The supply curve shifts down the demand curve
    so price and quantity follow the law of demand. If price goes down,
    then the quantity goes up.)

4.  When an economy slows down, it produces less output and demands less
    input, including energy, which is used in the production of
    virtually everything. A decrease in demand for energy will be
    reflected as a decrease in the demand for oil, or a leftward shift
    in demand for oil. Since the demand curve is shifting down the
    supply curve, both the equilibrium price and quantity of oil will
    fall.

5.  Disruption of oil pumping will reduce the supply of oil. This
    leftward shift in the supply curve will show a movement up the
    demand curve, resulting in an increase in the equilibrium price of
    oil and a decrease in the equilibrium quantity.

6.  Increased insulation will decrease the demand for heating. This
    leftward shift in the demand for oil causes a movement down the
    supply curve, resulting in a decrease in the equilibrium price and
    quantity of oil.

7.  Solar energy is a substitute for oil-based energy. So if solar
    energy becomes cheaper, the demand for oil will decrease as
    consumers switch from oil to solar. The decrease in demand for oil
    will be shown as a leftward shift in the demand curve. As the demand
    curve shifts down the supply curve, both equilibrium price and
    quantity for oil will fall.

8.  A new, popular kind of plastic will increase the demand for oil. The
    increase in demand will be shown as a rightward shift in demand,
    raising the equilibrium price and quantity of oil.

1.  Step 1. Draw the graph with the initial supply and demand curves.
    Label the initial equilibrium price and quantity. Step 2. Did the
    economic event affect supply or demand? Jet fuel is a cost of
    producing air travel, so an increase in jet fuel price affects
    supply. Step 3. An increase in the price of jet fuel caused a
    decrease in the cost of air travel. We show this as a downward or
    rightward shift in supply. Step 4. A rightward shift in supply
    causes a movement down the demand curve, lowering the equilibrium
    price of air travel and increasing the equilibrium quantity.

2.  Step 1. Draw the graph with the initial supply and demand curves.
    Label the initial equilibrium price and quantity. Step 2. Did the
    economic event affect supply or demand? A tariff is treated like a
    cost of production, so this affects supply. Step 3. A tariff
    reduction is equivalent to a decrease in the cost of production,
    which we can show as a rightward (or downward) shift in supply.
    Step 4. A rightward shift in supply causes a movement down the
    demand curve, lowering the equilibrium price and raising the
    equilibrium quantity.

3.  A price ceiling (which is below the equilibrium price) will cause
    the quantity demanded to rise and the quantity supplied to fall.
    This is why a price ceiling creates a shortage.

4.  A price ceiling is just a legal restriction. Equilibrium is an
    economic condition. People may or may not obey the price ceiling, so
    the actual price may be at or above the price ceiling, but the price
    ceiling does not change the equilibrium price.

5.  A price ceiling is a legal maximum price, but a price floor is a
    legal minimum price and, consequently, it would leave room for the
    price to rise to its equilibrium level. In other words, a price
    floor below equilibrium will not be binding and will have no effect.

6.  Assuming that people obey the price ceiling, the market price will
    be below equilibrium, which means that Qd will be more than Qs.
    Buyers can only buy what is offered for sale, so the number of
    transactions will fall to Qs. This is easy to see graphically. By
    analogous reasoning, with a price floor the market price will be
    above the equilibrium price, so Qd will be less than Qs. Since the
    limit on transactions here is demand, the number of transactions
    will fall to Qd. Note that because both price floors and price
    ceilings reduce the number of transactions, social surplus is less.

7.  Because the losses to consumers are greater than the benefits to
    producers, so the net effect is negative. Since the

  

lost consumer surplus is greater than the additional producer surplus,
social surplus falls.

  

<span id="bookmark1829">Chapter 4</span>

1.  Changes in the wage rate (the price of labor) cause a movement along
    the demand curve. A change in anything else that affects demand for
    labor (e.g., changes in output, changes in the production process
    that use more or less labor, government regulation) causes a shift
    in the demand curve.

2.  Changes in the wage rate (the price of labor) cause a movement along
    the supply curve. A change in anything else that affects supply of
    labor (e.g., changes in how desirable the job is perceived to be,
    government policy to promote training in the field) causes a shift
    in the supply curve.

3.  Since a living wage is a suggested minimum wage, it acts like a
    price floor (assuming, of course, that it is followed). If the
    living wage is binding, it will cause an excess supply of labor at
    that wage rate.

4.  Changes in the interest rate (i.e., the price of financial capital)
    cause a movement along the demand curve. A change in anything else
    (non-price variable) that affects demand for financial capital
    (e.g., changes in confidence about the future, changes in needs for
    borrowing) would shift the demand curve.

5.  Changes in the interest rate (i.e., the price of financial capital)
    cause a movement along the supply curve. A change in anything else
    that affects the supply of financial capital (a non-price variable)
    such as income or future needs would shift the supply curve.

6.  If market interest rates stay in their normal range, an interest
    rate limit of 35% would not be binding. If the equilibrium interest
    rate rose above 35%, the interest rate would be capped at that rate,
    and the quantity of loans would be lower than the equilibrium
    quantity, causing a shortage of loans.

7.  b and c will lead to a fall in interest rates. At a lower demand,
    lenders will not be able to charge as much, and with more available
    lenders, competition for borrowers will drive rates down.

8.  a and c will increase the quantity of loans. More people who want to
    borrow will result in more loans being given, as will more people
    who want to lend.

9.  A price floor prevents a price from falling below a certain level,
    but has no effect on prices above that level. It will have its
    biggest effect in creating excess supply (as measured by the entire
    area inside the dotted lines on the graph, from D to S) if it is
    substantially above the equilibrium price. This is illustrated in
    the following figure.

      

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_467.jpg" width="275" height="250" alt="image" />

      

    It will have a lesser effect if it is slightly above the equilibrium
    price. This is illustrated in the next figure.

      

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_468.jpg" width="275" height="250" alt="image" />

      

    It will have no effect if it is set either slightly or substantially
    below the equilibrium price, since an equilibrium price above a
    price floor will not be affected by that price floor. The following
    figure illustrates these situations.

      

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_469.jpg" width="608" height="282" alt="image" />

      

10. A price ceiling prevents a price from rising above a certain level,
    but has no effect on prices below that level. It will have its
    biggest effect in creating excess demand if it is substantially
    below the equilibrium price. The following figure illustrates these
    situations.

      

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_470.jpg" width="602" height="288" alt="image" />

      

    When the price ceiling is set substantially or slightly above the
    equilibrium price, it will have no effect on creating excess demand.
    The following figure illustrates these situations.

      

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_471.jpg" width="621" height="288" alt="image" />

      

11. Neither. A shift in demand or supply means that at every price,
    either a greater or a lower quantity is demanded or supplied. A
    price floor does not shift a demand curve or a supply curve.
    However, if the price floor is set above the equilibrium, it will
    cause the quantity supplied on the supply curve to be greater than
    the quantity demanded on the demand curve, leading to excess supply.

12. Neither. A shift in demand or supply means that at every price,
    either a greater or a lower quantity is demanded or supplied. A
    price ceiling does not shift a demand curve or a supply curve.
    However, if the price ceiling is set below the equilibrium, it will
    cause the quantity demanded on the demand curve to be greater than
    the quantity supplied on the supply curve, leading to excess demand.

    88 – 80

    = 8.0

    8.0%

    Elasticity of Supply = <u>5.13%</u>

    = 0.64

    The supply curve is inelastic in this region of the supply curve.

3.  The demand curve with constant unitary elasticity is concave because
    the absolute value of declines in price are not identical. The left
    side of the curve starts with high prices, and then price falls by
    smaller amounts as it goes down toward the right side. This results
    in a slope of demand that is steeper on the left but flatter on the
    right, creating a curved, concave shape.

4.  The constant unitary elasticity is a straight line because the curve
    slopes upward and both price and quantity are increasing
    proportionally.

5.  Carmakers can pass this cost along to consumers if the demand for
    these cars is inelastic. If the demand for these cars is elastic,
    then the manufacturer must pay for the equipment.

6.  If the elasticity is 1.4 at current prices, you would advise the
    company to lower its price on the product, since a

      

    decrease in price will be offset by the increase in the amount of
    the drug sold. If the elasticity were 0.6, then you would advise the
    company to increase its price. Increases in price will offset the
    decrease in number of units sold, but increase your total revenue.
    If elasticity is 1, the total revenue is already maximized, and you
    would advise that the company maintain its current price level.

7.  The percentage change in quantity supplied as a result of a given
    percentage change in the price of gasoline.

= \[22 – 30\]/\[(22 + 30)/2\] × 100

= –30.77

Percentage change in income = \[(change in income)/(original income)\] ×
100

= \[38,000 – 25,000\]/\[(38,000 + 25,000)/2\] × 100

= 13/31.5 × 100

= 41.27

1.  From 1980 to 1990, real GDP grew by (8,225.0 – 5,926.5) / (5,926.5)
    = 39%. Over the same period, prices increased by (72.7 – 48.3) /
    (48.3/100) = 51%. So about 57% of the growth 51 / (51 + 39) was
    inflation, and the remainder: 39

    / (51 + 39) = 43% was growth in real GDP.

2.  Two other major recessions are visible in the figure as slight dips:
    those of 1973–1975, and 1981–1982. Two other recessions appear in
    the figure as a flattening of the path of real GDP. These were in
    1990–1991 and 2001.

3.  11 recessions in approximately 70 years averages about one recession
    every six years.

4.  The table lists the “Months of Contraction” for each recession.
    Averaging these figures for the post-WWII recessions gives an
    average duration of 11 months, or slightly less than a year.

5.  The table lists the “Months of Expansion.” Averaging these figures
    for the post-WWII expansions gives an average expansion of 60.5
    months, or more than five years.

6.  Yes. The answer to both questions depends on whether GDP is growing
    faster or slower than population. If population grows faster than
    GDP, GDP increases, while GDP per capita decreases. If GDP falls,
    but population falls faster, then GDP decreases, while GDP per
    capita increases.

      

7.  Start with Central African Republic’s GDP measured in francs. Divide
    it by the exchange rate to convert to U.S. dollars, and then divide
    by population to obtain the per capita figure. That is, 1,107,689
    million francs / 284.681 francs per dollar / 4.862 million people =
    $800.28 GDP per capita.

    1.  A dirtier environment would reduce the broad standard of living,
        but not be counted in GDP, so a rise in GDP would overstate the
        standard of living.

    2.  A lower crime rate would raise the broad standard of living, but
        not be counted directly in GDP, and so a rise in GDP would
        understate the standard of living.

    3.  A greater variety of goods would raise the broad standard of
        living, but not be counted directly in GDP, and so a rise in GDP
        would understate the rise in the standard of living.

    4.  A decline in infant mortality would raise the broad standard of
        living, but not be counted directly in GDP, and so a rise in GDP
        would understate the rise in the standard of living.

1.  The Industrial Revolution refers to the widespread use of
    power-driven machinery and the economic and social changes that
    resulted in the first half of the 1800s. Ingenious machines—the
    steam engine, the power loom, and the steam locomotive—performed
    tasks that would have taken vast numbers of workers to do. The
    Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain, and soon spread to the
    United States, Germany, and other countries.

2.  Property rights are the rights of individuals and firms to own
    property and use it as they see fit. Contractual rights are based on
    property rights and they allow individuals to enter into agreements
    with others regarding the use of their property providing recourse
    through the legal system in the event of noncompliance. Economic
    growth occurs when the standard of living increases in an economy,
    which occurs when output is increasing and incomes are rising. For
    this to happen, societies must create a legal environment that gives
    individuals the ability to use their property to their fullest and
    highest use, including the right to trade or sell that property.
    Without a legal system that enforces contracts, people would not be
    likely to enter into contracts for current or future services
    because of the risk of non-payment. This would make it difficult to
    transact business and would slow economic growth.

3.  Yes. Since productivity is output per unit of input, we can measure
    productivity using GDP (output) per worker (input).

4.  In 20 years the United States will have an income of 10,000 × (1 +
    0.01)<span class="s28">20</span> = $12,201.90, and South Korea will
    have an income of 10,000 × (1 + 0.04)<span class="s28">20</span> =
    $21,911.23. South Korea has grown by a multiple of 2.1 and the
    United States by a multiple of 1.2.

5.  Capital deepening and technology are important. What seems to be
    more important is how they are combined.

6.  Government can contribute to economic growth by investing in human
    capital through the education system, building a strong physical
    infrastructure for transportation and commerce, increasing
    investment by lowering capital gains taxes, creating special
    economic zones that allow for reduced tariffs, and investing in
    research and development.

7.  Public education, low investment taxes, funding for infrastructure
    projects, special economic zones

8.  A good way to think about this is how a runner who has fallen behind
    in a race feels psychologically and physically as he catches up.
    Playing catch-up can be more taxing than maintaining one’s position
    at the head of the pack.

    <span
    style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Liberation Serif&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; font-size: 9pt;">9</span>.

    1.  No. Capital deepening refers to an increase in the amount of
        capital per person in an economy. A decrease in investment by
        firms will actually cause the opposite of capital deepening
        (since the population will grow over time).

    2.  There is no direct connection between an increase in
        international trade and capital deepening. One could imagine
        particular scenarios where trade could lead to capital deepening
        (for example, if international capital

          

        inflows—which are the counterpart to increasing the trade
        deficit—lead to an increase in physical capital investment), but
        in general, no.

    3.  Yes. Capital deepening refers to an increase in either physical
        capital or human capital per person. Continuing education or any
        time of lifelong learning adds to human capital and thus creates
        capital deepening.

1.  The advantages of backwardness include faster growth rates because
    of the process of convergence, as well as the ability to adopt new
    technologies that were developed first in the “leader” countries.
    While being “backward” is not inherently a good thing, Gerschenkron
    stressed that there are certain advantages which aid countries
    trying to “catch up.”

2.  Capital deepening, by definition, should lead to diminished returns
    because you're investing more and more but using the same methods of
    production, leading to the marginal productivity declining. This is
    shown on a production function as a movement along the curve.
    Improvements in technology should not lead to diminished returns
    because you are finding new and more efficient ways of using the
    same amount of capital. This can be illustrated as a shift upward of
    the production function curve.

3.  Productivity growth from new advances in technology will not slow
    because the new methods of production will be adopted relatively
    quickly and easily, at very low marginal cost. Also, countries that
    are seeing technology growth usually have a vast and powerful set of
    institutions for training workers and building better machines,
    which allows the maximum amount of people to benefit from the new
    technology. These factors have the added effect of making additional
    technological advances even easier for these countries.

1.  The population is divided into those “in the labor force” and those
    “not in the labor force.” Thus, the number of adults not in the
    labor force is 237.8 – 153.9 = 83.9 million. Since the labor force
    is divided into employed persons and unemployed persons, the number
    of unemployed persons is 153.9 – 139.1 = 14.8 million. Thus, the
    adult population has the following proportions:

    -   139.1/237.8 = 58.5% employed persons

    -   14.8/237.8 = 6.2% unemployed persons

    -   83.9/237.8 = 35.3% persons out of the labor force

2.  The unemployment rate is defined as the number of unemployed persons
    as a percentage of the labor force or 14.8/

    153.9 = 9.6%. This is higher than the February 2015 unemployment
    rate, computed earlier, of 5.5%.

3.  Over the long term, the U.S. unemployment rate has remained
    basically the same level.

1.  Because of the influx of women into the labor market, the supply of
    labor shifts to the right. Since wages are sticky downward, the
    increased supply of labor causes an increase in people looking for
    jobs (Qs), but no change in the number of jobs available (Qe). As a
    result, unemployment increases by the amount of the increase in the
    labor supply. This can be seen in the following figure. Over time,
    as labor demand grows, the unemployment will decline and eventually
    wages will begin to increase again. But this increase in labor
    demand goes beyond the scope of this problem.

      

    <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_482.jpg" width="223" height="230" alt="image" />

      

2.  The increase in labor supply was a social demographic trend—it was
    not caused by the economy falling into a recession. Therefore, the
    influx of women into the work force increased the natural rate of
    unemployment.

3.  New entrants to the labor force, whether from college or otherwise,
    are counted as frictionally unemployed until they find a job.

1.  To compute the amount spent on each fruit in each year, you multiply
    the quantity of each fruit by the price.

    -   10 apples × 50 cents each = $5.00 spent on apples in 2001.

    -   12 bananas × 20 cents each = $2.40 spent on bananas in 2001.

    -   2 bunches of grapes at 65 cents each = $1.30 spent on grapes
        in 2001.

    -   1 pint of raspberries at $2 each = $2.00 spent on raspberries
        in 2001.

        Adding up the amounts gives you the total cost of the fruit
        basket. The total cost of the fruit basket in 2001 was $5.00

        \+ $2.40 + $1.30 + $2.00 = $10.70. The total costs for all the
        years are shown in the following table.

2.  If 2003 is the base year, then the index number has a value of 100
    in 2003. To transform the cost of a fruit basket each year, we
    divide each year’s value by $15.35, the value of the base year, and
    then multiply the result by 100. The price index is shown in the
    following table.

    Note that the base year has a value of 100; years before the base
    year have values less than 100; and years after have values more
    than 100.

3.  The inflation rate is calculated as the percentage change in the
    price index from year to year. For example, the inflation rate
    between 2001 and 2002 is (84.61 – 69.71) / 69.71 = 0.2137 = 21.37%.
    The inflation rates for all the years are shown in the last row of
    the following table, which includes the two previous answers.

    The rise in cost of living is calculated as the percentage increase:
    (2244 – 2120) / 2120 = 0.0585 = 5.85%.

5.  Since the CPI measures the prices of the goods and services
    purchased by the typical urban consumer, it measures the prices of
    things that people buy with their paycheck. For that reason, the CPI
    would be the best price index to use for this purpose.

6.  The PPI is subject to those biases for essentially the same reasons
    as the CPI is. The GDP deflator picks up prices of what is actually
    purchased that year, so there are no biases. That is the advantage
    of using the GDP deflator over the CPI.

7.  The calculator requires you to input three numbers:

    -   The first year, in this case the year of your birth

    -   The amount of money you would want to translate in terms of its
        purchasing power

    -   The last year—now or the most recent year the calculator will
        accept

        My birth year is 1955. The amount is $1. The year 2012 is
        currently the latest year the calculator will accept. The simple
        purchasing power calculator shows that $1 of purchases in 1955
        would cost $8.57 in 2012. The website also explains how the true
        answer is more complicated than that shown by the simple
        purchasing power calculator.

8.  The state government would benefit because it would repay the loan
    in less valuable dollars than it borrowed. Plus, tax revenues for
    the state government would increase because of the inflation.

9.  Higher inflation reduces real interest rates on fixed rate
    mortgages. Because ARMs can be adjusted, higher inflation

      

    leads to higher interest rates on ARMs.

10. Because the mortgage has an adjustable rate, the rate should fall by
    3%, the same as inflation, to keep the real interest rate the same.

1.  The stock and bond values will not show up in the current account.
    However, the dividends from the stocks and the interest from the
    bonds show up as an import to income in the current account.

2.  It becomes more negative as imports, which are a negative to the
    current account, are growing faster than exports, which are a
    positive.

1.  GDP is a dollar value of all production of goods and services.
    Exports are produced domestically but shipped abroad. The percent
    ratio of exports to GDP gives us an idea of how important exports
    are to the national economy out of all goods and services produced.
    For example, exports represent only 14% of U.S. GDP, but 50% of
    Germany’s GDP

2.  Divide $542 billion by $1,800 billion.

3.  Divide –$400 billion by $16,800 billion.

4.  The trade balance is the difference between exports and imports. The
    current account balance includes this number (whether it is a trade
    balance or a trade surplus), but also includes international flows
    of money from global investments.

    <span
    style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Liberation Serif&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; font-size: 9pt;">8</span>.

    1.  An export sale to Germany involves a financial flow from Germany
        to the U.S. economy.

    2.  The issue here is not U.S. investments in Brazil, but the return
        paid on those investments, which involves a financial flow from
        the Brazilian economy to the U.S. economy.

    3.  Foreign aid from the United States to Egypt is a financial flow
        from the United States to Egypt.

    4.  Importing oil from the Russian Federation means a flow of
        financial payments from the U.S. economy to the Russian
        Federation.

    5.  Japanese investors buying U.S. real estate is a financial flow
        from Japan to the U.S. economy.

<!-- -->

1.  The top portion tracks the flow of exports and imports and the
    payments for those. The bottom portion is looking at international
    financial investments and the outflow and inflow of monies from
    those investments. These investments can include investments in
    stocks and bonds or real estate abroad, as well as international
    borrowing and lending.

2.  If more monies are flowing out of the country (for example, to pay
    for imports) it will make the current account more negative or less
    positive, and if more monies are flowing into the country, it will
    make the current account less negative or more positive.

3.  Write out the national savings and investment identity for the
    situation of the economy implied by this question:

    Supply of capital = Demand for capital

    S + (M – X) + (T – G) = I

    Savings + (trade deficit) + (government budget surplus) = Investment

    If domestic savings increases and

    nothing else changes, then the trade deficit will fall. In effect,
    the economy would be relying more on domestic capital and less on
    foreign capital. If the government starts borrowing instead of
    saving, then the trade deficit must rise. In effect, the government
    is no longer providing savings and so, if nothing else is to change,
    more investment funds must arrive from abroad. If the rate of
    domestic investment surges, then, *ceteris paribus*, the trade
    deficit must also rise, to

      

    provide the extra capital. The *ceteris paribus*—or “other things
    being equal”—assumption is important here. In all of these
    situations, there is no reason to expect in the real world that the
    original change will affect only, or primarily, the trade deficit.
    The identity only says that something will adjust—it does not
    specify what.

4.  The government is saving rather than borrowing. The supply of
    savings, whether private or public, is on the left side of the
    identity.

5.  A trade deficit is determined by a country’s level of private and
    public savings and the amount of domestic investment.

6.  The trade deficit must increase. To put it another way, this
    increase in investment must be financed by an inflow of financial
    capital from abroad.

7.  Incomes fall during a recession, and consumers buy fewer good,
    including imports.

8.  A booming economy will increase the demand for goods in general, so
    import sales will increase. If our trading partners’ economies are
    doing well, they will buy more of our products and so U.S. exports
    will increase.

    style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Liberation Serif&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; font-size: 9pt;">17</span>.

    1.  Increased federal spending on Medicare may not increase
        productivity, so a budget deficit is not justified.

    2.  Increased spending on education will increase productivity and
        foster greater economic growth, so a budget deficit is
        justified.

    3.  Increased spending on the space program may not increase
        productivity, so a budget deficit is not justified.

    4.  Increased spending on airports and air traffic control will
        increase productivity and foster greater economic growth, so a
        budget deficit is justified.

10. Foreign investors worried about repayment so they began to pull
    money out of these countries. The money can be pulled out of stock
    and bond markets, real estate, and banks.

11. A rapidly growing trade surplus could result from a number of
    factors, so you would not want to be too quick to assume a specific
    cause. However, if the choice is between whether the economy is in
    recession or growing rapidly, the answer would have to be recession.
    In a recession, demand for all goods, including imports, has
    declined; however, demand for exports from other countries has not
    necessarily altered much, so the result is a larger trade surplus.

12. Germany has a higher level of trade than the United States. The
    United States has a large domestic economy so it has a large volume
    of internal trade.

13. <span
    style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Liberation Serif&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; font-size: 9pt;">21</span>.

    1.  A large economy tends to have lower levels of international
        trade, because it can do more of its trade internally, but this
        has little impact on its trade imbalance.

    2.  An imbalance between domestic physical investment and domestic
        saving (including government and private saving) will always
        lead to a trade imbalance, but has little to do with the level
        of trade.

    3.  Many large trading partners nearby geographically increases the
        level of trade, but has little impact one way or the other on a
        trade imbalance.

    4.  The answer here is not obvious. An especially large budget
        deficit means a large demand for financial capital which,
        according to the national saving and investment identity, makes
        it somewhat more likely that there will be a need for an inflow
        of foreign capital, which means a trade deficit.

    5.  A strong tradition of discouraging trade certainly reduces the
        level of trade. However, it does not necessarily say much about
        the balance of trade, since this is determined by both imports
        and exports, and by national levels of physical investment and
        savings.

  

<span id="bookmark1836">Chapter 11</span>

1.  In order to supply goods, suppliers must employ workers, whose
    incomes increase as a result of their labor. They use this
    additional income to demand goods of an equivalent value to those
    they supply.

      

2.  When consumers demand more goods than are available on the market,
    prices are driven higher and the additional opportunities for profit
    induce more suppliers to enter the market, producing an equivalent
    amount to that which is demanded.

3.  Higher input prices make output less profitable, decreasing the
    desired supply. This is shown graphically as a leftward shift in the
    AS curve.

4.  Equilibrium occurs at the level of GDP where AD = AS. Insufficient
    aggregate demand could explain why the equilibrium occurs at a level
    of GDP less than potential. A decrease (or leftward shift) in
    aggregate supply could be another reason.

5.  Immigration reform as described should increase the labor supply,
    shifting SRAS to the right, leading to a higher equilibrium GDP and
    a lower price level.

6.  Given the assumptions made here, the cuts in R&D funding should
    reduce productivity growth. The model would show this as a leftward
    shift in the SRAS curve, leading to a lower equilibrium GDP and a
    higher price level.

7.  An increase in the value of the stock market would make individuals
    feel wealthier and thus more confident about their economic
    situation. This would likely cause an increase in consumer
    confidence leading to an increase in consumer spending, shifting the
    AD curve to the right. The result would be an increase in the
    equilibrium level of GDP and an increase in the price level.

8.  Since imports depend on GDP, if Mexico goes into recession, its GDP
    declines and so do its imports. This decline in our exports can be
    shown as a leftward shift in AD, leading to a decrease in our GDP
    and price level.

9.  Tax cuts increase consumer and investment spending, depending on
    where the tax cuts are targeted. This would shift AD to the right,
    so if the tax cuts occurred when the economy was in recession (and
    GDP was less than potential), the tax cuts would increase GDP and
    “lead the economy out of recession.”

10. A negative report on home prices would make consumers feel like the
    value of their homes, which for most Americans is a major portion of
    their wealth, has declined. A negative report on consumer confidence
    would make consumers feel pessimistic about the future. Both of
    these would likely reduce consumer spending, shifting AD to the
    left, reducing GDP and the price level. A positive report on the
    home price index or consumer confidence would do the opposite.

11. A smaller labor force would be reflected in a leftward shift in AS,
    leading to a lower equilibrium level of GDP and higher price level.

12. Higher EU growth would increase demand for U.S. exports, reducing
    our trade deficit. The increased demand for exports would show up as
    a rightward shift in AD, causing GDP to rise (and the price level to
    rise as well). Higher GDP would require more jobs to fulfill, so
    U.S. employment would also rise.

13. Expansionary monetary policy shifts AD to the right. A continuing
    expansionary policy would cause larger and larger shifts (given the
    parameters of this problem). The result would be an increase in GDP
    and employment (a decrease in unemployment) and higher prices until
    potential output was reached. After that point, the expansionary
    policy would simply cause inflation.

14. Since the SRAS curve is vertical in the neoclassical zone, unless
    the economy is bordering the intermediate zone, a decrease in AS
    will cause a decrease in the price level, but no effect on real
    economic activity (for example, real GDP or employment).

15. Because the SRAS curve is horizontal in the Keynesian zone, a
    decrease in AD should depress real economic activity but have no
    effect on prices.

    1.  An increase in home values will increase consumption spending
        (due to increased wealth). AD will shift to the right and may
        cause inflation if it goes beyond potential GDP.

    2.  Rapid growth by a major trading partner will increase demand for
        exports. AD will shift to the right and may cause inflation if
        it goes beyond potential GDP.

    3.  Increased profit opportunities will increase business
        investment. AD will shift to the right and may cause inflation
        if it goes beyond potential GDP.

    4.  Higher interest rates reduce investment spending. AD will shift
        to the left and may cause recession if it falls below potential
        GDP.

    5.  Demand for cheaper imports increases, reducing demand for
        domestic products. AD will shift to the left and may be
        recessionary.

<span
style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Liberation Serif&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; font-size: 9pt;">2</span>.

1.  A tax increase on consumer income will cause consumption to fall,
    pushing the AD curve left, and is a possible solution to inflation.

2.  A surge in military spending is an increase in government spending.
    This will cause the AD curve to shift to the right. If real GDP is
    less than potential GDP, then this spending would pull the economy
    out of a recession. If real GDP is to the right of potential GDP,
    then the AD curve will shift farther to the right and military
    spending will be inflationary.

3.  A tax cut focused on business investment will shift AD to the right.
    If the original macroeconomic equilibrium is below potential GDP,
    then this policy can help move an economy out of a recession.

4.  Government spending on healthcare will cause the AD curve to shift
    to the right. If real GDP is less than potential GDP, then this
    spending would pull the economy out of a recession. If real GDP is
    to th right of potential GDP, then the AD curve will shift farther
    to the right and healthcare spending will be inflationary.

<!-- -->

1.  An inflationary gap is the result of an increase in aggregate demand
    when the economy is at potential output. Since the AS curve is
    vertical at potential GDP, any increase in AD will lead to a higher
    price level (i.e. inflation) but no higher real GDP. This is easy to
    see if you draw AD<span class="s60">1</span> to the right of AD<span
    class="s60">0</span>.

2.  A decrease in government spending will shift AD to the left.

3.  A decrease in energy prices, a positive supply shock, would cause
    the AS curve to shift out to the right, yielding more real GDP at a
    lower price level. This would shift the Phillips curve down toward
    the origin, meaning the economy would experience lower unemployment
    and a lower rate of inflation.

4.  Keynesian economics does not require microeconomic price controls of
    any sort. It is true that many Keynesian economic prescriptions were
    for the government to influence the total amount of aggregate demand
    in the economy, often through government spending and tax cuts.

5.  The three problems center on government’s ability to estimate
    potential GDP, decide whether to influence aggregate demand through
    tax changes or changes in government spending, and the lag time that
    occurs as Congress and the President attempt to pass legislation.

  

<span id="bookmark1838">Chapter 13</span>

1.  No, this statement is false. It would be more accurate to say that
    rational expectations seek to predict the future as accurately as
    possible, using all of past experience as a guide. Adaptive
    expectations are largely backward looking; that is, they adapt as
    experience accumulates, but without attempting to look forward.

2.  An unemployment rate of zero percent is presumably well below the
    rate that is consistent with potential GDP and with the natural rate
    of unemployment. As a result, this policy would be attempting to
    push AD out to the right. In the short run, it is possible to have
    unemployment slightly below the natural rate for a time, at a price
    of higher inflation, as shown by the movement from E<span
    class="s60">0</span> to E<span class="s60">1</span> along the
    short-run AS curve. However, over time the extremely low
    unemployment rates will tend to cause wages to be bid up, and shift
    the short-run AS curve back to the left. The result would be a
    higher price level, but an economy still at potential GDP and the
    natural rate of unemployment, as determined by the long-run AS
    curve. If the government continues this policy, it will continually
    be pushing the price

      

    level higher and higher, but it will not be able to achieve its goal
    of zero percent unemployment, because that goal is inconsistent with
    market forces.

3.  The statement is accurate. Rational expectations can be thought of
    as a version of neoclassical economics because it argues that
    potential GDP and the rate of unemployment are shaped by market
    forces as wages and prices adjust. However, it is an “extreme”
    version because it argues that this adjustment takes place very
    quickly. Other theories, like adaptive expectations, suggest that
    adjustment to the neoclassical outcome takes a few years.

4.  The short-term Keynesian model is built on the importance of
    aggregate demand as a cause of business cycles and a degree of wage
    and price rigidity, and thus does a sound job of explaining many
    recessions and why cyclical unemployment rises and falls. The
    neoclassical model emphasizes aggregate supply by focusing on the
    underlying determinants of output and employment in markets, and
    thus tends to put more emphasis on economic growth and how labor
    markets work.

1.  As long as you remain within the walls of the casino, chips fit the
    definition of money; that is, they serve as a medium of exchange, a
    unit of account, and a store of value. Chips do not work very well
    as money once you leave the casino, but many kinds of money do not
    work well in other areas. For example, it is hard to spend money
    from Turkey or Brazil at your local supermarket or at the movie
    theater.

2.  Many physical items that a person buys at one time but may sell at
    another time can serve as an answer to this question. Examples
    include a house, land, art, rare coins or stamps, and so on.

3.  The currency and checks in M1 are easiest to spend. It is harder to
    spend M2 directly, although if there is an automatic teller machine
    in the shopping mall, you can turn M2 from your savings account into
    an M1 of currency quite quickly. If your answer is about “credit
    cards,” then you are really talking about spending M1—although it is
    M1 from the account of the credit card company, which you will repay
    later when you credit card bill comes due.

1.  A bank’s assets include cash held in their vaults, but assets also
    include monies that the bank holds at the Federal Reserve Bank
    (called “reserves”), loans that are made to customers, and bonds.

    style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Liberation Serif&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; font-size: 9pt;">6</span>.

    1.  A borrower who has been late on a number of loan payments looks
        perhaps less likely to repay the loan, or to repay it on time,
        and so you would want to pay less for that loan.

    2.  If interest rates generally have risen, then this loan made at a
        time of relatively lower interest rates looks less attractive,
        and you would pay less for it.

    3.  If the borrower is a firm with a record of high profits, then it
        is likely to be able to repay the loan, and you would be willing
        to pay more for the loan.

    4.  If interest rates in the economy have fallen, then the loan is
        worth more.

  

<span id="bookmark1840">Chapter 15</span>

1.  Longer terms insulate the Board from political forces. Since the
    presidency can potentially change every four years, the Federal
    Reserve’s independence prevents drastic swings in monetary policy
    with every new administration and allows policy decisions to be made
    only on economic grounds.

2.  Banks make their money from issuing loans and charging interest. The
    more money that is stored in the bank’s vault, the less is available
    for lending and the less money the bank stands to make.

      

3.  The fear and uncertainty created by the suggestion that a bank might
    fail can lead depositors to withdraw their money. If many depositors
    do this at the same time, the bank may not be able to meet their
    demands and will, indeed, fail.

4.  The bank has to hold $1,000 in reserves, so when it buys the $500 in
    bonds, it will have to reduce its loans by $500 to make up the
    difference. The money supply decreases by the same amount.

5.  An increase in reserve requirements would reduce the supply of
    money, since more money would be held in banks rather than
    circulating in the economy.

6.  Contractionary policy reduces the amount of loanable funds in the
    economy. As with all goods, greater scarcity leads a greater price,
    so the interest rate, or the price of borrowing money, rises.

7.  An increase in the amount of available loanable funds means that
    there are more people who want to lend. They, therefore, bid the
    price of borrowing (the interest rate) down.

8.  In times of economic uncertainty, banks may worry that borrowers
    will lose the ability to repay their loans. They may also fear that
    a panic is more likely and they will need the excess reserves to
    meet their obligations.

9.  If consumer optimism changes, spending can speed up or slow down.
    This could also happen in a case where consumers need to buy a large
    number of items quickly, such as in a situation of national
    emergency.

    1.  The British use the pound sterling, while Germans use the euro,
        so a British exporter will receive euros from export sales,
        which will need to be exchanged for pounds. A stronger euro will
        mean more pounds per euro, so the exporter will be better off.
        In addition, the lower price for German imports will stimulate
        demand for British exports. For both these reasons, a stronger
        euro benefits the British exporter.

    2.  The Dutch use euros while the Chileans use pesos, so the Dutch
        tourist needs to turn euros into Chilean pesos. An increase in
        the euro means that the tourist will get more pesos per euro. As
        a consequence, the Dutch tourist will have a less expensive
        vacation than he planned, so the tourist will be better off.

    3.  The Greek use euros while the Canadians use dollars. An increase
        in the euro means it will buy more Canadian dollars. As a
        result, the Greek bank will see a decrease in the cost of the
        Canadian bonds, so it may purchase more bonds. Either way, the
        Greek bank benefits.

    4.  Since both the French and Germans use the euro, an increase in
        the euro, in terms of other currencies, should have no impact on
        the French exporter.

<!-- -->

1.  Expected depreciation in a currency will lead people to divest
    themselves of the currency. We should expect to see an increase in
    the supply of pounds and a decrease in demand for pounds. The result
    should be a decrease in the value of the pound *vis à vis* the
    dollar.

2.  Lower U.S. interest rates make U.S. assets less desirable compared
    to assets in the European Union. We should expect to see a decrease
    in demand for dollars and an increase in supply of dollars in
    foreign currency markets. As a result, we should expect to see the
    dollar depreciate compared to the euro.

3.  A decrease in Argentine inflation relative to other countries should
    cause an increase in demand for pesos, a decrease in supply of
    pesos, and an appreciation of the peso in foreign currency markets.

4.  The problem occurs when banks borrow foreign currency but lend in
    domestic currency. Since banks’ assets (loans they made) are in
    domestic currency, while their debts (money they borrowed) are in
    foreign currency, when the domestic currency declines, their debts
    grow larger. If the domestic currency falls substantially in value,
    as happened during the Asian financial crisis, then the banking
    system could fail. This problem is unlikely to occur for U.S. banks
    because, even when they borrow from abroad, they tend to borrow
    dollars. Remember, there are trillions of dollars in circulation in
    the global economy. Since both assets and debts are in dollars, a
    change in the value of the dollar does not cause banking system
    failure the way it can when banks borrow in foreign currency.

      

5.  While capital flight is possible in either case, if a country
    borrows to invest in real capital it is more likely to be able to
    generate the income to pay back its debts than a country that
    borrows to finance consumption. As a result, an
    investment-stimulated economy is less likely to provoke capital
    flight and economic recession.

6.  A contractionary monetary policy, by driving up domestic interest
    rates, would cause the currency to appreciate. The higher value of
    the currency in foreign exchange markets would reduce exports, since
    from the perspective of foreign buyers, they are now more expensive.
    The higher value of the currency would similarly stimulate imports,
    since they would now be cheaper from the perspective of domestic
    buyers. Lower exports and higher imports cause net exports (EX – IM)
    to fall, which causes aggregate demand to fall. The result would be
    a decrease in GDP working through the exchange rate mechanism
    reinforcing the effect contractionary monetary policy has on
    domestic investment expenditure. However, cheaper imports would
    stimulate aggregate supply, bringing GDP back to potential, though
    at a lower price level.

7.  For a currency to fall, a central bank need only supply more of its
    currency in foreign exchange markets. It can print as much domestic
    currency as it likes. For a currency to rise, a central bank needs
    to buy its currency in foreign exchange markets, paying with foreign
    currency. Since no central bank has an infinite amount of foreign
    currency reserves, it cannot buy its currency indefinitely.

8.  Variations in exchange rates, because they change import and export
    prices, disturb international trade flows. When trade is a large
    part of a nation’s economic activity, government will find it more
    advantageous to fix exchange rates to minimize disruptions of trade
    flows.

  

<span id="bookmark1842">Chapter 17</span>

1.  The government borrows funds by selling Treasury bonds, notes, and
    bills.

2.  The funds can be used to pay down the national debt or else be
    refunded to the taxpayers.

3.  Yes, a nation can run budget deficits and see its debt/GDP ratio
    fall. In fact, this is not uncommon. If the deficit is small in a
    given year, than the addition to debt in the numerator of the
    debt/GDP ratio will be relatively small, while the growth in GDP is
    larger, and so the debt/GDP ratio declines. This was the experience
    of the U.S. economy for the period from the end of World War II to
    about 1980. It is also theoretically possible, although not likely,
    for a nation to have a budget surplus and see its debt/GDP ratio
    rise. Imagine the case of a nation with a small surplus, but in a
    recession year when the economy shrinks. It is possible that the
    decline in the nation’s debt, in the numerator of the debt/GDP
    ratio, would be proportionally less than the fall in the size of
    GDP, so the debt/GDP ratio would rise.

4.  Progressive. People who give larger gifts subject to the higher tax
    rate would typically have larger incomes as well.

5.  Corporate income tax on his profits, individual income tax on his
    salary, and payroll tax taken out of the wages he pays himself.

6.  individual income taxes

7.  The tax is regressive because wealthy income earners are not taxed
    at all on income above $113,000. As a percent of total income, the
    social security tax hits lower income earners harder than wealthier
    individuals.

8.  As debt increases, interest payments also rise, so that the deficit
    grows even if we keep other government spending constant.

<!-- -->

1.  To keep prices from rising too much or too rapidly.

2.  To increase employment.

3.  It falls below because less tax revenue than expected is collected.

4.  Automatic stabilizers take effect very quickly, whereas
    discretionary policy can take a long time to implement.

5.  In a recession, because of the decline in economic output, less
    income is earned, and so less in taxes is automatically collected.
    Many welfare and unemployment programs are designed so that those
    who fall into certain categories, like “unemployed” or “low income,”
    are eligible for benefits. During a recession, more people fall into
    these categories and become eligible for benefits automatically. The
    combination of reduced taxes and higher spending is just what is
    needed for an economy in recession producing below potential GDP.
    With an economic boom, average income levels rise in the economy, so
    more in taxes is automatically collected. Fewer people meet the
    criteria for receiving government assistance to the unemployed or
    the needy, so government spending on unemployment assistance and
    welfare falls automatically. This combination of higher taxes and
    lower spending is just what is needed if an economy is producing
    above its potential GDP.

6.  Prices would be pushed up as a result of too much spending.

7.  Employment would suffer as a result of too little spending.

8.  Monetary policy probably has shorter time lags than fiscal policy.
    Imagine that the data becomes fairly clear that an economy is in or
    near a recession. Expansionary monetary policy can be carried out
    through open market operations, which can be done fairly quickly,
    since the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee meets six times a
    year. Also, monetary policy takes effect through interest rates,
    which can change fairly quickly. However, fiscal policy is carried
    out through acts of Congress that need to be signed into law by the
    president. Negotiating such laws often takes months, and even after
    the laws are negotiated, it takes more months for spending programs
    or tax cuts to have an effect on the macroeconomy.

9.  The government would have to make up the revenue either by raising
    taxes in a different area or cutting spending.

10. Programs where the amount of spending is not fixed, but rather
    determined by macroeconomic conditions, such as food stamps, would
    lose a great deal of flexibility if spending increases had to be met
    by corresponding tax increases or spending cuts.

1.  We use the national savings and investment identity to solve this
    question. In this case, the government has a budget surplus, so the
    government surplus appears as part of the supply of financial
    capital. Then:

    Quantity supplied of financial capital = Quantity demanded of
    financial capital

    S + (T – G) = I + (X – M) 600 + 200 = I + 100

    I = 700

      

    <span
    style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Liberation Serif&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; font-size: 9pt;">2</span>.

    1.  Since the government has a budget surplus, the government budget
        term appears with the supply of capital. The following shows the
        national savings and investment identity for this economy. <span
        class="s16">Quantity supplied of financial capital = Quantity
        demanded of financial capital</span>

        S + (T – G) = I + (X – M)

          

    2.  Plugging the given values into the identity shown in part (a),
        we find that (X – M) = 0.

    3.  Since the government has a budget deficit, the government budget
        term appears with the demand for capital. You do not know in
        advance whether the economy has a trade deficit or a trade
        surplus. But when you see that the quantity demanded of
        financial capital exceeds the quantity supplied, you know that
        there must be an additional quantity of financial capital
        supplied by foreign investors, which means a trade deficit
        of 2000. This example shows that in this case there is a higher
        budget deficit, and a higher trade deficit. <span
        class="s16">Quantity supplied of financial capital = Quantity
        demanded of financial capital</span>

S + (M – X) = I + (G – T) 4000 + 2000 = 5000 + 1000

1.  In this case, the national saving and investment identity is written
    in this way:

    Quantity supplied of financial capital = Quantity demanded of
    financial capital (T – G) + (M – X) + S = I

    The increase in the government budget surplus and the increase in
    the trade deficit both increased the supply of financial capital. If
    investment in physical capital remained unchanged, then private
    savings must go down, and if savings remained unchanged, then
    investment must go up. In fact, both effects happened; that is, in
    the late 1990s, in the U.S. economy, savings declined and investment
    rose.

2.  Ricardian equivalence means that private saving changes to offset
    exactly any changes in the government budget. So, if the deficit
    increases by 20, private saving increases by 20 as well, and the
    trade deficit and the budget deficit will not change from their
    original levels. The original national saving and investment
    identity is written below. Notice that if any change in the (G – T)
    term is offset by a change in the S term, then the other terms do
    not change. So if (G

    – T) rises by 20, then S must also increase by 20.

    Quantity supplied of financial capital = Quantity demanded of
    financial capital

    S + (M – X) = I + (G – T) 130 + 20 = 100 + 50

3.  In the last few decades, spending per student has climbed
    substantially. However, test scores have fallen over this time. This
    experience has led a number of experts to argue that the problem is
    not resources—or is not just resources by itself—but is also a
    problem of how schools are organized and managed and what incentives
    they have for success. There are a number of proposals to alter the
    incentives that schools face, but relatively little hard evidence on
    what proposals work well. Without trying to evaluate whether these
    proposals are good or bad ideas, you can just list some of them:
    testing students regularly; rewarding teachers or schools that
    perform well on such tests; requiring additional teacher training;
    allowing students to choose between public schools; allowing
    teachers and parents to start new schools; giving student “vouchers”
    that they can use to pay tuition at either public or private
    schools.

4.  The government can direct government spending to R&D. It can also
    create tax incentives for business to invest in R&D.

    East Asia appears to be the largest economy on GDP basis, but on a
    per capita basis it drops to third, after Europe and Central Asia
    and Sub-Saharan Africa.

2.  A region can have some of high-income countries and some of the
    low-income countries. Aggregating per capita real GDP will vary
    widely across countries within a region, so aggregating data for a
    region has little meaning. For example, if you were to compare per
    capital real GDP for the United States, Canada, Haiti, and Honduras,
    it looks much different than if you looked at the same data for
    North America as a whole. Thus, regional comparisons are broad-based
    and may not adequately capture an individual country’s economic
    attributes.

3.  The following table provides a summary of possible answers.

4.  Low-income countries must adopt government policies that are
    market-oriented and that educate the workforce and population. After
    this is done, low-income countries should focus on eradicating other
    social ills that inhibit their growth. The economically challenged
    are stuck in poverty traps. They need to focus more on health and
    education and create a stable macroeconomic and political
    environment. This will attract foreign aid and foreign investment.
    Middle-income countries strive for increases in physical capital and
    innovation, while higher-income countries must work to maintain
    their economies through innovation and technology.

5.  If there is a recession and unemployment increases, we can call on
    an expansionary fiscal policy (lower taxes or increased government
    spending) or an expansionary monetary policy (increase the money
    supply and lower interest rates). Both policies stimulate output and
    decrease unemployment.

6.  Aside from a high natural rate of unemployment due to government
    regulations, subsistence households may be counted as not working.

7.  Indexing wage contracts means wages rise when prices rise. This
    means what you can buy with your wages, your standard of living,
    remains the same. When wages are not indexed, or rise with
    inflation, your standard of living falls.

8.  An increase in government spending shifts the AD curve to the right,
    raising both income and price levels.

9.  A decrease in the money supply will shift the AD curve leftward and
    reduce income and price levels. Banks will have less money to lend.
    Interest rates will increase, affecting consumption and investment,
    which are both key determinants of aggregate demand.

10. Given the high level of activity in international financial markets,
    it is typically believed that financial flows across borders are the
    real reason for trade imbalances. For example, the United States had
    an enormous trade deficit in

      

    the late 1990s and early 2000s because it was attracting vast
    inflows of foreign capital. Smaller countries that have attracted
    such inflows of international capital worry that if the inflows
    suddenly turn to outflows, the resulting decline in their currency
    could collapse their banking system and bring on a deep recession.

11. The demand for the country’s currency would decrease, lowering the
    exchange rate.

1.  False. Anything that leads to different levels of productivity
    between two economies can be a source of comparative advantage. For
    example, the education of workers, the knowledge base of engineers
    and scientists in a country, the part of a split-up value chain
    where they have their specialized learning, economies of scale, and
    other factors can all determine comparative advantage.

2.  Brazil has the absolute advantage in producing beef and the United
    States has the absolute advantage in autos. The opportunity cost of
    producing one pound of beef is 1/10 of an auto; in the United States
    it is 3/4 of an auto.

3.  In answering questions like these, it is often helpful to begin by
    organizing the information in a table, such as in the following
    table. Notice that, in this case, the productivity of the countries
    is expressed in terms of how many workers it takes to produce a unit
    of a product.

    In this example, France has an absolute advantage in the production
    of both sweaters and wine. You can tell because it takes France less
    labor to produce a unit of the good.

    1.  In Germany, it takes fewer workers to make either a television
        or a video camera. Germany has an absolute advantage in the
        production of both goods.

    2.  Producing an additional television in Germany requires three
        workers. Shifting those three German workers will reduce video
        camera production by 3/4 of a camera. Producing an additional
        television set in Poland requires six workers, and shifting
        those workers from the other good reduces output of video
        cameras by 6/ 12 of a camera, or 1/2. Thus, the opportunity cost
        of producing televisions is lower in Poland, so Poland has the
        comparative advantage in the production of televisions. *Note*:
        Do not let the fractions like 3/4 of a camera or 1/2 of a video
        camera bother you. If either country was to expand television
        production by a significant amount—that is, lots more than one
        unit—then we will be talking about whole cameras and not
        fractional ones. You can also spot this conclusion by noticing
        that Poland’s absolute disadvantage is relatively lower in
        televisions, because Poland needs twice as many workers to
        produce a television but three times as many to produce a video
        camera, so the product with the relatively lower absolute
        disadvantage is Poland’s comparative advantage.

    3.  Producing a video camera in Germany requires four workers, and
        shifting those four workers away from television production has
        an opportunity cost of 4/3 television sets. Producing a video
        camera in Poland requires 12 workers, and shifting those 12
        workers away from television production has an opportunity cost
        of two television sets. Thus, the opportunity cost of producing
        video cameras is lower in Germany, and video cameras will be
        Germany’s comparative advantage.

    4.  In this example, absolute advantage differs from comparative
        advantage. Germany has the absolute advantage in the production
        of both goods, but Poland has a comparative advantage in the
        production of televisions.

    5.  Germany should specialize, at least to some extent, in the
        production of video cameras, export video cameras, and import
        televisions. Conversely, Poland should specialize, at least to
        some extent, in the production of televisions, export
        televisions, and import video cameras.

  

1.  There are a number of possible advantages of intra-industry trade.
    Both nations can take advantage of extreme specialization and
    learning in certain kinds of cars with certain traits, like
    gas-efficient cars, luxury cars, sport- utility vehicles, higher-
    and lower-quality cars, and so on. Moreover, nations can take
    advantage of economies of scale, so that large companies will
    compete against each other across international borders, providing
    the benefits of competition and variety to customers. This same
    argument applies to trade between U.S. states, where people often
    buy products made by people of other states, even though a similar
    product is made within the boundaries of their own state. All
    states—and all countries—can benefit from this kind of competition
    and trade.

    1.  Start by plotting the points on a sketch diagram and then
        drawing a line through them. The following figure illustrates
        the average costs of production of semiconductors.

          

        <img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_483.jpg" width="300" height="243" alt="image" />

          

          

        The curve illustrates economies of scale by showing that as the
        scale increases—that is, as production at this particular
        factory goes up—the average cost of production declines. The
        economies of scale exist up to an output of 40,000
        semiconductors; at higher outputs, the average cost of
        production does not seem to decline any further.

    2.  At any quantity demanded above 40,000, this economy can take
        full advantage of economies of scale; that is, it can produce at
        the lowest cost per unit. Indeed, if the quantity demanded was
        quite high, like 500,000, then there could be a number of
        different factories all taking full advantage of economies of
        scale and competing with each other. If the quantity demanded
        falls below 40,000, then the economy by itself, without foreign
        trade, cannot take full advantage of economies of scale.

    3.  The simplest answer to this question is that the small country
        could have a large enough factory to take full advantage of
        economies of scale, but then export most of the output. For
        semiconductors, countries like Taiwan and Korea have recently
        fit this description. Moreover, this country could also import
        semiconductors from other countries which also have large
        factories, thus getting the benefits of competition and variety.
        A slightly more complex answer is that the country can get these
        benefits of economies of scale without producing semiconductors,
        but simply by buying semiconductors made at low cost around the
        world. An economy, especially a smaller country, may well end up
        specializing and producing a few items on a large scale, but
        then trading those items for other items produced on a large
        scale, and thus gaining the benefits of economies of scale by
        trade, as well as by direct production.

<span class="p">A nation might restrict trade on imported products to
protect an industry that is important for national security. For
example, nation X and nation Y may be geopolitical rivals, each with
ambitions of increased political and economic strength. Even if nation Y
has comparative advantage in the production of missile defense systems,
it is unlikely that nation Y would seek to export those goods to nation
X. It is also the case that, for some nations, the production of a
particular good is a key component of national identity. In Japan, the
production of rice is culturally very important.</span>

  

It may be difficult for Japan to import rice from a nation like Vietnam,
even if Vietnam has a comparative advantage in rice production.

  

<span id="bookmark1846">Chapter 21</span>

1.  This is the opposite case of the Work It Out feature. A reduced
    tariff is like a decrease in the cost of production, which is shown
    by a downward (or rightward) shift in the supply curve.

2.  A subsidy is like a reduction in cost. This shifts the supply curve
    down (or to the right), driving the price of sugar down. If the
    subsidy is large enough, the price of sugar can fall below the cost
    of production faced by foreign producers, which means they will lose
    money on any sugar they produce and sell.

3.  Trade barriers raise the price of goods in protected industries. If
    those products are inputs in other industries, it raises their
    production costs and then prices, so sales fall in those other
    industries. Lower sales lead to lower employment. Additionally, if
    the protected industries are consumer goods, their customers pay
    higher prices, which reduce demand for other consumer products and
    thus employment in those industries.

4.  Trade based on comparative advantage raises the average wage rate
    economy-wide, though it can reduce the incomes of
    import-substituting industries. By moving away from a country’s
    comparative advantage, trade barriers do the opposite: they give
    workers in protected industries an advantage, while reducing the
    average wage economy- wide.

5.  By raising incomes, trade tends to raise working conditions also,
    even though those conditions may not (yet) be equivalent to those in
    high-income countries.

6.  They typically pay more than the next-best alternative. If a Nike
    firm did not pay workers at least as much as they would earn, for
    example, in a subsistence rural lifestyle, they many never come to
    work for Nike.

7.  Since trade barriers raise prices, real incomes fall. The average
    worker would also earn less.

8.  Workers working in other sectors and the protected sector see a
    decrease in their real wage.

9.  If imports can be sold at extremely low prices, domestic firms would
    have to match those prices to be competitive. By definition,
    matching prices would imply selling under cost and, therefore,
    losing money. Firms cannot sustain losses forever. When they leave
    the industry, importers can “take over,” raising prices to monopoly
    levels to cover their short-term losses and earn long-term profits.

10. Because low-income countries need to provide necessities—food,
    clothing, and shelter—to their people. In other words, they consider
    environmental quality a luxury.

11. Low-income countries can compete for jobs by reducing their
    environmental standards to attract business to their countries. This
    could lead to a competitive reduction in regulations, which would
    lead to greater environmental damage. While pollution management is
    a cost for businesses, it is tiny relative to other costs, like
    labor and adequate infrastructure. It is also costly for firms to
    locate far away from their customers, which many low-income
    countries are.

12. The decision should not be arbitrary or unnecessarily
    discriminatory. It should treat foreign companies the same way as
    domestic companies. It should be based on science.

13. Restricting imports today does not solve the problem. If anything,
    it makes it worse since it implies using up domestic sources of the
    products faster than if they are imported. Also, the national
    security argument can be used to support protection of nearly any
    product, not just things critical to our national security.

14. The effect of increasing standards may increase costs to the small
    exporting country. The supply curve of toys will shift to the left.
    Exports will decrease and toy prices will rise. Tariffs also raise
    prices. So the effect on the price of toys is the same. A tariff is
    a “second best” policy and also affects other sectors. However, a
    common standard across countries is a “first best” policy that
    attacks the problem at its root.

      

15. A free trade association offers free trade between its members, but
    each country can determine its own trade policy outside the
    association. A common market requires a common external trade policy
    in addition to free trade within the group. An economic union is a
    common market with coordinated fiscal and monetary policy.

16. International agreements can serve as a political counterweight to
    domestic special interests, thereby preventing stronger
    protectionist measures.

17. Reductions in tariffs, quotas, and other trade barriers, improved
    transportation, and communication media have made people more aware
    of what is available in the rest of the world.

18. Competition from firms with better or cheaper products can reduce a
    business’s profits, and may drive it out of business. Workers would
    similarly lose income or even their jobs.

19. Consumers get better or less expensive products. Businesses with the
    better or cheaper products increase their profits. Employees of
    those businesses earn more income. On balance, the gains outweigh
    the losses to a nation.

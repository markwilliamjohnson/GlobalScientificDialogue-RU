# Introduction to the Workshop

## Why Digitalization?
Barely a day goes by without someone mentioning the rapid advances in the way the internet is shaping our lives.  From the miraculous achievements of Articial Intelligence to the political problems produced by social media, the 'digital' is becoming increasingly important. 

It is often said that the jobs of tomorrow don't exist yet. But there are indications as to the kinds of skills that are increasingly important in industry: 
1. Skills in making sense from complex data
2. SKills in presenting and visualising data
3. Skills in developing new kinds of application
4. Skill in communicating between highly technical levels and deeply human

In many cases and in many courses across the University, some of these skills are being taught. But it can be supported better, and it can be coordinated and developed more effectively.

For this reason, these workshops are designed to identify:
1. What aspects of digitalisation already exist in the departments?
2. What would digitalisation change about the humanities?
3. How do humanities professors define digitalisation?
4. What role do professors see for themselves within the digitisation initiative?

15 min	activity	digitalisation in your courses
15 min	discussion	sharing pedagogical approaches (community building)

## Activities
What is digitalisation


### activities
participants write down their definition of digitalisation
the definitions are compiled (model the use of text processing libraries)
discuss the overlap, differences, and themes among the responses
extension: if time and interest allow, the groups definitions could be compared to existing ones in the literature, university, or online
## objectives
participants reflect on their own understanding of what digitalisation is
model using text analysis to identify core ideas that constitute digitalisation (set up discussion of the uses and limitations of text analysis)
#### build a working model of digitalisation that is relevant and field specific

## how fields change
activity—questions presented during the lecture culminating in discussion
best case scenario, how would your field change in the next 10 years
collect responses and identify the most extreme or contentious
have participants rank their top ones
discuss if they are aligned or misaligned with technological changes
optional: have groups split into same-field groups and analyse a different fields future vision
## objectives
hold attention
invite discussion and input from attendee
collect data from the participants

## digitalisation in your courses
activities
outline a specific change for an existing course
share across the group (or in small groups) to explore similarities and suggest ideas
use the proposed course changes to discuss deeper issues invited by digitalisation:
depth: surface / core
type: content / methods / epistemology
implications: disciplinary bounds, curriculum alignment
## objectives
design a way that current courses could be modified
evaluate changes of proposed objectives
optional: provide examples to stimulate discussion, groups can rank the relevance for their courses and discuss specific activities in groups
## Lectures
overview of the 2023 initiative
position the department within the overall initiative
present the “key actors” and goals of the initiative

how fields change
introduce the concept of surface versus core transformation (visual models)
propose that meaningful change requires content and practice changes
discuss how desired changes are afforded or hindered by digitalisation

Introduction to Computational Thinking in Law
=============================================

In this book, you will learn some of the key techniques and tricks of using data in the Law curriculum.

Here's a little video to explain:

# How to embed your video in a Jupyter book
## Step 1: get the share code from youtube

Once you've got the share code from youtube, you can type:

```python
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hayg99JKM60" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
```

# This is an interesting thing here:

if you type a cell in a markdown file, you can still run it...

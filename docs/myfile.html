<p><span id="bookmark3">About</span> <em>Principles of Macroeconomics 2e</em></p>
<p>Principles of Macroeconomics 2e <span class="p">(2nd edition) covers the
scope and sequence requirements of most introductory macroeconomics
courses. The text includes many current examples, which are handled in a
politically equitable way. The outcome is a balanced approach to both
Keynesian and classical views, and to the theory and application of
economics concepts. The second edition has been thoroughly revised to
increase clarity, update data and current event impacts, and incorporate
the feedback from many reviewers and adopters.</span></p>
<p>Coverage and scope</p>
<p>To develop the first edition of <em>Principles of Macroeconomics</em>, we
acquired the rights to Timothy Taylor’s <em>Principles of Economics</em> and
solicited ideas from economics instructors at all levels of higher
education, from community colleges to PhD-granting universities. For the
second edition, we received even more expansive and actionable feedback
from hundreds of adopters who had used the book for several academic
terms. These knowledgeable instructors informed the pedagogical courses,
learning objective development and fulfillment, and the chapter
arrangements. Faculty who taught from the material provided critical and
detailed commentary.</p>
<p>The result is a book that covers the breadth of economics topics and
also provides the necessary depth to ensure the course is manageable for
instructors and students alike. We strove to balance theory and
application, as well as the amount of calculation and mathematical
examples.</p>
<p>The book is organized into seven main parts:</p>
<p>What is Economics? <span class="p">The first two chapters introduce
students to the study of economics with a focus on making choices in a
world of scarce resources.</span></p>
<p>Supply and Demand<span class="p">, Chapters 3 and 4, introduces and
explains the first analytical model in economics: supply, demand, and
equilibrium, before showing applications in the markets for labor and
finance.</span></p>
<p>Elasticity and Price<span class="p">, Chapter 5, introduces and explains
elasticity and price, two key concepts in economics.</span></p>
<p>The Macroeconomic Perspective and Goals<span class="p">, Chapters 6
through 10, introduces a number of key concepts in macro: economic
growth, unemployment and inflation, and international trade and capital
flows.</span></p>
<p>A Framework for Macroeconomic Analysis<span class="p">, Chapters 11
through 13, introduces the principal analytic model in macro, namely the
aggregate demand/aggregate supply Model. The model is then applied to
the Keynesian and Neoclassical perspectives. The expenditure-output
model is fully explained in a stand-alone appendix.</span></p>
<p>Monetary and Fiscal Policy<span class="p">, Chapters 14 through 18,
explains the role of money and the banking system, as well as monetary
policy and financial regulation. Then the discussion switches to
government deficits and fiscal policy.</span></p>
<p>International Economics<span class="p">, Chapters 19 through 21, the
final part of the text, introduces the international dimensions of
economics, including international trade and protectionism.</span></p>
<p>Alternate Sequencing</p>
<p>Principles of Macroeconomics 2e <span class="p">was conceived and
written to fit a particular topical sequence, but it can be used
flexibly to accommodate other course structures. One such potential
structure, which will fit reasonably well with the textbook content, is
provided below. Please consider, however, that the chapters were not
written to be completely independent, and that the proposed alternate
sequence should be carefully considered for student preparation and
textual consistency.</span></p>

Chapter 3 Demand and Supply</p>
<p>Chapter 4 Labor and Financial Markets Chapter 5 Elasticity</p>

<p>Changes to the second edition</p>
<p>OpenStax only undertakes revisions when significant modifications to a
text are necessary. In the case of <em>Principles of Macroeconomics</em>, we
received a wealth of constructive feedback. Many of the book’s users
felt that consequential movement in economic data, coupled with the
impacts of national and global events, warranted a full revision. We
also took advantage of the opportunity to improve the writing and
sequencing of the text, as well as many of the calculation examples. The
major changes are summarized below.</p>
<p>Augmented explanations in chapters one through four provide a more
comprehensive and informative foundation for the book.</p>
<p>A clearer explanation, using a numerical example, has been given for
finding the utility maximizing combination of goods and services a
consumer should choose.</p>
<p>The Theory of Production has been added to the chapter on costs &amp;
industry structure.</p>
<p>A more complete treatment has been given to labor markets, including the
theories of competitive and monopsonistic labor markets, and bilateral
monopoly; and the labor markets chapter and the poverty and economic
inequality chapter have been resequenced.</p>
<p>Substantial revisions to the AD/AS model in chapters 11-13 present the
core concepts of macroeconomics in a clearer, more dynamic manner.</p>
<p>Case studies and examples have been revised and, in some cases, replaced
to provide more relevant and useful information for students.</p>
<p>Economic data, tables, and graphs, as well as discussion and analysis
around that data, have been thoroughly updated.</p>
<p>Wherever possible, data from the Federal Reserve Economic Database
(FRED) was included and referenced. In most of these uses, links to the
direct source of the FRED data are provided, and students are encouraged
to explore the information and the overall FRED resources more
thoroughly.</p>
<p>Additional updates and revisions appear throughout the book. They
reflect changes to economic realities and policies regarding
international trade, taxation, insurance, and other topics. For issues
that may change in the months or years following the textbook’s
publication, the authors often provided a more open-ended explanation,
but we will update the text annually to address further changes.</p>
<p>The revision of <em>Principles of Macroeconomics</em> was undertaken by Steven
Greenlaw (University of Mary Washington) and David Shapiro (Pennsylvania
State University), with significant input by lead reviewer Daniel
MacDonald (California State University, San Bernardino).</p>
<p>Pedagogical foundation</p>
<p>Throughout <em>Principles of Macroeconomics 2e</em>, you will find features
that engage the students in economic inquiry and support their learning.
Our features include:</p>
<p>Bring It Home: <span class="p">This added feature is a brief case study,
specific to each chapter, which connects the chapter’s main topic to the
real word. It is broken up into two parts: the first at the beginning of
the chapter (in the intro module) and the second at chapter’s end, when
students have learned what’s necessary to understand the case and “bring
home” the chapter’s core concepts.</span></p>
<p>Work It Out: <span class="p">This added feature asks students to work
through a generally analytical or computational problem, and guides them
step by step to find out how its solution is derived.</span></p>
<p>Clear It Up: <span class="p">This boxed feature, which includes
pre-existing features from Taylor’s text, addresses common student
misconceptions about the content. Clear It Ups are usually deeper
explanations of something in the main body of the text. Each CIU starts
with a question. The rest of the feature explains the answer.</span></p>
<p>Link It Up: <span class="p">This added feature is a very brief
introduction to a website that is pertinent to students’ understanding
and enjoyment of the topic at hand.</span></p>
<p>Questions for each level of learning</p>
<p>Principles of Macroeconomics 2e <span class="p">offers four types of
end-of-module questions for students:</span></p>
<p>Self-Checks <span class="p">are analytical self-assessment questions
that appear at the end of each module. They “click to</span></p>
<p>reveal” an answer in the web view so students can check their
understanding before moving on to the next module. Self-Check questions
are not simple look-up questions. They push the student to think beyond
what is said in the text. Self-Check questions are designed for
formative (rather than summative) assessment. The questions and answers
are explained so that students feel like they are being walked through
the problem.</p>
<p><strong>Review Questions</strong> have been retained from Taylor’s version, and are
simple recall questions from the chapter in open-response format
(<u>not</u> multiple choice or true/false). The answers can be looked up
in the text.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Thinking Questions</strong> are new higher-level, conceptual
questions that ask students to <em>demonstrate their understanding by
applying</em> what they have learned in different contexts. They ask for
outside-the-box thinking, for <em>reasoning</em> about the concepts. They push
the student to places they wouldn’t have thought of going themselves.</p>
<p>Problems <span class="p">are exercises that give students additional
practice working with the analytic and computational concepts in the
module.</span></p>
<p>Updated art</p>
<p>Principles of Macroeconomics 2e <span class="p">includes an updated art
program to better inform today’s student, providing the latest data on
covered topics.</span></p>

<p>Decisions … Decisions in the Social Media Age</p>
<p>To post or not to post? Every day we are faced with a myriad of
decisions, from what to have for breakfast, to which route to take
to class, to the more complex—“Should I double major and add
possibly another semester of study to my education?” Our response to
these choices depends on the information we have available at any
given moment. Economists call this “imperfect” because we rarely
have all the data we need to make perfect decisions. Despite the
lack of perfect information, we still make hundreds of decisions a
day.</p>
<p>Now we have another avenue in which to gather information—social
media. Outlets like Facebook and Twitter are altering the process by
which we make choices, how we spend our time, which movies we see,
which products we buy, and more. How many of you chose a university
without checking out its Facebook page or Twitter stream first for
information and feedback?</p>
<p>As you will see in this course, what happens in economics is
affected by how well and how fast information disseminates through a
society, such as how quickly information travels through Facebook.
“Economists love nothing better than when deep and liquid markets
operate under conditions of perfect information,” says Jessica
Irvine, National Economics Editor for News Corp Australia.</p>
<p>This leads us to the topic of this chapter, an introduction to the
world of making decisions, processing</p>
<p>information, and understanding behavior in markets —the world of
economics. Each chapter in this book will start with a discussion
about current (or sometimes past) events and revisit it at chapter’s
end—to “bring home” the concepts in play.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In this chapter, you will learn about:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What Is Economics, and Why Is It Important?</p></li>
<li><p>Microeconomics and Macroeconomics</p></li>
<li><p>How Economists Use Theories and Models to Understand Economic
Issues</p></li>
<li><p>How Economies Can Be Organized: An Overview of Economic Systems</p></li>
</ul>
<p>What is economics and why should you spend your time learning it?
After all, there are other disciplines you could be studying, and
other ways you could be spending your time. As the Bring it Home
feature just mentioned, making choices is at the heart of what
economists study, and your decision to take this course is as much
as economic decision as anything else.</p>
<p>Economics is probably not what you think. It is not primarily about
money or finance. It is not primarily about business. It is not
mathematics. What is it then? It is both a subject area and a way of
viewing the world.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><span id="bookmark8">|</span> <span
style=" color: #3767B1;">What Is Economics, and Why Is It
Important?</span><span id="bookmark15">‌</span></p>
<p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Discuss the importance of studying economics</p></li>
<li><p>Explain the relationship between production and division of
labor</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate the significance of scarcity</p>
<p><span id="bookmark16">Economics</span> <span class="p">is
the study of how humans make decisions in the face of
scarcity. These can be individual decisions, family
decisions, business decisions or societal decisions. If you
look around carefully, you will see that scarcity is a fact
of life. </span>Scarcity <span class="p">means that human
wants for goods, services and resources exceed what is
available. Resources, such as labor, tools, land, and raw
materials are necessary to produce the goods and services we
want but they exist in limited supply. Of course, the
ultimate scarce resource is time- everyone, rich or poor,
has just 24 expendable hours in the day to earn income to
acquire goods and services, for leisure time, or for sleep.
At any point in time, there is only a finite amount of
resources available.</span><span id="bookmark17">‌</span></p>
<p>Think about it this way: In 2015 the labor force in the
United States contained over 158 million workers, according
to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The total land area
was 3,794,101 square miles. While these are certainly large
numbers, they are not infinite. Because these resources are
limited, so are the numbers of goods and services we produce
with them. Combine this with the fact that human wants seem
to be virtually infinite, and you can see why scarcity is a
problem.</p>
<p>Introduction to FRED</p>
<p><a href="https://openstax.org/l/FRED/" class="s34">Data is very important in economics because it describes and measures the issues and problems that economics seek to understand. A variety of government agencies publish economic and social data. For this course, we will generally use data from the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank’s FRED database. FRED is very user friendly. It allows you to display data in tables or charges, and you can easily download it into spreadsheet form if you want to use the data for other purposes. The</a>
<a href="https://openstax.org/l/FRED/" class="a">FRED website (https://openstax.org/l/FRED/)</a>
<span class="p">includes data on nearly 400,000 domestic and
international variables over time, in the following broad
categories:</span></p>
</li>
<li><p>Money, Banking &amp; Finance</p></li>
<li><p>Population, Employment, &amp; Labor Markets (including Income
Distribution)</p></li>
<li><p>National Accounts (Gross Domestic Product &amp; its components),
Flow of Funds, and International Accounts</p></li>
<li><p>Production &amp; Business Activity (including Business Cycles)</p></li>
<li><p>Prices &amp; Inflation (including the Consumer Price Index, the
Producer Price Index, and the Employment Cost Index)</p></li>
<li><p>International Data from other nations</p></li>

Resources</span> <span class="s37">Homeless people are a
stark reminder that scarcity of resources is real. (Credit:

<p><a href="#bookmark18" class="s34">If you still do not believe that scarcity is a problem, consider the following: Does everyone require food to eat? Does everyone need a decent place to live? Does everyone have access to healthcare? In every country in the world, there are people who are hungry, homeless (for example, those who call park benches their beds, as</a>
<a href="#bookmark18" class="a">Figure 1.2</a> <span
class="p">shows), and in need of healthcare, just to focus
on a few critical goods and services. Why is this the case?
It is because of scarcity. Let’s delve into the concept of
scarcity a little deeper, because it is crucial to
understanding economics.</span></p>
<p>The Problem of Scarcity</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_029.png" width="624" height="37" alt="image" />
<p><a href="http://openstax.org/l/drought" class="s84">Visit this</a>
<a href="http://openstax.org/l/drought" class="s41">website (http://openstax.org/l/drought)</a>
<span style=" color: #000;">to read about how the United
States is dealing with scarcity in resources.</span></p>
<p>Think about all the things you consume: food, shelter,
clothing, transportation, healthcare, and entertainment. How
do you acquire those items? You do not produce them
yourself. You buy them. How do you afford the things you
buy? You work for pay. If you do not, someone else does on
your behalf. Yet most of us never have enough income to buy
all the things we want. This is because of scarcity. So how
do we solve it?</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_030.png" width="624" height="160" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark19">Every society, at every level, must
make choices about how to use its resources. Families must
decide whether to spend their money on a new car or a fancy
vacation. Towns must choose whether to put more of the
budget into police and fire protection or into the school
system. Nations must decide whether to devote more funds to
national defense or to protecting the environment. In most
cases, there just isn’t enough money in the budget to do
everything. How do we use our limited resources the best way
possible, that is, to obtain the most goods and services we
can? There are a couple of options. First, we could each
produce everything we each consume. Alternatively, we could
each produce some of what we want to consume, and “trade”
for the rest of what we want. Let’s explore these options.
Why do we not each just produce all of the things we
consume? Think back to pioneer days, when individuals knew
how to do so much more than we do today, from building their
homes, to growing their crops, to hunting for food, to
repairing their equipment. Most of us do not know how to do
all—or any—of those things, but it is not because we could
not learn. Rather, we do not have to. The reason why is
something called</span> <em>the division and specialization of
labor</em><a href="#bookmark20" class="s34">, a production innovation first put forth by Adam Smith (</a><a href="#bookmark20" class="a">Figure</a>
<span class="s54">1.3</span>) in his book, <em>The Wealth of
Nations</em>.</p>

<p>The Division of and Specialization of Labor</p>
<p><span id="bookmark21">The formal study of economics began
when Adam Smith (1723–1790) published his famous book</span>
<em>The Wealth of Nations</em> in 1776. Many authors had written on
economics in the centuries before Smith, but he was the
first to address the subject in a comprehensive way. In the
first chapter, Smith introduces the concept of <strong>division of
labor</strong>, which means that the way one produces a good or
service is divided into a number of tasks that different
workers perform, instead of all the tasks being done by the
same person.</p>
<p>To illustrate division of labor, Smith counted how many
tasks went into making a pin: drawing out a piece of wire,
cutting it to the right length, straightening it, putting a
head on one end and a point on the other, and packaging pins
for sale, to name just a few. Smith counted 18 distinct
tasks that different people performed—all for a pin, believe
it or not!</p>
<p>Modern businesses divide tasks as well. Even a relatively
simple business like a restaurant divides the task of
serving meals into a range of jobs like top chef, sous
chefs, less-skilled kitchen help, servers to wait on the
tables, a greeter at the door, janitors to clean up, and a
business manager to handle paychecks and bills—not to
mention the economic</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark22" class="s34">connections a restaurant has with suppliers of food, furniture, kitchen equipment, and the building where it is located. A complex business like a large manufacturing factory, such as the shoe factory (</a><a href="#bookmark22" class="a">Figure</a>
1.4<span class="p">), or a hospital can have hundreds of job
classifications.</span></p>

<p><span id="bookmark22">Figure 1.4 Division of Labor</span>
<span class="s37">Workers on an assembly line are an example

<p>Why the Division of Labor Increases Production</p>
<p>When we divide and subdivide the tasks involved with
producing a good or service, workers and businesses can
produce a greater quantity of output. In his observations of
pin factories, Smith noticed that one worker alone might
make 20 pins in a day, but that a small business of 10
workers (some of whom would need to complete two or three of
the 18 tasks involved with pin-making), could make 48,000
pins in a day. How can a group of workers, each specializing
in certain tasks, produce so much more than the same number
of workers who try to produce the entire good or service by
themselves? Smith offered three reasons.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark23">First,</span> <strong>specialization</strong> in a
particular small job allows workers to focus on the parts of
the production process where they have an advantage. (In
later chapters, we will develop this idea by discussing
comparative advantage.) People have different skills,
talents, and interests, so they will be better at some jobs
than at others. The particular advantages may be based on
educational choices, which are in turn shaped by interests
and talents. Only those with medical degrees qualify to
become doctors, for instance. For some goods, geography
affects specialization. For example, it is easier to be a
wheat farmer in North Dakota than in Florida, but easier to
run a tourist hotel in Florida than in North Dakota. If you
live in or near a big city, it is easier to attract enough
customers to operate a successful dry cleaning business or
movie theater than if you live in a sparsely populated rural
area. Whatever the reason, if people specialize in the
production of what they do best, they will be more effective
than if they produce a combination of things, some of which
they are good at and some of which they are not.<span
id="bookmark24">‌</span></p>
<p>Second, workers who specialize in certain tasks often learn
to produce more quickly and with higher quality. This
pattern holds true for many workers, including assembly line
laborers who build cars, stylists who cut hair, and doctors
who perform heart surgery. In fact, specialized workers
often know their jobs well enough to suggest innovative ways
to do their work faster and better.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark25">A similar pattern often operates
within businesses. In many cases, a business that focuses on
one or a few products (sometimes called its “core
competency”) is more successful than firms that try to make
a wide range of products.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark26">Third, specialization allows
businesses to take advantage of</span> <strong>economies of
scale</strong>, which means that for many goods, as the level of
production increases, the average cost of producing each
individual unit declines. For example, if a factory produces
only 100 cars per year, each car will be quite expensive to
make on average. However, if a factory produces 50,000 cars
each year, then it can set up an assembly line with huge
machines and workers performing specialized tasks, and the
average cost of production per car will be lower. The
ultimate result of workers who can focus on their
preferences and talents, learn to do their specialized jobs
better, and work in larger organizations is that society as
a whole can produce and consume far more than if each person
tried to produce all of his or her own goods and services.
The division and specialization of labor has been a force
against the problem of scarcity.</p>
<p>Trade and Markets</p>
<p>Specialization only makes sense, though, if workers can use
the pay they receive for doing their jobs to purchase the
other goods and services that they need. In short,
specialization requires trade.</p>
<p>You do not have to know anything about electronics or sound
systems to play music—you just buy an iPod or MP3 player,
download the music, and listen. You do not have to know
anything about artificial fibers or the construction of
sewing machines if you need a jacket—you just buy the jacket
and wear it. You do not need to know anything about internal
combustion engines to operate a car—you just get in and
drive. Instead of trying to acquire all the knowledge and
skills involved in producing all of the goods and services
that you wish to consume, the market allows you to learn a
specialized set of skills and then use the pay you receive
to buy the goods and services you need or want. This is how
our modern society has evolved into a strong economy.</p>
<p>Why Study Economics?</p>
<p>Now that you have an overview on what economics studies,
let’s quickly discuss why you are right to study it.
Economics is not primarily a collection of facts to
memorize, although there are plenty of important concepts to
learn. Instead, think of economics as a collection of
questions to answer or puzzles to work. Most importantly,
economics provides the tools to solve those puzzles. If the
economics “bug” has not bitten you yet, there are other
reasons why you should study economics.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Virtually every major problem facing the world today, from
global warming, to world poverty, to the conflicts in Syria,
Afghanistan, and Somalia, has an economic dimension. If you
are going to be part of solving those problems, you need to
be able to understand them. Economics is crucial.</p></li>
<li><p>It is hard to overstate the importance of economics to good
citizenship. You need to be able to vote intelligently on
budgets, regulations, and laws in general. When the U.S.
government came close to a standstill at the end of 2012 due
to the “fiscal cliff,” what were the issues? Did you know?</p></li>
<li><p>A basic understanding of economics makes you a well-rounded
thinker. When you read articles about economic issues, you
will understand and be able to evaluate the writer’s
argument. When you hear classmates, co-workers, or political
candidates talking about economics, you will be able to
distinguish between common sense and nonsense. You will find
new ways of thinking about current events and about personal
and business decisions, as well as current events and
politics.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The study of economics does not dictate the answers, but it can
illuminate the different choices.</p>
</li>
<li><p><span id="bookmark9">|</span> <span
style=" color: #3767B1;">Microeconomics and
Macroeconomics</span><span id="bookmark27">‌</span></p>
<p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Describe microeconomics</p></li>
<li><p>Describe macroeconomics</p></li>
<li><p>Contrast monetary policy and fiscal policy</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Economics is concerned with the well-being of <em>all</em> people,
including those with jobs and those without jobs, as well as
those with high incomes and those with low incomes. Economics
acknowledges that production of useful goods and services can
create problems of environmental pollution. It explores the
question of how investing in education helps to develop workers’
skills. It probes questions like how to tell when big businesses
or big labor unions are operating in a way that benefits society
as a whole and when they are operating in a way that benefits
their owners or members at the expense of others. It looks at
how government spending, taxes, and regulations affect decisions
about production and consumption.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark28">It should be clear by now that economics
covers considerable ground. We can divide that ground into two
parts:</span> <strong>Microeconomics</strong> focuses on the actions of
individual agents within the economy, like households, workers,
and businesses. <strong>Macroeconomics</strong> looks at the economy as a
whole. It focuses on broad issues such as growth of production,
the number of unemployed people, the inflationary increase in
prices, government deficits, and levels of exports and imports.
Microeconomics and macroeconomics are not separate subjects, but
rather complementary perspectives on the overall subject of the
economy.<span id="bookmark29">‌</span></p>
<p>To understand why both microeconomic and macroeconomic
perspectives are useful, consider the problem of studying a
biological ecosystem like a lake. One person who sets out to
study the lake might focus on specific topics: certain kinds of
algae or plant life; the characteristics of particular fish or
snails; or the trees surrounding the lake. Another person might
take an overall view and instead consider the lake’s ecosystem
from top to bottom; what eats what, how the system stays in a
rough balance, and what environmental stresses affect this
balance. Both approaches are useful, and both examine the same
lake, but the viewpoints are different. In a similar way, both
microeconomics and macroeconomics study the same economy, but
each has a different viewpoint.</p>
<p>Whether you are scrutinizing lakes or economics, the micro and
the macro insights should blend with each other. In studying a
lake, the micro insights about particular plants and animals
help to understand the overall food chain, while the macro
insights about the overall food chain help to explain the
environment in which individual plants and animals live.</p>
<p>In economics, the micro decisions of individual businesses are
influenced by whether the macroeconomy is healthy. For example,
firms will be more likely to hire workers if the overall economy
is growing. In turn, macroeconomy’s performance ultimately
depends on the microeconomic decisions that individual
households and businesses make.</p>
<p>Microeconomics</p>
<p>What determines how households and individuals spend their
budgets? What combination of goods and services will best fit
their needs and wants, given the budget they have to spend? How
do people decide whether to work, and if so, whether to work
full time or part time? How do people decide how much to save
for the future, or whether they should borrow to spend beyond
their current means?</p>
<p>What determines the products, and how many of each, a firm will
produce and sell? What determines the prices a firm will charge?
What determines how a firm will produce its products? What
determines how many workers it will hire? How will a firm
finance its business? When will a firm decide to expand,
downsize, or even close? In the microeconomics part of this
book, we will learn about the theory of consumer behavior, the
theory of the firm, how markets for labor and other resources
work, and how markets sometimes fail to work properly.</p>
<p>Macroeconomics</p>
<p>What determines the level of economic activity in a society? In
other words, what determines how many goods and services a
nation actually produces? What determines how many jobs are
available in an economy? What determines a nation’s standard of
living? What causes the economy to speed up or slow down? What
causes firms to hire more workers or to lay them off? Finally,
what causes the economy to grow over the long term?</p>
<p><span id="bookmark30">We can determine an economy’s
macroeconomic health by examining a number of goals: growth in
the standard of living, low unemployment, and low inflation, to
name the most important. How can we use government macroeconomic
policy to pursue these goals? A nation’s central bank
conducts</span> <strong>monetary policy</strong>, which involves policies
that affect bank lending, interest rates, and financial capital
markets. For the United States, this is the Federal Reserve. A
nation’s legislative body determines <strong>fiscal policy</strong>, which
involves government spending and taxes. For the United States,
this is the Congress and the executive branch, which originates
the federal budget. These are the government’s main tools.
Americans tend to expect that government can fix whatever
economic problems we encounter, but to what extent is that
expectation realistic? These are just some of the issues that we
will explore in the macroeconomic chapters of this book.<span

<span style=" color: #000;">about John Maynard Keynes and his
influence on economics.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark33" id="bookmark34" class="s34">John Maynard Keynes (1883–1946), one of the greatest economists of the twentieth century, pointed out that economics is not just a subject area but also a way of thinking. Keynes (</a><a href="#bookmark33" class="a">Figure</a>
1.5<span class="p">) famously wrote in the introduction to a
fellow economist’s book: “[Economics] is a method rather than
a doctrine, an apparatus of the mind, a technique of thinking,
which helps its possessor to draw correct conclusions.” In other
words, economics teaches you how to think, not what to
think.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark35">Economists see the world through a
different lens than anthropologists, biologists, classicists, or
practitioners of any other discipline. They analyze issues and
problems using economic theories that are based on particular
assumptions about human behavior. These assumptions tend to be
different than the assumptions an anthropologist or psychologist
might use. A</span> <strong>theory</strong> is a simplified representation of
how two or more variables interact with each other. The purpose
of a theory is to take a complex, real-world issue and simplify
it down to its essentials. If done well, this enables the
analyst to understand the issue and any problems around it. A
good theory is simple enough to understand, while complex enough
to capture the key features of the object or situation you are
studying.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark36">Sometimes economists use the term</span>
<strong>model</strong> instead of theory. Strictly speaking, a theory is a
more abstract representation, while a model is a more applied or
empirical representation. We use models to test theories, but
for this course we will use the terms interchangeably.</p>
<p>For example, an architect who is planning a major office
building will often build a physical model that sits on a
tabletop to show how the entire city block will look after the
new building is constructed. Companies often build models of
their new products, which are more rough and unfinished than the
final product, but can still demonstrate how the new product
will work.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark37">A good model to start with in economics is
the</span> <strong>circular flow diagram</strong>
<a href="#bookmark40" class="s34">(</a><a href="#bookmark40" class="a">Figure</a>
<span class="s54">1.6</span>). It pictures the economy as
consisting of two groups—households and firms—that interact in
two markets: the <strong>goods and services market</strong> in which firms
sell and households buy and the <strong>labor market</strong> in which
households sell labor to business firms or other employees.<span
id="bookmark38">‌</span><span id="bookmark39">‌</span></p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_035.jpg" width="288" height="270" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark40">Figure 1.6 The Circular Flow
Diagram</span> <span class="s37">The circular flow diagram shows
how households and firms interact in the goods and services
market, and in the labor market. The direction of the arrows
shows that in the goods and services market, households receive
goods and services and pay firms for them. In the labor market,
households provide labor and receive payment from firms through
wages, salaries, and benefits.</span></p>
<p>Firms produce and sell goods and services to households in the
market for goods and services (or product market). Arrow “A”
indicates this. Households pay for goods and services, which
becomes the revenues to firms. Arrow “B” indicates this. Arrows
A and B represent the two sides of the product market. Where do
households obtain the income to buy goods and services? They
provide the labor and other resources (e.g. land, capital, raw
materials) firms need to produce goods and services in the
market for inputs (or factors of production). Arrow “C”
indicates this. In return, firms pay for the inputs (or
resources) they use in the form of wages and other factor
payments. Arrow “D” indicates this. Arrows “C” and “D” represent
the two sides of the factor market.</p>
<p>Of course, in the real world, there are many different markets
for goods and services and markets for many different types of
labor. The circular flow diagram simplifies this to make the
picture easier to grasp. In the diagram, firms produce goods and
services, which they sell to households in return for revenues.
The outer circle shows this, and represents the two sides of the
product market (for example, the market for goods and services)
in which households demand and firms supply. Households sell
their labor as workers to firms in return for wages, salaries,
and benefits. The inner circle shows this and represents the two
sides of the labor market in which households supply and firms
demand.</p>
<p>This version of the circular flow model is stripped down to the
essentials, but it has enough features to explain how the
product and labor markets work in the economy. We could easily
add details to this basic model if we wanted to introduce more
real-world elements, like financial markets, governments, and
interactions with the rest of the globe (imports and exports).</p>
<p>Economists carry a set of theories in their heads like a
carpenter carries around a toolkit. When they see an economic
issue or problem, they go through the theories they know to see
if they can find one that fits. Then they use the theory to
derive insights about the issue or problem. Economists express
theories as diagrams, graphs, or even as mathematical equations.
(Do not worry. In this course, we will mostly use graphs.)
Economists do not figure out the answer to the problem first and
then draw the graph to illustrate. Rather, they use the graph of
the theory to help them figure out the answer. Although at the
introductory level, you can sometimes figure out the right
answer without applying a model, if you keep studying economics,
before too long you will run into issues and problems that you
will need to graph to solve. We explain both micro and
macroeconomics in terms of theories and models. The most
well-known theories are probably those of supply and demand, but
you will learn a number of others.</p>

of Economic Systems</span><span id="bookmark41">‌</span></p>
<p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Contrast traditional economies, command economies, and
market economies</p></li>
<li><p>Explain gross domestic product (GDP)</p></li>
<li><p>Assess the importance and effects of globalization</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Think about what a complex system a modern economy is. It
includes all production of goods and services, all buying and
selling, all employment. The economic life of every individual
is interrelated, at least to a small extent, with the economic
lives of thousands or even millions of other individuals. Who
organizes and coordinates this system? Who insures that, for
example, the number of televisions a society provides is the
same as the amount it needs and wants? Who insures that the
right number of employees work in the electronics industry? Who
insures that televisions are produced in the best way possible?
How does it all get done?</p>
<p><span id="bookmark42">There are at least three ways that
societies organize an economy. The first is the</span>
<strong>traditional economy</strong>, which is the oldest economic system and
is used in parts of Asia, Africa, and South America. Traditional
economies organize their economic affairs the way they have
always done (i.e., tradition). Occupations stay in the family.
Most families are farmers who grow the crops using traditional
methods. What you produce is what you consume. Because tradition
drives the way of life, there is little economic progress or
development.</p>

<p><span id="bookmark44">Command economies are very different. In
a</span> <strong>command
economy</strong><a href="#bookmark43" class="s34">, economic effort is devoted to goals passed down from a ruler or ruling class. Ancient Egypt was a good example: a large part of economic life was devoted to building pyramids, like those in</a>
<a href="#bookmark43" class="a">Figure</a> <span
class="s54">1.7</span>, for the pharaohs. Medieval manor life is
another example: the lord provided the land for growing crops
and protection in the event of war. In return, vassals provided
labor and soldiers to do the lord’s bidding. In the last
century, communism emphasized command economies.</p>
<p>In a command economy, the government decides what goods and
services will be produced and what prices it will charge for
them. The government decides what methods of production to use
and sets wages for workers. The government provides many
necessities like healthcare and education for free. Currently,
Cuba and North Korea have command economies.</p>

<p><span id="bookmark45">Figure 1.8 A Market Economy</span> <span
class="s37">Nothing says “market” more than The New York Stock
Exchange. (Credit: Erik Drost/ Flickr Creative Commons)</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark46">Although command economies have a very
centralized structure for economic decisions, market economies
have a very decentralized structure. A</span> <strong>market</strong>
<a href="#bookmark45" class="s34">is an institution that brings together buyers and sellers of goods or services, who may be either individuals or businesses. The New York Stock Exchange (</a><a href="#bookmark45" class="a">Figure</a>
<span class="s54">1.8</span>) is a prime example of a market
which brings buyers and sellers together. In a <strong>market
economy</strong>, decision-making is decentralized. Market economies
are based on <strong>private enterprise</strong>: the private individuals or
groups of private individuals own and operate the means of
production (resources and businesses). Businesses supply goods
and services based on demand. (In a command economy, by
contrast, the government owns resources and businesses.) Supply
of goods and services depends on what the demands. A person’s
income is based on his or her ability to convert resources
(especially labor) into something that society values. The more
society values the person’s output, the higher the income (think
Lady Gaga or LeBron James). In this scenario, market forces, not
governments, determine economic decisions.<span

<p>What countries are considered economically free?</p>
<p>Who is in control of economic decisions? Are people free to do
what they want and to work where they want? Are businesses free
to produce when they want and what they choose, and to hire and
fire as they wish? Are banks free to choose who will receive
loans, or does the government control these kinds of choices?
Each year, researchers at the Heritage Foundation and the <em>Wall
Street Journal</em> look at 50 different categories of economic
freedom for countries around the world. They give each nation a
score based on the extent of economic freedom in each category.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark49" class="s84">The 2016 Heritage Foundation’s Index of Economic Freedom report ranked 178 countries around the world:</a>
<a href="#bookmark49" class="s43">Table 1.1</a> <span
class="s37">lists some examples of the most free and the least
free countries. Several additional countries were not ranked
because of extreme instability that made judgments about
economic freedom impossible. These countries include
Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Somalia, and Yemen.</span></p>
<p>The assigned rankings are inevitably based on estimates, yet
even these rough measures can be useful for discerning trends.
In 2015, 101 of the 178 included countries shifted toward
greater economic freedom, although 77 of the countries shifted
toward less economic freedom. In recent decades, the overall
trend has been a <em>higher level of economic freedom around the
world</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://openstax.org/l/cato" class="s34">Most economies in the real world are mixed. They combine elements of command and market (and even traditional) systems. The U.S. economy is positioned toward the market-oriented end of the spectrum. Many countries in Europe and Latin America, while primarily market-oriented, have a greater degree of government involvement in economic decisions than the U.S. economy. China and Russia, while over the past several decades have moved more in the direction of having a market-oriented system, remain closer to the command economy end of the spectrum. The Heritage Foundation provides information about how free and thus market-oriented different countries’ are, as the following Clear It Up feature discusses.

<p>Regulations: The Rules of the Game</p>
<p><span id="bookmark50">Markets and government regulations are
always entangled. There is no such thing as an absolutely free
market. Regulations always define the “rules of the game” in the
economy. Economies that are primarily market-oriented have fewer
regulations—ideally just enough to maintain an even playing
field for participants. At a minimum, these laws govern matters
like safeguarding private property against theft, protecting
people from violence, enforcing legal contracts, preventing
fraud, and collecting taxes. Conversely, even the most
command-oriented economies operate using markets. How else would
buying and selling occur? The government heavily regulates
decisions of what to produce and prices to charge. Heavily
regulated economies often have</span> <strong>underground economies</strong>
(or black markets), which are markets where the buyers and
sellers make transactions without the government’s approval.</p>
<p>The question of how to organize economic institutions is
typically not a black-or-white choice between all market or all
government, but instead involves a balancing act over the
appropriate combination of market freedom and government rules.</p>

<p>The Rise of Globalization</p>
<p><span id="bookmark52">Recent decades have seen a trend
toward</span> <strong>globalization</strong>, which is the expanding
cultural, political, and economic connections between people
around the world. One measure of this is the increased buying
and selling of goods, services, and assets across national
borders—in other words, international trade and financial
capital flows.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark51" class="s34">Globalization has occurred for a number of reasons. Improvements in shipping, as illustrated by the container ship in</a>
<a href="#bookmark51" class="a">Figure</a> 1.9<span class="p">,
and air cargo have driven down transportation costs. Innovations
in computing and telecommunications have made it easier and
cheaper to manage long-distance economic connections of
production and sales. Many valuable products and services in the
modern economy can take the form of information—for example:
computer software; financial advice; travel planning; music,
books and movies; and blueprints for designing a building. These
products and many others can be transported over telephones and
computer networks at ever-lower costs. Finally, international
agreements and treaties between countries have encouraged
greater trade.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark56" id="bookmark53" class="a">Table 1.2</a><span
class="s54"> </span>presents one measure of globalization. It
shows the percentage of domestic economic production that was
exported for a selection of countries from 2010 to 2015,
according to an entity known as The World Bank. <strong>Exports</strong> are
the goods and services that one produces domestically and sells
abroad. <strong>Imports</strong> are the goods and services that one produces
abroad and then sells domestically. <strong>Gross domestic product
(GDP)</strong> measures the size of total production in an economy.
Thus, the ratio of exports divided by GDP measures what share of
a country’s total economic production is sold in other
countries.<span id="bookmark54">‌</span><span

<p>Table 1.2 The Extent of Globalization (exports/GDP)
<a href="http://databank.worldbank.org/data/)" class="s48">(Source: http://databank.worldbank.org/data/)</a></p>
<p>In recent decades, the export/GDP ratio has generally risen,
both worldwide and for the U.S. economy. Interestingly, the
share of U.S. exports in proportion to the U.S. economy is well
below the global average, in part because large economies like
the United States can contain more of the division of labor
inside their national borders. However, smaller economies like
Belgium, Korea, and Canada need to trade across their borders
with other countries to take full advantage of division of
labor, specialization, and economies of scale. In this sense,
the enormous U.S. economy is less affected by globalization than
most other countries.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark56" class="a">Table 1.2</a> <span
class="p">indicates that many medium and low income countries
around the world, like Mexico and China, have also experienced a
surge of globalization in recent decades. If an astronaut in
orbit could put on special glasses that make all economic
transactions visible as brightly colored lines and look down at
Earth, the astronaut would see the planet covered with
connections.</span></p>
<p>Despite the rise in globalization over the last few decades, in
recent years we’ve seen significant pushback against
globalization from people across the world concerned about loss
of jobs, loss of political sovereignty, and increased economic
inequality. Prominent examples of this pushback include the 2016
vote in Great Britain to exit the European Union (i.e. Brexit),
and the election of Donald J. Trump for President of the United
States.</p>

<p>Decisions … Decisions in the Social Media Age</p>
<p>The world we live in today provides nearly instant access to a
wealth of information. Consider that as recently as the late
1970s, the <em>Farmer’s Almanac</em>, along with the Weather Bureau of
the U.S. Department of Agriculture, were the primary sources
American farmers used to determine when to plant and harvest
their crops. Today, farmers are more likely to access, online,
weather forecasts from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration or watch the Weather Channel. After all, knowing
the upcoming forecast could drive when to harvest crops.
Consequently, knowing the upcoming weather could change the
amount of crop harvested.</p>
<p>Some relatively new information forums, such as Facebook, are
rapidly changing how information is distributed; hence,
influencing decision making. In 2014, the Pew Research Center
reported that 71% of online adults use Facebook. This social
media forum posts topics ranging from the National Basketball
Association, to celebrity singers and performers, to farmers.</p>
<p>Information helps us make decisions as simple as what to wear
today to how many reporters the media should send to cover a
crash. Each of these decisions is an economic decision. After
all, resources are scarce. If the media send ten reporters to
cover an accident, they are not available to cover other stories
or complete other tasks. Information provides the necessary
knowledge to make the best possible decisions on how to utilize
scarce resources. Welcome to the world of economics!</p>

<p>KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY</p>
<ol>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark15" class="a">What Is Economics, and Why Is It</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark15">Important?</a></p>
<p>Economics seeks to solve the problem of scarcity, which is
when human wants for goods and services exceed the available
supply. A modern economy displays a division of labor, in
which people earn income by specializing in what they
produce and then use that income to purchase the products
they need or want. The division of labor allows individuals
and firms to specialize and to produce more for several
reasons: a) It allows the agents to focus on areas of
advantage due to natural factors and skill levels; b) It
encourages the agents to learn and invent; c) It allows
agents to take advantage of economies of scale. Division and
specialization of labor only work when individuals can
purchase what they do not produce in markets. Learning about
economics helps you understand the major problems facing the
world today, prepares you to be a good citizen, and helps
you become a well-rounded thinker.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark27" class="a">Microeconomics and</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark27">Macroeconomics</a></p>
<p>Microeconomics and macroeconomics are two different
perspectives on the economy. The microeconomic perspective
focuses on parts of the economy: individuals, firms, and
industries. The macroeconomic perspective looks at the
economy as a whole, focusing on goals like growth in the
standard of living, unemployment, and inflation.
Macroeconomics has two types of policies for pursuing these
goals: monetary policy and fiscal policy.</p>

<li><p><a href="#bookmark32" class="a">How Economists Use Theories and Models to Understand Economic</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark32">Issues</a></p>
<p>Economists analyze problems differently than do other
disciplinary experts. The main tools economists use are
economic theories or models. A theory is not an illustration
of the answer to a problem. Rather, a theory is a tool for
determining the answer.</p>

</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We can organize societies as traditional, command, or
market-oriented economies. Most societies are a mix. The last few
decades have seen globalization evolve as a result of growth in
commercial and financial networks that cross national borders,
making businesses and workers from different economies increasingly
interdependent.</p>

<p>Choices … To What Degree?</p>
<p>In 2015, the median income for workers who hold master’s degrees varies
from males to females. The average of the two is $2,951 weekly. Multiply
this average by 52 weeks, and you get an average salary of</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(153,452. Compare that to the median weekly earnings for a full-time
worker over 25 with no higher than a bachelor’s degree: \)</span>1,224 weekly
and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(63,648 a year. What about those with no higher than a high school
diploma in 2015? They earn just \)</span>664 weekly and $34,528 over 12 months.
In other words, says the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), earning a
bachelor’s degree boosted salaries 54% over what you would have earned
if you had stopped your education after high school. A master’s degree
yields a salary almost double that of a high school diploma.</p>
<p>Given these statistics, we might expect many people to choose to go to
college and at least earn a bachelor’s degree. Assuming that people want
to improve their material well-being, it seems like they would make
those choices that provide them with the greatest opportunity to consume
goods and services. As it turns out, the analysis is not nearly as
simple as this. In fact, in 2014, the BLS reported that while almost 88%
of the population in the United States had a high school diploma, only
33.6% of 25–65 year olds had bachelor’s degrees, and only 7.4% of 25–65
year olds in 2014 had earned a master’s.</p>
<p>This brings us to the subject of this chapter: why people make the
choices they make and how economists explain those choices.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark96">Figure 2.1 Choices and Tradeoffs</span> <span
class="s37">In general, the higher the degree, the higher the salary, so
why aren’t more people pursuing higher degrees? The short answer:

<h2>Introduction to Choice in a World of Scarcity<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-to-choice-in-a-world-of-scarcity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In this chapter, you will learn about:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How Individuals Make Choices Based on Their Budget Constraint</p></li>
<li><p>The Production Possibilities Frontier and Social Choices</p></li>
<li><p>Confronting Objections to the Economic Approach</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will learn quickly when you examine the relationship between
economics and scarcity that choices involve tradeoffs. Every choice has
a cost.</p>
<p>In 1968, the Rolling Stones recorded “You Can’t Always Get What You
Want.” Economists chuckled, because they had been singing a similar tune
for decades. English economist Lionel Robbins (1898–1984), in his <em>Essay
on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science</em> in 1932, described
not always getting what you want in this way:</p>
<p>The time at our disposal is limited. There are only twenty-four hours in
the day. We have to choose between the different uses to which they may
be put. Everywhere we turn, if we choose one thing we</p>
<p>must relinquish others which, in different circumstances, we would wish
not to have relinquished. Scarcity of means to satisfy given ends is an
almost ubiquitous condition of human nature.</p>
<p>Because people live in a world of scarcity, they cannot have all the
time, money, possessions, and experiences they wish. Neither can
society.</p>
<p>This chapter will continue our discussion of scarcity and the economic
way of thinking by first introducing three critical concepts:

<p><a href="#bookmark98" class="s34">Consider the typical consumer’s budget problem. Consumers have a limited amount of income to spend on the things they need and want. Suppose Alphonso has <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10 in spending money each week that he can allocate between bus tickets for getting to work and the burgers that he eats for lunch. Burgers cost \)</span>2 each, and bus tickets are 50 cents each. We can see Alphonso’s budget problem in</a>

class="p">.</span></p>

<p><span id="bookmark98">Figure 2.2 The Budget Constraint: Alphonso’s
Consumption Choice Opportunity Frontier</span> <span
class="s37">Each point on the budget constraint represents a
combination of burgers and bus tickets whose total cost adds up to
Alphonso’s budget of $10. The relative price of burgers and bus
tickets determines the slope of the budget constraint. All along the
budget set, giving up one burger means gaining four bus
tickets.</span></p>
<p>The vertical axis in the figure shows burger purchases and the
horizontal axis shows bus ticket purchases. If Alphonso spends all
his money on burgers, he can afford five per week. (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10 per week/\)</span>2
per burger = 5 burgers per week.) However, if he does this, he will
not be able to afford any bus tickets. Point A in the figure shows
the choice (zero bus tickets and five burgers). Alternatively, if
Alphonso spends all his money on bus tickets, he can afford 20 per
week. (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10 per week/\)</span>0.50 per bus ticket = 20 bus tickets per week.)
Then, however, he will not be able to afford any burgers. Point F
shows this alternative choice (20 bus tickets and zero burgers).</p>
<p><span id="bookmark99">If we connect all the points between A and F,
we get Alphonso’s</span> <strong>budget constraint</strong>. This indicates all
the combination of burgers and bus tickets Alphonso can afford,
given the price of the two goods and his budget amount.</p>
<p>If Alphonso is like most people, he will choose some combination
that includes both bus tickets and burgers. That is, he will choose
some combination on the budget constraint that is between points A
and F. Every point on (or inside) the constraint shows a combination
of burgers and bus tickets that Alphonso can afford. Any point
outside the constraint is not affordable, because it would cost more
money than Alphonso has in his budget.</p>
<p>The budget constraint clearly shows the tradeoff Alphonso faces in
choosing between burgers and bus tickets. Suppose he is currently at
point D, where he can afford 12 bus tickets and two burgers. What
would it cost Alphonso for one more burger? It would be natural to
answer $2, but that’s not the way economists think. Instead they
ask, how many bus tickets would Alphonso have to give up to get one
more burger, while staying within his budget? Since bus tickets cost
50 cents, Alphonso would have to give up four to afford one more
burger. That is the true cost to Alphonso.</p>
<p>The Concept of Opportunity Cost</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_047.png" width="624" height="236" alt="image" />

(<a class="reference external" href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/linestanding">http://openstaxcollege.org/l/linestanding</a>) <span
style=" color: #000;">for an example of opportunity cost—paying
someone else to wait in line for you.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark100">Economists use the term</span> <strong>opportunity
cost</strong> to indicate what one must give up to obtain what he or she
desires. The idea behind opportunity cost is that the cost of one
item is the lost opportunity to do or consume something else. In
short, opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative.
For Alphonso, the opportunity cost of a burger is the four bus
tickets he would have to give up. He would decide whether or not to
choose the burger depending on whether the value of the burger
exceeds the value of the forgone alternative—in this case, bus
tickets. Since people must choose, they inevitably face tradeoffs in
which they have to give up things they desire to obtain other things
they desire more.</p>
<p>A fundamental principle of economics is that every choice has an
opportunity cost. If you sleep through your economics class, the
opportunity cost is the learning you miss from not attending class.
If you spend your income on video games, you cannot spend it on
movies. If you choose to marry one person, you give up the
opportunity to marry anyone else. In short, opportunity cost is all
around us and part of human existence.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1750" class="s34">The following Work It Out feature shows a step-by-step analysis of a budget constraint calculation. Read through it to understand another important concept—slope—that we further explain in the appendix</a>
<a href="#bookmark1750" class="a">The Use of Mathematics in Principles of</a>
Economics<span class="p">.</span></p>
<p>Understanding Budget Constraints</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1750" class="s84">Budget constraints are easy to understand if you apply a little math. The appendix</a>
<a href="#bookmark1750" class="s43">The Use of Mathematics in Principles of</a>
Economics <span class="s37">explains all the math you are likely to
need in this book. Therefore, if math is not your strength, you
might want to take a look at the appendix.</span></p>
<p>Step 1: The equation for any budget constraint is:</p>
<p>Budget = P<span class="s55">1</span><span class="s56"> </span>×
Q<span class="s55">1</span><span class="s56"> </span>+ P<span
class="s55">2</span><span class="s56"> </span>× Q<span
class="s55">2</span></p>
<p>where P and Q are the price and quantity of items purchased (which
we assume here to be two items) and Budget is the amount of income
one has to spend.</p>
<p>Step 2. Apply the budget constraint equation to the scenario. In
Alphonso’s case, this works out to be:</p>
<p>Budget = P<span class="s55">1</span><span class="s56"> </span>×
Q<span class="s55">1</span><span class="s56"> </span>+ P<span
class="s55">2</span><span class="s56"> </span>× Q<span
class="s55">2</span></p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10 budget = \)</span>2 per burger × quantity of burgers + $0.50 per bus
ticket × quantity of bus tickets</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10 = \)</span>2 × Q<span class="s58">burgers</span><span class="s59">
</span>+ $0.50 × Q<span class="s58">bus</span><span class="s59">
tickets</span></p>
<p>Step 3. Using a little algebra, we can turn this into the familiar
equation of a line:</p>
<p>y = b + mx</p>
<p>For Alphonso, this is:</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10 = \)</span>2 × Q<span class="s58">burgers</span><span class="s59">
</span>+ $0.50 × Q<span class="s58">bus</span><span class="s59">
tickets</span></p>
<p>Step 4. Simplify the equation. Begin by multiplying both sides of
the equation by 2:</p>
<p>2 × 10 = 2 × 2 × Q<span class="s55">burgers</span><span class="s56">
</span>+ 2 × 0.5 × Q<span class="s55">bus</span><span class="s56">
tickets</span></p>
<p>20 = 4 × Q<span class="s58">burgers</span><span class="s59">
</span>+ 1 × Q<span class="s58">bus</span><span class="s59">
tickets</span></p>
<p>Step 5. Subtract one bus ticket from both sides:</p>
<p>20 – Q<span class="s58">bus</span><span class="s59"> tickets
</span>= 4 × Q<span class="s58">burgers</span></p>
<p>Divide each side by 4 to yield the answer:</p>
<p>5 – 0.25 × Q<span class="s58">bus</span><span class="s59"> tickets
</span>= Q<span class="s58">burgers</span></p>
<p>or</p>
<p>Q<span class="s58">burgers</span><span class="s59"> </span>= 5 –
0.25 × Q<span class="s58">bus</span><span class="s59">
tickets</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark98" class="s84">Step 6. Notice that this equation fits the budget constraint in</a>
<a href="#bookmark98" class="s43">Figure</a>
2.2<a href="#bookmark101" class="s84">. The vertical intercept is 5 and the slope is –0.25, just as the equation says. If you plug 20 bus tickets into the equation, you get 0 burgers. If you plug other numbers of bus tickets into the equation, you get the results (see</a>
<a href="#bookmark101" class="s43">Table</a> 2.1<span class="s37">),

<p>Table 2.1</p>
<p>Step 7. Notice that the slope of a budget constraint always shows
the opportunity cost of the good which is on the horizontal axis.
For Alphonso, the slope is −0.25, indicating that for every bus
ticket he buys, he must give up 1/4 burger. To phrase it
differently, for every four tickets he buys, Alphonso must give up 1
burger.</p>
<p>There are two important observations here. First, the algebraic sign
of the slope is negative, which means that the only way to get more
of one good is to give up some of the other. Second, we define the
slope as the price of bus tickets (whatever is on the horizontal
axis in the graph) divided by the price of burgers (whatever is on
the vertical axis), in this case <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0.50/\)</span>2 = 0.25. If you want to
determine the opportunity cost quickly, just divide the two prices.</p>
<p>Identifying Opportunity Cost</p>
<p><span id="bookmark102">In many cases, it is reasonable to refer to
the opportunity cost as the price. If your cousin buys a new bicycle
for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(300, then \)</span>300 measures the amount of “other consumption” that
he has forsaken. For practical purposes, there may be no special
need to identify the specific alternative product or products that
he could have bought with that $300, but sometimes the price as
measured in dollars may not accurately capture the true opportunity
cost. This problem can loom especially large when costs of time are
involved.</span></p>
<p>For example, consider a boss who decides that all employees will
attend a two-day retreat to “build team spirit.” The out-of-pocket
monetary cost of the event may involve hiring an outside consulting
firm to run the retreat, as well as room and board for all
participants. However, an opportunity cost exists as well: during
the two days of the retreat, none of the employees are doing any
other work.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_050.png" width="624" height="51" alt="image" />
<p>What is the opportunity cost associated with increased airport
security measures?</p>
<p>After the terrorist plane hijackings on September 11, 2001, many
steps were proposed to improve air travel safety. For example, the
federal government could provide armed “sky marshals” who would
travel inconspicuously with the rest of the passengers. The cost of
having a sky marshal on every flight would be roughly <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3 billion per
year. Retrofitting all U.S. planes with reinforced cockpit doors to
make it harder for terrorists to take over the plane would have a
price tag of \)</span>450 million. Buying more sophisticated security
equipment for airports, like three-dimensional baggage scanners and
cameras linked to face recognition software, could cost another $2
billion.</p>
<p>However, the single biggest cost of greater airline security does
not involve spending money. It is the opportunity cost of additional
waiting time at the airport. According to the United States
Department of Transportation (DOT), there were 895.5 million
systemwide (domestic and international) scheduled service passengers
in 2015. Since the 9/11 hijackings, security screening has become
more intensive, and consequently, the procedure takes longer than in
the past. Say that, on average, each air passenger spends</p>
<p>Attending college is another case where the opportunity cost exceeds
the monetary cost. The out-of-pocket costs of attending college
include tuition, books, room and board, and other expenses. However,
in addition, during the hours that you are attending class and
studying, it is impossible to work at a paying job. Thus, college
imposes both an out-of-pocket cost and an opportunity cost of lost
earnings.</p>
<p>an extra 30 minutes in the airport per trip. Economists commonly
place a value on time to convert an opportunity cost in time into a
monetary figure. Because many air travelers are relatively high-paid
business people, conservative estimates set the average price of
time for air travelers at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(20 per hour. By these back-
of-the-envelope calculations, the opportunity cost of delays in
airports could be as much as 800 million × 0.5 hours × \)</span>20/hour, or
$8 billion per year. Clearly, the opportunity costs of waiting time
can be just as important as costs that involve direct spending.</p>
<p>In some cases, realizing the opportunity cost can alter behavior.
Imagine, for example, that you spend <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(8 on lunch every day at work.
You may know perfectly well that bringing a lunch from home would
cost only \)</span>3 a day, so the opportunity cost of buying lunch at the
restaurant is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(5 each day (that is, the \)</span>8 buying lunch costs minus
the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3 your lunch from home would cost). Five dollars each day does
not seem to be that much. However, if you project what that adds up
to in a year—250 days a year × \)</span>5 per day equals <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1,250, the cost,
perhaps, of a decent vacation. If you describe the opportunity cost
as “a nice vacation” instead of “\)</span>5 a day,” you might make different
choices.</p>
<p>Marginal Decision-Making and Diminishing Marginal Utility</p>
<p><span id="bookmark103">The budget constraint framework helps to
emphasize that most choices in the real world are not about getting
all of one thing or all of another; that is, they are not about
choosing either the point at one end of the budget constraint or
else the point all the way at the other end. Instead, most choices
involve</span> <strong>marginal analysis</strong>, which means examining the
benefits and costs of choosing a little more or a little less of a
good. People naturally compare costs and benefits, but often we look
at total costs and total benefits, when the optimal choice
necessitates comparing how costs and benefits change from one option
to another. You might think of marginal analysis as “change
analysis.” Marginal analysis is used throughout economics.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark104">We now turn to the notion of</span>
<strong>utility</strong><a href="http://cnx.org/content/m63895/latest/" class="s34">. People desire goods and services for the satisfaction or utility those goods and services provide. Utility, as we will see in the chapter on</a>
<a href="http://cnx.org/content/m63895/latest/" class="a">Consumer Choices (http://cnx.org/content/m63895/ latest/)</a><span
class="s54"> </span>, is subjective but that does not make it less
real. Economists typically assume that the more of some good one
consumes (for example, slices of pizza), the more utility one
obtains. At the same time, the utility a person receives from
consuming the first unit of a good is typically more than the
utility received from consuming the fifth or the tenth unit of that
same good. When Alphonso chooses between burgers and bus tickets,
for example, the first few bus rides that he chooses might provide
him with a great deal of utility—perhaps they help him get to a job
interview or a doctor’s appointment. However, later bus rides might
provide much less utility—they may only serve to kill time on a
rainy day. Similarly, the first burger that Alphonso chooses to buy
may be on a day when he missed breakfast and is ravenously hungry.
However, if Alphonso has a burger every single day, the last few
burgers may taste pretty boring. The general pattern that
consumption of the first few units of any good tends to bring a
higher level of utility to a person than consumption of later units
is a common pattern. Economists refer to this pattern as the <strong>law
of diminishing marginal utility</strong>, which means that as a person
receives more of a good, the additional (or marginal) utility from
each additional unit of the good declines. In other words, the first
slice of pizza brings more satisfaction than the sixth.<span
id="bookmark105">‌</span></p>
<p>The law of diminishing marginal utility explains why people and
societies rarely make all-or-nothing choices. You would not say, “My
favorite food is ice cream, so I will eat nothing but ice cream from
now on.” Instead, even if you get a very high level of utility from
your favorite food, if you ate it exclusively, the additional or
marginal utility from those last few servings would not be very
high. Similarly, most workers do not say: “I enjoy leisure, so I’ll
never work.” Instead, workers recognize that even though some
leisure is very nice, a combination of all leisure and no income is
not so attractive. The budget constraint framework suggests that
when people make choices in a world of scarcity, they will use
marginal analysis and think about whether they would prefer a little
more or a little less.</p>
<p>A rational consumer would only purchase additional units of some
product as long as the marginal utility exceeds the opportunity
cost. Suppose Alphonso moves down his budget constraint from Point A
to Point B to Point C and further. As he consumes more bus tickets,
the marginal utility of bus tickets will diminish, while the
opportunity cost, that is, the marginal utility of foregone burgers,
will increase. Eventually, the opportunity cost will exceed the
marginal utility of an additional bus ticket. If Alphonso is
rational, he won’t purchase more bus tickets once the marginal
utility just equals the opportunity cost. While we can’t (yet) say
exactly how many bus tickets Alphonso will buy, that number is
unlikely to be the most he can afford, 20.</p>
<p>Sunk Costs</p>
<p>In the budget constraint framework, all decisions involve what will
happen next: that is, what quantities of goods will</p>
<p><span id="bookmark106">you consume, how many hours will you work, or
how much will you save. These decisions do not look back to past
choices. Thus, the budget constraint framework assumes that</span>
<strong>sunk costs</strong>, which are costs that were incurred in the past and
cannot be recovered, should not affect the current decision.</p>
<p>Consider the case of Selena, who pays $8 to see a movie, but after
watching the film for 30 minutes, she knows that it is truly
terrible. Should she stay and watch the rest of the movie because
she paid for the ticket, or should she leave? The money she spent is
a sunk cost, and unless the theater manager is sympathetic, Selena
will not get a refund. However, staying in the movie still means
paying an opportunity cost in time. Her choice is whether to spend
the next 90 minutes suffering through a cinematic disaster or to do
something—anything—else. The lesson of sunk costs is to forget about
the money and time that is irretrievably gone and instead to focus
on the marginal costs and benefits of current and future options.</p>
<p>For people and firms alike, dealing with sunk costs can be
frustrating. It often means admitting an earlier error in judgment.
Many firms, for example, find it hard to give up on a new product
that is doing poorly because they spent so much money in creating
and launching the product. However, the lesson of sunk costs is to
ignore them and make decisions based on what will happen in the
future.</p>
<p>From a Model with Two Goods to One of Many Goods</p>
<p>The budget constraint diagram containing just two goods, like most
models used in this book, is not realistic. After all, in a modern
economy people choose from thousands of goods. However, thinking
about a model with many goods is a straightforward extension of what
we discussed here. Instead of drawing just one budget constraint,
showing the tradeoff between two goods, you can draw multiple budget
constraints, showing the possible tradeoffs between many different
pairs of goods. In more advanced classes in economics, you would use
mathematical equations that include many possible goods and services
that can be purchased, together with their quantities and prices,
and show how the total spending on all goods and services is limited
to the overall budget available. The graph with two goods that we
presented here clearly illustrates that every choice has an
opportunity cost, which is the point that does carry over to the
real world.</p>

<p><span id="bookmark108">Just as individuals cannot have everything
they want and must instead make choices, society as a whole cannot
have everything it might want, either. This section of the chapter
will explain the constraints society faces, using a model called
the</span> <strong>production possibilities frontier (PPF)</strong>. There are
more similarities than differences between individual choice and
social choice. As you read this section, focus on the similarities.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark109" class="s34">Because society has limited resources (e.g., labor, land, capital, raw materials) at any point in time, there is a limit to the quantities of goods and services it can produce. Suppose a society desires two products, healthcare and education. The production possibilities frontier in</a>
<a href="#bookmark109" class="a">Figure 2.3</a> <span
class="p">illustrates this situation.</span></p>

<p><a href="#bookmark109" class="a">Figure 2.3</a> <span

resources to healthcare, it could produce at point A. However, it
would not have any resources to produce education. If it were to
allocate all of its resources to education, it could produce at
point F. Alternatively, the society could choose to produce any
combination of healthcare and education on the production
possibilities frontier. In effect, the production possibilities
frontier plays the same role for society as the budget constraint
plays for Alphonso. Society can choose any combination of the two
goods on or inside the PPF. However, it does not have enough
resources to produce outside the PPF.</span></p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_052.png" width="624" height="51" alt="image" />
<p>What’s the difference between a budget constraint and a PPF?</p>
<p>There are two major differences between a budget constraint and a
production possibilities frontier. The first is the fact that the
budget constraint is a straight line. This is because its slope is
given by the relative prices of the two goods, which from the point
of view of an individual consumer, are fixed, so the slope doesn’t
change. In contrast, the PPF has a curved shape because of the law
of the diminishing returns. Thus, the slope is different at various
points on the PPF. The second major difference is the absence of
specific numbers on the axes of the PPF. There are no specific
numbers because we do not know the exact amount of resources this
imaginary economy has, nor do we know how many resources it takes to
produce healthcare and how many resources it takes to produce
education. If this were a real world example, that data would be
available.</p>
<p>Whether or not we have specific numbers, conceptually we can measure
the opportunity cost of additional education as society moves from
point B to point C on the PPF. We measure the additional education
by the horizontal distance between B and C. The foregone healthcare
is given by the vertical distance between B and C. The slope of the
PPF between B and C is (approximately) the vertical distance (the
“rise”) over the horizontal distance (the “run”). This is the
opportunity cost of the additional education.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark110">Most importantly, the production
possibilities frontier clearly shows the tradeoff between healthcare
and education. Suppose society has chosen to operate at point B, and
it is considering producing more education. Because the PPF is
downward sloping from left to right, the only way society can obtain
more education is by giving up some healthcare. That is the tradeoff
society faces. Suppose it considers moving from point B to point C.
What would the opportunity cost be for the additional education? The
opportunity cost would be the healthcare society has to forgo. Just
as with Alphonso’s budget constraint, the</span> <strong>slope</strong> of the
production possibilities frontier shows the opportunity cost. By now
you might be saying, “Hey, this PPF is sounding like the budget
constraint.” If so, read the following Clear It Up feature.</p>
<p>The Shape of the PPF and the Law of Diminishing Returns</p>
<p><span id="bookmark111">The budget constraints that we presented
earlier in this chapter, showing individual choices about what
quantities of goods to consume, were all straight lines. The reason
for these straight lines was that the relative prices of the two
goods in the</span> <strong>consumption budget constraint</strong> determined the
slope of the budget constraint. However, we drew the production
possibilities frontier for healthcare and education as a curved
line. Why does the PPF have a different shape?</p>
<p>To understand why the PPF is curved, start by considering point A at
the top left-hand side of the PPF. At point A, all available
resources are devoted to healthcare and none are left for education.
This situation would be extreme and even ridiculous. For example,
children are seeing a doctor every day, whether they are sick or
not, but not attending school. People are having cosmetic surgery on
every part of their bodies, but no high school or college education
exists. Now imagine that some of these resources are diverted from
healthcare to education, so that the economy is at point B instead
of point A. Diverting some resources away from A to B causes
relatively little reduction in health because the last few marginal
dollars going into healthcare services are not producing much
additional gain in health. However, putting those marginal dollars
into education, which is completely without resources at point A,
can produce relatively large gains. For this reason, the shape of
the PPF from A to B is relatively flat, representing a relatively
small drop-off in health and a relatively large gain in education.</p>
<p>Now consider the other end, at the lower right, of the production
possibilities frontier. Imagine that society starts at choice D,
which is devoting nearly all resources to education and very few to
healthcare, and moves to point F, which is devoting <em>all</em> spending
to education and none to healthcare. For the sake of concreteness,
you can imagine that in the movement from D to F, the last few
doctors must become high school science teachers, the last few
nurses must become school librarians rather than dispensers of
vaccinations, and the last few emergency rooms are turned into
kindergartens. The gains to education from adding these last few
resources to education are very small. However, the opportunity cost
lost to health will be fairly large, and thus the slope of the PPF
between D and F is steep, showing a large drop in health for only a
small gain in education.</p>
<p>The lesson is not that society is likely to make an extreme choice
like devoting no resources to education at point A or no resources
to health at point F. Instead, the lesson is that the gains from
committing additional marginal resources to education depend on how
much is already being spent. If on the one hand, very few resources
are currently committed to education, then an increase in resources
used can bring relatively large gains. On the other hand, if a large
number of resources are already committed to education, then
committing additional resources will bring relatively smaller gains.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark112">This pattern is common enough that economists
have given it a name: the</span> <strong>law of diminishing returns</strong>,
which holds that as additional increments of resources are added to
a certain purpose, the marginal benefit from those additional
increments will decline. (The law of diminishing marginal utility
that we introduced in the last section is a more specific case of
the law of diminishing returns.) When government spends a certain
amount more on reducing crime, for example, the original gains in
reducing crime could be relatively large. However, additional
increases typically cause relatively smaller reductions in crime,
and paying for enough police and security to reduce crime to nothing
at all would be tremendously expensive.</p>
<p>The curvature of the production possibilities frontier shows that as
we add more resources to education, moving from left to right along
the horizontal axis, the original gains are fairly large, but
gradually diminish. Thus, the slope of the PPF is relatively flat.
By contrast, as we add more resources to healthcare, moving from
bottom to top on the vertical axis, the original gains are fairly
large, but again gradually diminish. Thus, the slope of the PPF is
relatively steep. In this way, the law of diminishing returns
produces the outward-bending shape of the production possibilities
frontier.</p>
<p>Productive Efficiency and Allocative Efficiency</p>
<p><span id="bookmark113">The study of economics does not presume to
tell a society what choice it should make along its production
possibilities frontier. In a market-oriented economy with a
democratic government, the choice will involve a mixture of
decisions by individuals, firms, and government. However, economics
can point out that some choices are unambiguously better than
others. This observation is based on the concept of efficiency. In
everyday usage, efficiency refers to lack of waste. An inefficient
machine operates at high cost, while an efficient machine operates
at lower cost, because it is not wasting energy or materials. An
inefficient organization operates with long delays and high costs,
while an efficient organization meets schedules, is focused, and
performs within budget.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark114" class="s34">The production possibilities frontier can illustrate two kinds of efficiency: productive efficiency and allocative efficiency.</a>
<a href="#bookmark114" class="a">Figure</a> 2.4 <span
class="p">illustrates these ideas using a production possibilities
frontier between healthcare and</span></p>
<p>education.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_053.jpg" width="224" height="224" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark114">Figure 2.4 Productive and Allocative
Efficiency</span> <span class="s37">Productive efficiency means it
is impossible to produce more of one good without decreasing the
quantity that is produced of another good. Thus, all choices along a
given PPF like B, C, and D display productive efficiency, but R does
not. Allocative efficiency means that the particular mix of goods
being produced—that is, the specific choice along the production
possibilities frontier—represents the allocation that society most
desires.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark115">Productive efficiency</span>
<a href="#bookmark114" class="s34">means that, given the available inputs and technology, it is impossible to produce more of one good without decreasing the quantity that is produced of another good. All choices on the PPF in</a>
<a href="#bookmark114" class="a">Figure</a> <span
class="s54">2.4</span><span class="p">, including A, B, C, D, and F,
display productive efficiency. As a firm moves from any one of these
choices to any other, either healthcare increases and education
decreases or vice versa. However, any choice inside the production
possibilities frontier is productively inefficient and wasteful
because it is possible to produce more of one good, the other good,
or some combination of both goods.</span></p>
<p>For example, point R is productively inefficient because it is
possible at choice C to have more of both goods: education on the
horizontal axis is higher at point C than point R (E<span
class="s60">2</span> is greater than E<span class="s60">1</span>),
and healthcare on the vertical axis is also higher at point C than
point R (H<span class="s60">2</span> is great than H<span
class="s60">1</span>).</p>
<p>We can show the particular mix of goods and services produced—that
is, the specific combination of selected healthcare and education
along the production possibilities frontier—as a ray (line) from the
origin to a specific point on the PPF. Output mixes that had more
healthcare (and less education) would have a steeper ray, while
those with more education (and less healthcare) would have a flatter
ray.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark116">Allocative efficiency</span> <span
class="p">means that the particular combination of goods and
services on the production possibility curve that a society produces
represents the combination that society most desires. How to
determine what a society desires can be a controversial question,
and is usually a discussion in political science, sociology, and
philosophy classes as well as in economics. At its most basic,
allocative efficiency means producers supply the quantity of each
product that consumers demand. Only one of the productively
efficient choices will be the allocatively efficient choice for
society as a whole.</span></p>
<p>Why Society Must Choose</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark14" class="s34">In</a>
<a href="#bookmark14" class="a">Welcome to Economics!</a> <span
class="p">we learned that every society faces the problem of
scarcity, where limited resources conflict with unlimited needs and
wants. The production possibilities curve illustrates the choices
involved in this dilemma.</span></p>
<p>Every economy faces two situations in which it may be able to expand
consumption of all goods. In the first case, a society may discover
that it has been using its resources inefficiently, in which case by
improving efficiency and producing on the production possibilities
frontier, it can have more of all goods (or at least more of some
and less of none). In the second case, as resources grow over a
period of years (e.g., more labor and more capital), the economy
grows. As it does, the production possibilities frontier for a
society will tend to shift outward and society will be able to
afford more of all goods.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark117">However, improvements in productive
efficiency take time to discover and implement, and economic growth
happens only gradually. Thus, a society must choose between
tradeoffs in the present. For government, this process often
involves trying to identify where additional spending could do the
most good and where reductions in spending would do the least harm.
At the individual and firm level, the market economy coordinates a
process in which firms seek to produce goods and services in the
quantity, quality, and price that people want. However, for both the
government and the market economy in the short term, increases in
production of one good typically mean offsetting decreases somewhere
else in the economy.</span></p>
<p>The PPF and Comparative Advantage</p>
<p>While every society must choose how much of each good or service it
should produce, it does not need to produce every single good it
consumes. Often how much of a good a country decides to produce
depends on how expensive it is to produce it versus buying it from a
different country. As we saw earlier, the curvature of a country’s
PPF gives us information about the tradeoff between devoting
resources to producing one good versus another. In particular, its
slope gives the opportunity cost of producing one more unit of the
good in the x-axis in terms of the other good (in the y-axis).
Countries tend to have different opportunity costs of producing a
specific good, either because of different climates, geography,
technology, or skills.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark118" class="s34">Suppose two countries, the US and Brazil, need to decide how much they will produce of two crops: sugar cane and wheat. Due to its climatic conditions, Brazil can produce quite a bit of sugar cane per acre but not much wheat. Conversely, the U.S. can produce large amounts of wheat per acre, but not much sugar cane. Clearly, Brazil has a lower opportunity cost of producing sugar cane (in terms of wheat) than the U.S. The reverse is also true: the U.S. has a lower opportunity cost of producing wheat than Brazil. We illustrate this by the PPFs of the two countries in</a>
<a href="#bookmark118" class="a">Figure</a> 2.5<span
class="p">.</span></p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_054.jpg" width="608" height="307" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark118">Figure 2.5 Production Possibility Frontier
for the U.S. and Brazil</span> <span class="s37">The U.S. PPF is
flatter than the Brazil PPF implying that the opportunity cost of
wheat in terms of sugar cane is lower in the U.S. than in Brazil.
Conversely, the opportunity cost of sugar cane is lower in Brazil.
The U.S. has comparative advantage in wheat and Brazil has
comparative advantage in sugar cane.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark119">When a country can produce a good at a lower
opportunity cost than another country, we say that this country has
a</span> <strong>comparative advantage</strong> in that good. Comparative
advantage is not the same as absolute advantage, which is when a
country can produce more of a good. Comparative advantage is not the
same as absolute advantage, which is when a country can produce more
of a good. In our example, Brazil has an absolute advantage in sugar
cane and the U.S. has an absolute advantage in wheat. One can easily
see this with a simple observation of the extreme production points
in the PPFs of the two countries. If Brazil devoted all of its
resources to producing wheat, it would be producing at point</p>
<p>A. If however it had devoted all of its resources to producing sugar
cane instead, it would be producing a much larger</p>
<p>amount than the U.S., at point B.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1593" class="s34">The slope of the PPF gives the opportunity cost of producing an additional unit of wheat. While the slope is not constant throughout the PPFs, it is quite apparent that the PPF in Brazil is much steeper than in the U.S., and therefore the opportunity cost of wheat generally higher in Brazil. In the chapter on</a>
<a href="#bookmark1593" class="a">International Trade</a> <span
class="p">you will learn that countries’ differences in comparative
advantage determine which goods they will choose to produce and
trade. When countries engage in trade, they specialize in the
production of the goods in which they have comparative advantage,
and trade part of that production for goods in which they do not
have comparative advantage. With trade, manufacturers produce goods
where the opportunity cost is lowest, so total production increases,
benefiting both trading parties.</span></p>

<li><p><span id="bookmark93">|</span> <span
style=" color: #3767B1;">Confronting Objections to the Economic
Approach</span><span id="bookmark120">‌</span></p>
<p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Analyze arguments against economic approaches to decision-making</p></li>
<li><p>Interpret a tradeoff diagram</p></li>
<li><p>Contrast normative statements and positive statements</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is one thing to understand the economic approach to
decision-making and another thing to feel comfortable applying it.
The sources of discomfort typically fall into two categories: that
people do not act in the way that fits the economic way of thinking,
and that even if people did act that way, they should try not to.
Let’s consider these arguments in turn.</p>
<p>First Objection: People, Firms, and Society Do Not Act Like This</p>
<p>The economic approach to decision-making seems to require more
information than most individuals possess and more careful
decision-making than most individuals actually display. After all,
do you or any of your friends draw a budget constraint and mutter to
yourself about maximizing utility before you head to the shopping
mall? Do members of the U.S. Congress contemplate production
possibilities frontiers before they vote on the annual budget? The
messy ways in which people and societies operate somehow doesn’t
look much like neat budget constraints or smoothly curving
production possibilities frontiers.</p>
<p>However, the economics approach can be a useful way to analyze and
understand the tradeoffs of economic decisions. To appreciate this
point, imagine for a moment that you are playing basketball,
dribbling to the right, and throwing a bounce-pass to the left to a
teammate who is running toward the basket. A physicist or engineer
could work out the correct speed and trajectory for the pass, given
the different movements involved and the weight and bounciness of
the ball. However, when you are playing basketball, you do not
perform any of these calculations. You just pass the ball, and if
you are a good player, you will do so with high accuracy.</p>
<p>Someone might argue: “The scientist’s formula of the bounce-pass
requires a far greater knowledge of physics and far more specific
information about speeds of movement and weights than the basketball
player actually has, so it must be an unrealistic description of how
basketball passes actually occur.” This reaction would be
wrongheaded. The fact that a good player can throw the ball
accurately because of practice and skill, without making a physics
calculation, does not mean that the physics calculation is wrong.</p>
<p><a href="http://cnx.org/content/m63895/latest/" class="s34">Similarly, from an economic point of view, someone who shops for groceries every week has a great deal of practice with how to purchase the combination of goods that will provide that person with utility, even if the shopper does not phrase decisions in terms of a budget constraint. Government institutions may work imperfectly and slowly, but in general, a democratic form of government feels pressure from voters and social institutions to make the choices that are most widely preferred by people in that society. Thus, when thinking about the economic actions of groups of people, firms, and society, it is reasonable, as a first approximation, to analyze them with the tools of economic analysis. For more on this, read about behavioral economics in the chapter on</a>
<a href="http://cnx.org/content/m63895/latest/" class="a">Consumer Choices</a>
(<a class="reference external" href="http://cnx.org/content/m63895/latest/">http://cnx.org/content/m63895/latest/</a>) <span class="p">.</span></p>
<p>Second Objection: People, Firms, and Society Should Not Act This Way</p>
<p>The economics approach portrays people as self-interested. For some
critics of this approach, even if self-interest is an accurate
description of how people behave, these behaviors are not moral.
Instead, the critics argue that people</p>
<p>should be taught to care more deeply about others. Economists offer
several answers to these concerns.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark121">First, economics is not a form of moral
instruction. Rather, it seeks to describe economic behavior as it
actually exists. Philosophers draw a distinction between</span>
<strong>positive statements</strong>, which describe the world as it is, and
<strong>normative statements</strong>, which describe how the world should be.
Positive statements are factual. They may be true or false, but we
can test them, at least in principle. Normative statements are
subjective questions of opinion. We cannot test them since we cannot
prove opinions to be true or false. They just are opinions based on
one’s values. For example, an economist could analyze a proposed
subway system in a certain city. If the expected benefits exceed the
costs, he concludes that the project is worthy—an example of
positive analysis. Another economist argues for extended
unemployment compensation during the Great Depression because a rich
country like the United States should take care of its less
fortunate citizens—an example of normative analysis.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark122">Even if the line between positive and
normative statements is not always crystal clear, economic analysis
does try to remain rooted in the study of the actual people who
inhabit the actual economy. Fortunately however, the assumption that
individuals are purely self-interested is a simplification about
human nature. In fact, we need to look no further than to Adam
Smith, the very father of modern economics to find evidence of this.
The opening sentence of his book,</span> <em>The Theory of Moral
Sentiments</em>, puts it very clearly: “How selfish soever man may be
supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which
interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness
necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it except the
pleasure of seeing it.” Clearly, individuals are both
self-interested and altruistic.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_055.png" width="624" height="51" alt="image" />
<p>Is a diagram by any other name the same?</p>
<p>When you study economics, you may feel buried under an avalanche of
diagrams. Your goal should be to recognize the common underlying
logic and pattern of the diagrams, not to memorize each one.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark126" class="s84">This chapter uses only one basic diagram, although we present it with different sets of labels. The consumption budget constraint and the production possibilities frontier for society, as a whole, are the same basic diagram.</a>
Figure 2.6 <span class="s37">shows an individual budget constraint
and a production possibilities frontier for two goods, Good 1 and
Good 2. The tradeoff diagram always illustrates three basic themes:
scarcity, tradeoffs, and economic efficiency.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark123">The first theme is scarcity. It is not
feasible to have unlimited amounts of both goods. Even if the budget
constraint or a PPF shifts, scarcity remains—just at a different
level. The second theme is tradeoffs. As depicted in the budget
constraint or the production possibilities frontier, it is necessary
to forgo some of one good to gain more of the other good. The
details of this tradeoff vary. In a budget constraint we determine,
the tradeoff is determined by the relative prices of the goods: that
is, the relative price of two goods in the consumption choice budget
constraint. These tradeoffs appear as a straight line. However, a
curved line represents the tradeoffs in many production
possibilities frontiers because the law of diminishing returns holds
that as we add resources to an area, the marginal gains tend to
diminish. Regardless of the specific shape, tradeoffs
remain.</span><span id="bookmark124">‌</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark125">The third theme is economic efficiency, or
getting the most benefit from scarce resources. All choices on the
production possibilities frontier show productive efficiency because
in such cases, there is no way to increase the quantity of one good
without decreasing the quantity of the other. Similarly, when an
individual makes a</span></p>
<p>Second, we can label self-interested behavior and profit-seeking
with other names, such as personal choice and freedom. The ability
to make personal choices about buying, working, and saving is an
important personal freedom. Some people may choose high-pressure,
high-paying jobs so that they can earn and spend considerable
amounts of money on themselves. Others may allocate large portions
of their earnings to charity or spend it on their friends and
family. Others may devote themselves to a career that can require
much time, energy, and expertise but does not offer high financial
rewards, like being an elementary school teacher or a social worker.
Still others may choose a job that does consume much of their time
or provide a high level of income, but still leaves time for family,
friends, and contemplation. Some people may prefer to work for a
large company; others might want to start their own business.
People’s freedom to make their own economic choices has a moral
value worth respecting.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_056.png" width="624" height="500" alt="image" />
<p>choice along a budget constraint, there is no way to increase the
quantity of one good without decreasing the quantity of the other.
The choice on a production possibilities set that is socially
preferred, or the choice on an individual’s budget constraint that
is personally preferred, will display allocative efficiency.</p>
<p>The basic budget constraint/production possibilities frontier
diagram will recur throughout this book. Some examples include using
these tradeoff diagrams to analyze trade, environmental protection
and economic output, equality of incomes and economic output, and
the macroeconomic tradeoff between consumption and investment. Do
not allow the different labels to confuse you. The budget
constraint/production possibilities frontier diagram is always just
a tool for thinking carefully about scarcity, tradeoffs, and
efficiency in a particular situation.</p>
<p>Figure 2.6 The Tradeoff Diagram <span class="s37">Both the
individual opportunity set (or budget constraint) and the social
production possibilities frontier show the constraints under which
individual consumers and society as a whole operate. Both diagrams
show the tradeoff in choosing more of one good at the cost of less
of the other.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark126">Third, self-interested behavior can lead to
positive social results. For example, when people work hard to make
a living, they create economic output. Consumers who are looking for
the best deals will encourage businesses to offer goods and services
that meet their needs. Adam Smith, writing in</span> <em>The Wealth of
Nations</em>, named this property the <strong>invisible hand</strong>. In describing
how consumers and producers interact in a market economy, Smith
wrote:<span id="bookmark127">‌</span></p>
<p>Every individual…generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the
public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By
preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he
intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in
such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he
intends only his own gain. And he is in this, as in many other
cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part
of his intention…By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes
that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to
promote it.</p>
<p>The metaphor of the invisible hand suggests the remarkable
possibility that broader social good can emerge from selfish
individual actions.</p>
<p>Fourth, even people who focus on their own self-interest in the
economic part of their life often set aside their own narrow
self-interest in other parts of life. For example, you might focus
on your own self-interest when asking your employer for a raise or
negotiating to buy a car. Then you might turn around and focus on
other people when you volunteer to read stories at the local
library, help a friend move to a new apartment, or donate money to a
charity. Self- interest is a reasonable starting point for analyzing
many economic decisions, without needing to imply that people never
do anything that is not in their own immediate self-interest.</p>

<p>Choices … To What Degree?</p>
<p>What have we learned? We know that scarcity impacts all the choices
we make. An economist might argue that people do not obtain a
bachelor’s or master’s degree because they do not have the resources
to make those choices or because their incomes are too low and/or
the price of these degrees is too high. A bachelor’s or a master’s
degree may not be available in their opportunity set.</p>
<p>The price of these degrees may be too high not only because the
actual price, college tuition (and perhaps room and board), is too
high. An economist might also say that for many people, the full
opportunity cost of a bachelor’s or a master’s degree is too high.
For these people, they are unwilling or unable to make the tradeoff
of forfeiting years of working, and earning an income, to earn a
degree.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark128">Finally, the statistics we introduced at the
start of the chapter reveal information about intertemporal choices.
An economist might say that people choose not to obtain a college
degree because they may have to borrow money to attend college, and
the interest they have to pay on that loan in the future will affect
their decisions today. Also, it could be that some people have a
preference for current consumption over future consumption, so they
choose to work now at a lower salary and consume now, rather than
postponing that consumption until after they graduate
college.</span></p>

<p>KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY</p>
<ol>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark97" class="a">How Individuals Make Choices Based on Their Budget</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark97">Constraint</a></p>
<p>Economists see the real world as one of scarcity: that is, a
world in which people’s desires exceed what is possible. As a
result, economic behavior involves tradeoffs in which
individuals, firms, and society must forgo something that they
desire to obtain things that they desire more. Individuals face
the tradeoff of what quantities of goods and services to
consume. The budget constraint, which is the frontier of the
opportunity set, illustrates the range of available choices. The
relative price of the choices determines the slope of the budget
constraint. Choices beyond the budget constraint are not
affordable.</p>
<p>Opportunity cost measures cost by what we forgo in exchange.
Sometimes we can measure opportunity cost in money, but it is
often useful to consider time as well, or to measure it in terms
of the actual resources that we must forfeit.</p>
<p>Most economic decisions and tradeoffs are not all-or-nothing.
Instead, they involve marginal analysis, which means they are
about decisions on the margin, involving a little more or a
little less. The law of diminishing marginal utility points out
that as a person receives more of something—whether it is a
specific good or another resource—the</p>
<p>additional marginal gains tend to become smaller. Because sunk
costs occurred in the past and cannot be recovered, they should
be disregarded in making current decisions.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark107" class="a">The Production Possibilities Frontier and Social</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark107">Choices</a></p>
<p>A production possibilities frontier defines the set of choices
society faces for the combinations of goods and services it can
produce given the resources available. The shape of the PPF is
typically curved outward, rather than straight. Choices outside
the PPF are unattainable and choices inside the PPF are
wasteful. Over time, a growing economy will tend to shift the
PPF outwards.</p>
<p>The law of diminishing returns holds that as increments of
additional resources are devoted to producing something, the
marginal increase in output will become increasingly smaller.
All choices along a production possibilities frontier display
productive efficiency; that is, it is impossible to use
society’s resources to produce more of one good without
decreasing production of the other good. The specific choice
along a production possibilities frontier that reflects the mix
of goods society prefers is the choice with allocative
efficiency. The curvature of the PPF is likely to differ by
country, which results in different countries having comparative
advantage in different goods. Total production can increase if
countries specialize in the goods in which they have comparative
advantage and trade some of their production for the remaining
goods.</p>

<p>The economic way of thinking provides a useful approach to understanding
human behavior. Economists make the careful distinction between positive
statements, which describe the world as it is, and normative statements,
which describe how the world should be. Even when economics analyzes the
gains and losses from various events or policies, and thus draws
normative conclusions about how the world should be, the analysis of
economics is rooted in a positive analysis of how people, firms, and
governments actually behave, not how they should behave.</p>

<p>Why Can We Not Get Enough of Organic?</p>
<p>Organic food is increasingly popular, not just in the United States, but
worldwide. At one time, consumers had to go to specialty stores or
farmers’ markets to find organic produce. Now it is available in most
grocery stores. In short, organic is part of the mainstream.</p>
<p>Ever wonder why organic food costs more than conventional food? Why,
say, does an organic Fuji apple cost</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1.99 a pound, while its conventional counterpart costs \)</span>1.49 a pound?
The same price relationship is true for just about every organic product
on the market. If many organic foods are locally grown, would they not
take less time to get to market and therefore be cheaper? What are the
forces that keep those prices from coming down? Turns out those forces
have quite a bit to do with this chapter’s topic: demand and supply.</p>

style=" color: #000;">to read a list of bizarre items that have been
purchased for their ties to celebrities. These examples represent an
interesting facet of demand and supply.</span></p>
<p>An auction bidder pays thousands of dollars for a dress Whitney Houston
wore. A collector spends a small fortune for a few drawings by John
Lennon. People usually react to purchases like these in two ways: their
jaw drops because they think these are high prices to pay for such goods
or they think these are rare, desirable items and the amount paid seems
right.</p>
<p>When economists talk about prices, they are less interested in making
judgments than in gaining a practical understanding of what determines
prices and why prices change. Consider a price most of us contend with
weekly: that of a gallon of gas. Why was the average price of gasoline
in the United States <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3.71 per gallon in June 2014? Why did the price
for gasoline fall sharply to \)</span>1.96 per gallon by January 2016? To
explain these price movements, economists focus on the determinants of
what gasoline buyers are willing to pay and what gasoline sellers are
willing to accept.</p>
<p>As it turns out, the price of gasoline in June of any given year is
nearly always higher than the price in January of that same year. Over
recent decades, gasoline prices in midsummer have averaged about 10
cents per gallon more than their midwinter low. The likely reason is
that people drive more in the summer, and are also willing to pay more
for gas, but that does not explain how steeply gas prices fell. Other
factors were at work during those 18 months, such as increases in supply
and decreases in the demand for crude oil.</p>
<p>This chapter introduces the economic model of demand and supply—one of
the most powerful models in all of economics. The discussion here begins
by examining how demand and supply determine the price and the quantity
sold in markets for goods and services, and how changes in demand and
supply lead to changes in prices and quantities.</p>

for Goods and Services</span><span id="bookmark160">‌</span></p>
<p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Explain demand, quantity demanded, and the law of demand</p></li>
<li><p>Identify a demand curve and a supply curve</p></li>
<li><p>Explain supply, quantity supplied, and the law of supply</p></li>
<li><p>Explain equilibrium, equilibrium price, and equilibrium quantity</p></li>
</ul>
<p>First let’s first focus on what economists mean by demand, what they
mean by supply, and then how demand and supply interact in a market.</p>
<p>Demand for Goods and Services</p>
<p><span id="bookmark161">Economists use the term</span> <strong>demand</strong> to
refer to the amount of some good or service consumers are willing
and able to purchase at each price. Demand is fundamentally based on
needs and wants—if you have no need or want for something, you won’t
buy it. While a consumer may be able to differentiate between a need
and a want, but from an economist’s perspective they are the same
thing. Demand is also based on ability to pay. If you cannot pay for
it, you have no effective demand. By this definition, a homeless
person probably has no effective demand for shelter.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark162">What a buyer pays for a unit of the specific
good or service is called</span> <strong>price</strong>. The total number of
units that consumers would purchase at that price is called the
<strong>quantity demanded</strong>. A rise in price of a good or service almost
always decreases the quantity demanded of that good or service.
Conversely, a fall in price will increase the quantity demanded.
When the price of a gallon of gasoline increases, for example,
people look for ways to reduce their consumption by combining
several errands, commuting by carpool or mass transit, or taking
weekend or vacation trips closer to home. Economists call this
inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded the <strong>law
of demand</strong>. The law of demand assumes that all other variables that
affect demand (which we explain in the next module) are held
constant.<span id="bookmark163">‌</span><span
id="bookmark164">‌</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark167" id="bookmark165" class="s34">We can show an example from the market for gasoline in a table or a graph. Economist call a table that shows the quantity demanded at each price, such as</a>
<a href="#bookmark167" class="a">Table</a> <span
class="s54">3.1</span>, a <strong>demand schedule</strong>. In this case we
measure price in dollars per gallon of gasoline. We measure the
quantity demanded in millions of gallons over some time period (for
example, per day or per year) and over some geographic area (like a
state or a country). A <strong>demand curve</strong>
<a href="#bookmark168" class="s34">shows the relationship between price and quantity demanded on a graph like</a>
<a href="#bookmark168" class="a">Figure</a> <span
class="s54">3.2</span>, with quantity on the horizontal axis and the

variable (y) goes on the vertical. Economics is not math.)<span

<span class="s37">The demand schedule shows that as price rises,
quantity demanded decreases, and vice versa. We graph these points,

<p>Demand curves will appear somewhat different for each product. They
may appear relatively steep or flat, or they may be straight or
curved. Nearly all demand curves share the fundamental similarity
that they slope down from left to right. Demand curves embody the
law of demand: As the price increases, the quantity demanded
decreases, and conversely, as the price decreases, the quantity
demanded increases.</p>

demanded. When economists talk about demand, they mean the
relationship between a range of prices and the quantities demanded
at those prices, as illustrated by a demand curve or a demand
schedule. When economists talk about quantity demanded, they mean
only a certain point on the demand curve, or one quantity on the
demand schedule. In short, demand refers to the curve and quantity
demanded refers to the (specific) point on the curve.</p>

<p>Supply of Goods and Services</p>
<p><span id="bookmark169">When economists talk about</span> <strong>supply</strong>,
they mean the amount of some good or service a producer is willing
to supply at each price. Price is what the producer receives for
selling one unit of a good or service. A rise in price almost always
leads to an increase in the <strong>quantity supplied</strong> of that good or
service, while a fall in price will decrease the quantity supplied.
When the price of gasoline rises, for example, it encourages
profit-seeking firms to take several actions: expand exploration for
oil reserves; drill for more oil; invest in more pipelines and oil
tankers to bring the oil to plants for refining into gasoline; build
new oil refineries; purchase additional pipelines and trucks to ship
the gasoline to gas stations; and open more gas stations or keep
existing gas stations open longer hours. Economists call this
positive relationship between price and quantity supplied—that a
higher price leads to a higher quantity supplied and a lower price
leads to a lower quantity supplied—the <strong>law of supply</strong>. The law of
supply assumes that all other variables that affect supply (to be
explained in the next module) are held constant.<span

<p>Is supply the same as quantity supplied?</p>
<p>In economic terminology, supply is not the same as quantity
supplied. When economists refer to supply, they mean the
relationship between a range of prices and the quantities supplied
at those prices, a relationship that we can illustrate with a supply
curve or a supply schedule. When economists refer to quantity
supplied, they mean only a certain point on the supply curve, or one
quantity on the supply schedule. In short, supply refers to the
curve and quantity supplied refers to the (specific) point on the
curve.</p>

market for gasoline as an example. Like demand, we can illustrate
supply using a table or a graph. A <strong>supply schedule</strong>
<a href="#bookmark176" class="s34">is a table, like</a>
<a href="#bookmark176" class="a">Table</a> <span

of different prices. Again, we measure price in dollars per gallon
of gasoline and we measure quantity supplied in millions of gallons.
A <strong>supply curve</strong> is a graphic illustration of the relationship
between price, shown on the vertical axis, and quantity, shown on
the horizontal axis. The supply schedule and the supply curve are
just two different ways of showing the same information. Notice that
the horizontal and vertical axes on the graph for the supply curve
are the same as for the demand curve.<span id="bookmark174">‌</span></p>

quantity supplied of gasoline at each price. As price rises,
quantity supplied also increases, and vice versa. The supply

<p>Table 3.2 Price and Supply of Gasoline</p>
<p>The shape of supply curves will vary somewhat according to the
product: steeper, flatter, straighter, or curved. Nearly all supply
curves, however, share a basic similarity: they slope up from left
to right and illustrate the law of supply: as the price rises, say,
from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1.00 per gallon to \)</span>2.20 per gallon, the quantity supplied
increases from 500 gallons to 720 gallons. Conversely, as the price
falls, the quantity supplied decreases.</p>
<p>Equilibrium—Where Demand and Supply Intersect</p>
<p>Because the graphs for demand and supply curves both have price on
the vertical axis and quantity on the horizontal axis, the demand
curve and supply curve for a particular good or service can appear
on the same graph. Together, demand and supply determine the price
and the quantity that will be bought and sold in a market.</p>

<p>Table 3.3 Price, Quantity Demanded, and Quantity Supplied</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark177" id="bookmark179" class="s34">Remember this: When two lines on a diagram cross, this intersection usually means something. The point where the supply curve (S) and the demand curve (D) cross, designated by point E in</a>
<a href="#bookmark177" class="a">Figure</a> <span
class="s54">3.4</span>, is called the <strong>equilibrium</strong>. The
<strong>equilibrium price</strong> is the only price where the plans of consumers
and the plans of producers agree—that is, where the amount of the
product consumers want to buy (quantity demanded) is equal to the
amount producers want to sell (quantity supplied). Economists call
this common quantity the <strong>equilibrium quantity</strong>. At any other
price, the quantity demanded does not equal the quantity supplied,
so the market is not in equilibrium at that price.<span
id="bookmark180">‌</span><span id="bookmark181">‌</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark177" class="s34">In</a>
<a href="#bookmark177" class="a">Figure</a> 3.4<span class="p">, the
equilibrium price is $1.40 per gallon of gasoline and the
equilibrium quantity is 600 million gallons. If you had only the
demand and supply schedules, and not the graph, you could find the
equilibrium by looking for the price level on the tables where the
quantity demanded and the quantity supplied are equal.</span></p>
<p>The word “equilibrium” means “balance.” If a market is at its
equilibrium price and quantity, then it has no reason to move away
from that point. However, if a market is not at equilibrium, then
economic pressures arise to move the market toward the equilibrium
price and the equilibrium quantity.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark177" class="s34">Imagine, for example, that the price of a gallon of gasoline was above the equilibrium price—that is, instead of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1.40 per gallon, the price is \)</span>1.80 per gallon. The dashed horizontal line at the price of $1.80 in</a>
<a href="#bookmark177" class="a">Figure 3.4</a> <span
class="p">illustrates this above equilibrium price. At this higher
price, the quantity demanded drops from 600 to 500. This decline in
quantity reflects how consumers react to the higher price by finding
ways to use less gasoline.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark182">Moreover, at this higher price of $1.80, the
quantity of gasoline supplied rises from the 600 to 680, as the
higher price makes it more profitable for gasoline producers to
expand their output. Now, consider how quantity demanded and
quantity supplied are related at this above-equilibrium price.
Quantity demanded has fallen to 500 gallons, while quantity supplied
has risen to 680 gallons. In fact, at any above-equilibrium price,
the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded. We call this
an</span> <strong>excess supply</strong> or a <strong>surplus</strong>.</p>
<p>With a surplus, gasoline accumulates at gas stations, in tanker
trucks, in pipelines, and at oil refineries. This accumulation puts
pressure on gasoline sellers. If a surplus remains unsold, those
firms involved in making and selling gasoline are not receiving
enough cash to pay their workers and to cover their expenses. In
this situation, some producers and sellers will want to cut prices,
because it is better to sell at a lower price than not to sell at
all. Once some sellers start cutting prices, others will follow to
avoid losing sales. These price reductions in turn will stimulate a
higher quantity demanded. Therefore, if the price is above the
equilibrium level, incentives built into the structure of demand and
supply will create pressures for the price to fall toward the
equilibrium.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark177" class="s34">Now suppose that the price is below its equilibrium level at $1.20 per gallon, as the dashed horizontal line at this price in</a>
<a href="#bookmark177" class="a">Figure 3.4</a> <span
class="p">shows. At this lower price, the quantity demanded
increases from 600 to 700 as drivers take longer trips, spend more
minutes warming up the car in the driveway in wintertime, stop
sharing rides to work, and buy larger cars that get fewer miles to
the gallon. However, the below-equilibrium price reduces gasoline
producers’ incentives to produce and sell gasoline, and the quantity
supplied falls from 600 to 550.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark183">When the price is below equilibrium, there
is</span> <strong>excess demand</strong>, or a
<strong>shortage</strong><a href="#bookmark226" class="s34">—that is, at the given price the quantity demanded, which has been stimulated by the lower price, now exceeds the quantity supplied, which had been depressed by the lower price. In this situation, eager gasoline buyers mob the gas stations, only to find many stations running short of fuel. Oil companies and gas stations recognize that they have an opportunity to make higher profits by selling what gasoline they have at a higher price. As a result, the price rises toward the equilibrium level. Read</a>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Identify equilibrium price and quantity through the four-step
process</p></li>
<li><p>Graph equilibrium price and quantity</p></li>

</ul>
<p>Let’s begin this discussion with a single economic event. It might
be an event that affects demand, like a change in income,
population, tastes, prices of substitutes or complements, or
expectations about future prices. It might be an event that affects
supply, like a change in natural conditions, input prices, or
technology, or government policies that affect production. How does
this economic event affect equilibrium price and quantity? We will
analyze this question using a four-step process.</p>
<p>Step 1. Draw a demand and supply model before the economic change
took place. To establish the model requires four standard pieces of
information: The law of demand, which tells us the slope of the
demand curve; the law of supply, which gives us the slope of the
supply curve; the shift variables for demand; and the shift
variables for supply. From this model, find the initial equilibrium
values for price and quantity.</p>
<p>Step 2. Decide whether the economic change you are analyzing affects
demand or supply. In other words, does the</p>
<p>event refer to something in the list of demand factors or supply
factors?</p>
<p>Step 3. Decide whether the effect on demand or supply causes the
curve to shift to the right or to the left, and sketch the new
demand or supply curve on the diagram. In other words, does the
event increase or decrease the amount consumers want to buy or
producers want to sell?</p>
<p>Step 4. Identify the new equilibrium and then compare the original
equilibrium price and quantity to the new equilibrium price and
quantity.</p>
<p>Let’s consider one example that involves a shift in supply and one
that involves a shift in demand. Then we will consider an example
where both supply and demand shift.</p>
<p>Good Weather for Salmon Fishing</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark211" class="s34">Supposed that during the summer of 2015, weather conditions were excellent for commercial salmon fishing off the California coast. Heavy rains meant higher than normal levels of water in the rivers, which helps the salmon to breed. Slightly cooler ocean temperatures stimulated the growth of plankton, the microscopic organisms at the bottom of the ocean food chain, providing everything in the ocean with a hearty food supply. The ocean stayed calm during fishing season, so commercial fishing operations did not lose many days to bad weather. How did these climate conditions affect the quantity and price of salmon?</a>

<p>Table 3.6 Salmon Fishing</p>
<p>Step 1. Draw a demand and supply model to illustrate the market for
salmon in the year before the good weather conditions began. The
demand curve D<span class="s60">0</span> and the supply curve S<span
class="s60">0</span> show that the original equilibrium price is
$3.25 per pound and the original equilibrium quantity is 250,000
fish. (This price per pound is what commercial buyers pay at the
fishing docks. What consumers pay at the grocery is higher.)</p>
<p>Step 2. Did the economic event affect supply or demand? Good weather
is an example of a natural condition that affects supply.</p>
<p>Step 3. Was the effect on supply an increase or a decrease? Good
weather is a change in natural conditions that increases the
quantity supplied at any given price. The supply curve shifts to the
right, moving from the original supply curve S<span
class="s60">0</span> to the new supply curve S<span
class="s60">1</span><a href="#bookmark211" class="s34">, which</a>
<a href="#bookmark211" class="a">Figure 3.16</a><span class="s54">
</span><a href="#bookmark212" class="s34">and</a>
<a href="#bookmark212" class="a">Table 3.6</a><span class="s54">
</span>show.</p>
<p>Step 4. Compare the new equilibrium price and quantity to the
original equilibrium. At the new equilibrium E<span
class="s60">1</span>, the equilibrium price falls from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3.25 to
\)</span>2.50, but the equilibrium quantity increases from 250,000 to
550,000 salmon. Notice that the equilibrium quantity demanded
increased, even though the demand curve did not move.</p>
<p>In short, good weather conditions increased supply of the California
commercial salmon. The result was a higher equilibrium quantity of
salmon bought and sold in the market at a lower price.</p>
<p>Newspapers and the Internet</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark214" id="bookmark213" class="s34">According to the Pew Research Center for People and the Press, increasingly more people, especially younger people, are obtaining their news from online and digital sources. The majority of U.S. adults now own smartphones or tablets, and most of those Americans say they use them in part to access the news. From 2004 to 2012, the share of Americans who reported obtaining their news from digital sources increased from 24% to 39%. How has this affected consumption of print news media, and radio and television news?</a>
<a href="#bookmark214" class="a">Figure 3.17</a> <span class="p">and
the text below illustrates using the four-step analysis to answer
this question.</span></p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_077.jpg" width="305" height="278" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark214">Figure 3.17 The Print News Market: A
Four-Step Analysis</span> <span class="s37">A change in tastes from
print news sources to digital sources results in a leftward shift in
demand for the former. The result is a decrease in both equilibrium
price and quantity.</span></p>
<p>Step 1. Develop a demand and supply model to think about what the
market looked like before the event. The demand curve D<span
class="s60">0</span> and the supply curve S<span
class="s60">0</span> show the original relationships. In this case,
we perform the analysis without</p>
<p>specific numbers on the price and quantity axis.</p>
<p>Step 2. Did the described change affect supply or demand? A change
in tastes, from traditional news sources (print, radio, and
television) to digital sources, caused a change in demand for the
former.</p>
<p>Step 3. Was the effect on demand positive or negative? A shift to
digital news sources will tend to mean a lower quantity demanded of
traditional news sources at every given price, causing the demand
curve for print and other traditional news sources to shift to the
left, from D<span class="s60">0</span> to D<span
class="s60">1</span>.</p>
<p>Step 4. Compare the new equilibrium price and quantity to the
original equilibrium price. The new equilibrium (E<span
class="s60">1</span>) occurs at a lower quantity and a lower price
than the original equilibrium (E<span class="s60">0</span>).</p>
<p>The decline in print news reading predates 2004. Print newspaper
circulation peaked in 1973 and has declined since then due to
competition from television and radio news. In 1991, 55% of
Americans indicated they received their news from print sources,
while only 29% did so in 2012. Radio news has followed a similar
path in recent decades, with the share of Americans obtaining their
news from radio declining from 54% in 1991 to 33% in 2012.
Television news has held its own over the last 15 years, with a
market share staying in the mid to upper fifties. What does this
suggest for the future, given that two-thirds of Americans under 30
years old say they do not obtain their news from television at all?</p>
<p>The Interconnections and Speed of Adjustment in Real Markets</p>
<p>In the real world, many factors that affect demand and supply can
change all at once. For example, the demand for cars might increase
because of rising incomes and population, and it might decrease
because of rising gasoline prices (a complementary good). Likewise,
the supply of cars might increase because of innovative new
technologies that reduce the cost of car production, and it might
decrease as a result of new government regulations requiring the
installation of costly pollution-control technology.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark215">Moreover, rising incomes and population or
changes in gasoline prices will affect many markets, not just cars.
How can an economist sort out all these interconnected events? The
answer lies in the</span> <em>ceteris paribus</em> assumption. Look at how
each economic event affects each market, one event at a time,
holding all else constant. Then combine the analyses to see the net
effect.</p>
<p>A Combined Example</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark216" class="s34">The U.S. Postal Service is facing difficult challenges. Compensation for postal workers tends to increase most years due to cost-of-living increases. At the same time, increasingly more people are using email, text, and other digital message forms such as Facebook and Twitter to communicate with friends and others. What does this suggest about the continued viability of the Postal Service?</a>
<a href="#bookmark216" class="a">Figure 3.18</a> <span class="p">and
the text below illustrate this using the four-step analysis to
answer this question.</span></p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_078.jpg" width="619" height="301" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark216">Figure 3.18 Higher Compensation for Postal
Workers: A Four-Step Analysis</span> <span class="s37">(a) Higher
labor compensation causes a leftward shift in the supply curve, a
decrease in the equilibrium quantity, and an increase in the
equilibrium price. (b) A change in tastes away from Postal Services
causes a leftward shift in the demand curve, a decrease in the
equilibrium quantity, and a decrease in the equilibrium
price.</span></p>
<p>Since this problem involves two disturbances, we need two four-step
analyses, the first to analyze the effects of higher compensation
for postal workers, the second to analyze the effects of many people
switching from “snail mail” to email and other digital messages.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark216" class="a">Figure 3.18</a> <span class="p">(a)
shows the shift in supply discussed in the following steps.</span></p>
<p>Step 1. Draw a demand and supply model to illustrate what the market
for the U.S. Postal Service looked like before this scenario starts.
The demand curve D<span class="s60">0</span> and the supply curve
S<span class="s60">0</span> show the original relationships.</p>
<p>Step 2. Did the described change affect supply or demand? Labor
compensation is a cost of production. A change in production costs
caused a change in supply for the Postal Service.</p>
<p>Step 3. Was the effect on supply positive or negative? Higher labor
compensation leads to a lower quantity supplied of postal services
at every given price, causing the supply curve for postal services
to shift to the left, from S<span class="s60">0</span> to S<span
class="s60">1</span>.</p>
<p>Step 4. Compare the new equilibrium price and quantity to the
original equilibrium price. The new equilibrium (E<span
class="s60">1</span>) occurs at a lower quantity and a higher price
than the original equilibrium (E<span class="s60">0</span>).</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark216" class="a">Figure 3.18</a> <span class="p">(b)
shows the shift in demand in the following steps.</span></p>
<p>Step 1. Draw a demand and supply model to illustrate what the market
for U.S. Postal Services looked like before this scenario starts.
The demand curve D<span class="s60">0</span> and the supply curve
S<span class="s60">0</span> show the original relationships. Note
that this diagram is independent from the diagram in panel (a).</p>
<p>Step 2. Did the change described affect supply or demand? A change
in tastes away from snail mail toward digital messages will cause a
change in demand for the Postal Service.</p>
<p>Step 3. Was the effect on demand positive or negative? A change in
tastes away from snailmail toward digital messages causes lower
quantity demanded of postal services at every given price, causing
the demand curve for postal services to shift to the left, from
D<span class="s60">0</span> to D<span class="s60">1</span>.</p>
<p>Step 4. Compare the new equilibrium price and quantity to the
original equilibrium price. The new equilibrium (E<span
class="s60">2</span>) occurs at a lower quantity and a lower price
than the original equilibrium (E<span class="s60">0</span>).</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark217" class="s34">The final step in a scenario where both supply and demand shift is to combine the two individual analyses to determine what happens to the equilibrium quantity and price. Graphically, we superimpose the previous two diagrams one on top of the other, as in</a>
<a href="#bookmark217" class="a">Figure</a> 3.19<span
class="p">.</span></p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_079.jpg" width="288" height="282" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark217">Figure 3.19 Combined Effect of Decreased
Demand and Decreased Supply</span> <span class="s37">Supply and
demand shifts cause changes in equilibrium price and
quantity.</span></p>
<p>Following are the results:</p>
<p>Effect on Quantity: The effect of higher labor compensation on
Postal Services because it raises the cost of production is to
decrease the equilibrium quantity. The effect of a change in tastes
away from snail mail is to decrease the equilibrium quantity. Since
both shifts are to the left, the overall impact is a decrease in the
equilibrium quantity of Postal Services (Q<span
class="s60">3</span>). This is easy to see graphically, since Q<span
class="s60">3</span> is to the left of Q<span class="s60">0</span>.</p>
<p>Effect on Price: The overall effect on price is more complicated.
The effect of higher labor compensation on Postal Services, because
it raises the cost of production, is to increase the equilibrium
price. The effect of a change in tastes away from snail mail is to
decrease the equilibrium price. Since the two effects are in
opposite directions, unless we know the magnitudes of the two
effects, the overall effect is unclear. This is not unusual. When
both curves shift, typically we can determine the overall effect on
price or on quantity, but not on both. In this case, we determined
the overall effect on the equilibrium quantity, but not on the
equilibrium price. In other cases, it might be the opposite.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_080.png" width="624" height="51" alt="image" />
<p>What is the difference between shifts of demand or supply versus
movements along a demand or supply curve?</p>
<p>One common mistake in applying the demand and supply framework is to
confuse the shift of a demand or a supply curve with movement along
a demand or supply curve. As an example, consider a problem that
asks whether a drought will increase or decrease the equilibrium
quantity and equilibrium price of wheat. Lee, a student in an
introductory economics class, might reason:</p>
<p><span id="bookmark218">“Well, it is clear that a drought reduces
supply, so I will shift back the supply curve, as in the shift from
the original supply curve S</span><span class="s63">0</span> to
S<span class="s63">1</span> on the diagram (Shift 1). The
equilibrium moves from E<span class="s63">0</span> to E<span
class="s63">1</span>, the equilibrium quantity is lower and the
equilibrium price is higher. Then, a higher price makes farmers more
likely to supply the good, so the supply curve shifts right, as
shows the shift from S<span class="s63">1</span> to S<span
class="s63">2</span>, shows on the diagram (Shift 2), so that the
equilibrium now moves from E<span class="s63">1</span> to E<span
class="s63">2</span>. The higher price, however, also reduces demand
and so causes demand to shift back, like the shift from the original
demand curve, D<span class="s63">0</span> to D<span
class="s63">1</span> on the diagram (labeled</p>
<p>The next Clear It Up feature focuses on the difference between
shifts of supply or demand and movements along a curve.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_081.png" width="624" height="576" alt="image" />
<p>Shift 3), and the equilibrium moves from E<span class="s63">2</span>
to E<span class="s63">3</span>.”</p>
<p>Figure 3.20 Shifts of Demand or Supply versus Movements along a
Demand or Supply Curve <span class="s37">A shift in one curve never
causes a shift in the other curve. Rather, a shift in one curve
causes a movement along the second curve.</span></p>
<p>At about this point, Lee suspects that this answer is headed down
the wrong path. Think about what might be wrong with Lee’s logic,
and then read the answer that follows.</p>
<p><em>Answer:</em> Lee’s first step is correct: that is, a drought shifts
back the supply curve of wheat and leads to a prediction of a lower
equilibrium quantity and a higher equilibrium price. This
corresponds to a movement along the original demand curve (D<span
class="s63">0</span>), from E<span class="s63">0</span> to E<span
class="s63">1</span>. The rest of Lee’s argument is wrong, because
it mixes up shifts in supply with quantity supplied, and shifts in
demand with quantity demanded. A higher or lower price never shifts
the supply curve, as suggested by the shift in supply from S<span
class="s63">1</span> to S<span class="s63">2</span>. Instead, a
price change leads to a movement along a given supply curve.
Similarly, a higher or lower price never shifts a demand curve, as
suggested in the shift from D<span class="s63">0</span> to D<span
class="s63">1</span>. Instead, a price change leads to a movement
along a given demand curve. Remember, a change in the price of a
good never causes the demand or supply curve for that good to shift.</p>
<p>Think carefully about the timeline of events: What happens first,
what happens next? What is cause, what is effect? If you keep the
order right, you are more likely to get the analysis correct.</p>
<p>In the four-step analysis of how economic events affect equilibrium
price and quantity, the movement from the old to the new equilibrium
seems immediate. As a practical matter, however, prices and
quantities often do not zoom straight to equilibrium. More
realistically, when an economic event causes demand or supply to
shift, prices and quantities set off in the general direction of
equilibrium. Even as they are moving toward one new equilibrium, a
subsequent change in demand or supply often pushes prices toward
another equilibrium.</p>

<p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Explain price controls, price ceilings, and price floors</p></li>
<li><p>Analyze demand and supply as a social adjustment mechanism</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To this point in the chapter, we have been assuming that markets are
free, that is, they operate with no government intervention. In this
section, we will explore the outcomes, both anticipated and
otherwise, when government does intervene in a market either to
prevent the price of some good or service from rising “too high” or
to prevent the price of some good or service from falling “too low”.</p>
<p>Economists believe there are a small number of fundamental
principles that explain how economic agents respond in different
situations. Two of these principles, which we have already
introduced, are the laws of demand and supply.</p>
<p>Governments can pass laws affecting market outcomes, but no law can
negate these economic principles. Rather, the principles will become
apparent in sometimes unexpected ways, which may undermine the
intent of the government policy. This is one of the major
conclusions of this section.</p>
<p>Controversy sometimes surrounds the prices and quantities
established by demand and supply, especially for products that are
considered necessities. In some cases, discontent over prices turns
into public pressure on politicians, who may then pass legislation
to prevent a certain price from climbing “too high” or falling “too
low.”</p>
<p>The demand and supply model shows how people and firms will react to
the incentives that these laws provide to control prices, in ways
that will often lead to undesirable consequences. Alternative policy
tools can often achieve the desired goals of price control laws,
while avoiding at least some of their costs and tradeoffs.</p>
<p>Price Ceilings</p>
<p><span id="bookmark220">Laws that government enact to regulate prices
are called</span> <strong>price controls</strong>. Price controls come in two
flavors. A <strong>price ceiling</strong> keeps a price from rising above a
certain level (the “ceiling”), while a <strong>price floor</strong> keeps a price
from falling below a given level (the “floor”). This section uses
the demand and supply framework to analyze price ceilings. The next
section discusses price floors.<span id="bookmark221">‌</span></p>
<p>A price ceiling is a legal maximum price that one pays for some good
or service. A government imposes price ceilings in order to keep the
price of some necessary good or service affordable. For example, in
2005 during Hurricane Katrina, the price of bottled water increased
above $5 per gallon. As a result, many people called for price
controls on bottled water to prevent the price from rising so high.
In this particular case, the government did not impose a price
ceiling, but there are other examples of where price ceilings did
occur.</p>
<p>In many markets for goods and services, demanders outnumber
suppliers. Consumers, who are also potential voters, sometimes unite
behind a political proposal to hold down a certain price. In some
cities, such as Albany, renters have pressed political leaders to
pass rent control laws, a price ceiling that usually works by
stating that landlords can raise rents by only a certain maximum
percentage each year. Some of the best examples of rent control
occur in urban areas such as New York, Washington D.C., or San
Francisco.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark222" class="s34">Rent control becomes a politically hot topic when rents begin to rise rapidly. Everyone needs an affordable place to live. Perhaps a change in tastes makes a certain suburb or town a more popular place to live. Perhaps locally-based businesses expand, bringing higher incomes and more people into the area. Such changes can cause a change in the demand for rental housing, as</a>
<a href="#bookmark222" class="a">Figure 3.21</a><span class="s54">
</span>illustrates. The original equilibrium (E<span
class="s60">0</span>) lies at the intersection of supply curve
S<span class="s60">0</span> and demand curve D<span
class="s60">0</span><a href="#bookmark223" class="s34">, corresponding to an equilibrium price of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(500 and an equilibrium quantity of 15,000 units of rental housing. The effect of greater income or a change in tastes is to shift the demand curve for rental housing to the right, as the data in&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;#bookmark223&quot; class=&quot;a&quot;&gt;Table 3.7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s54&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;shows and the shift from D&lt;span class=&quot;s60&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; to
D&lt;span class=&quot;s60&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; on the graph. In this market, at the new
equilibrium E&lt;span class=&quot;s60&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;, the price of a rental unit
would rise to \)</span>600 and the equilibrium quantity would increase to
17,000 units.</p>

<p>Table 3.7 Rent Control</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark222" class="s34">Suppose that a city government passes a rent control law to keep the price at the original equilibrium of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(500 for a typical apartment. In&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;#bookmark222&quot; class=&quot;a&quot;&gt;Figure&lt;/a&gt; 3.21&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,
the horizontal line at the price of \)</span>500 shows the legally fixed
maximum price set by the rent control law. However, the underlying
forces that shifted the demand curve to the right are still there.
At that price (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(500), the quantity supplied remains at the same
15,000 rental units, but the quantity demanded is 19,000 rental
units. In other words, the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity
supplied, so there is a shortage of rental housing. One of the
ironies of price ceilings is that while the price ceiling was
intended to help renters, there are actually fewer apartments rented
out under the price ceiling (15,000 rental units) than would be the
case at the market rent of \)</span>600 (17,000 rental units).</span></p>
<p>Price ceilings do not simply benefit renters at the expense of
landlords. Rather, some renters (or potential renters) lose their
housing as landlords convert apartments to co-ops and condos. Even
when the housing remains in the rental market, landlords tend to
spend less on maintenance and on essentials like heating, cooling,
hot water, and lighting. The first rule of economics is you do not
get something for nothing—everything has an opportunity cost. Thus,
if renters obtain “cheaper” housing than the market requires, they
tend to also end up with lower quality housing.</p>
<p>Price ceilings are enacted in an attempt to keep prices low for
those who need the product. However, when the market price is not
allowed to rise to the equilibrium level, quantity demanded exceeds
quantity supplied, and thus a shortage occurs. Those who manage to
purchase the product at the lower price given by the price ceiling
will benefit, but sellers of the product will suffer, along with
those who are not able to purchase the product at all. Quality is
also likely to deteriorate.</p>
<p>Price Floors</p>
<p>A price floor is the lowest price that one can legally pay for some
good or service. Perhaps the best-known example</p>
<p>of a price floor is the minimum wage, which is based on the view
that someone working full time should be able to afford a basic
standard of living. The federal minimum wage in 2016 was $7.25 per
hour, although some states and localities have a higher minimum
wage. The federal minimum wage yields an annual income for a single
person of</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(15,080, which is slightly higher than the Federal poverty line of
\)</span>11,880. As the cost of living rises over time, the Congress
periodically raises the federal minimum wage.</p>
<p>Price floors are sometimes called “price supports,” because they
support a price by preventing it from falling below a certain level.
Around the world, many countries have passed laws to create
agricultural price supports. Farm prices and thus farm incomes
fluctuate, sometimes widely. Even if, on average, farm incomes are
adequate, some years they can be quite low. The purpose of price
supports is to prevent these swings.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark224">The most common way price supports work is
that the government enters the market and buys up the product,
adding to demand to keep prices higher than they otherwise would be.
According to the Common Agricultural Policy reform passed in 2013,
the European Union (EU) will spend about 60 billion euros per year,
or 67 billion dollars per year (with the November 2016 exchange
rate), or roughly 38% of the EU budget, on price supports for
Europe’s farmers from 2014 to 2020.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark225" class="a">Figure 3.22</a><span class="s54">
</span>illustrates the effects of a government program that assures
a price above the equilibrium by focusing on the market for wheat in
Europe. In the absence of government intervention, the price would
adjust so that the quantity supplied would equal the quantity
demanded at the equilibrium point E<span class="s60">0</span>, with
price P<span class="s60">0</span> and quantity Q<span
class="s60">0</span>. However, policies to keep prices high for
farmers keeps the price above what would have been the market
equilibrium level—the price Pf shown by the dashed horizontal line
in the diagram. The result is a quantity supplied in excess of the
quantity demanded (Qd). When quantity supplied exceeds quantity
demanded, a surplus exists.</p>
<p>Economists estimate that the high-income areas of the world,
including the United States, Europe, and Japan, spend roughly $1
billion per day in supporting their farmers. If the government is
willing to purchase the excess supply (or to provide payments for
others to purchase it), then farmers will benefit from the price
floor, but taxpayers and consumers of food will pay the costs.
Agricultural economists and policy makers have offered numerous
proposals for reducing farm subsidies. In many countries, however,
political support for subsidies for farmers remains strong. This is
either because the population views this as supporting the
traditional rural way of life or because of industry’s lobbying
power of the agro-business.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Contrast consumer surplus, producer surplus, and social surplus</p></li>
<li><p>Explain why price floors and price ceilings can be inefficient</p></li>
<li><p>Analyze demand and supply as a social adjustment mechanism</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span id="bookmark227">The familiar demand and supply diagram holds
within it the concept of economic efficiency. One typical way that
economists define efficiency is when it is impossible to improve the
situation of one party without imposing a cost on another.
Conversely, if a situation is inefficient, it becomes possible to
benefit at least one party without imposing costs on
others.</span><span id="bookmark228">‌</span></p>
<p>Efficiency in the demand and supply model has the same basic
meaning: The economy is getting as much benefit as possible from its
scarce resources and all the possible gains from trade have been
achieved. In other words, the optimal amount of each good and
service is produced and consumed.</p>
<p>Consumer Surplus, Producer Surplus, Social Surplus</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark231" id="bookmark229" class="s34">Consider a market for tablet computers, as</a>
<a href="#bookmark231" class="a">Figure 3.23</a> <span
class="p">shows. The equilibrium price is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(80 and the equilibrium
quantity is 28 million. To see the benefits to consumers, look at
the segment of the demand curve above the equilibrium point and to
the left. This portion of the demand curve shows that at least some
demanders would have been willing to pay more than \)</span>80 for a
tablet.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark230">For example, point J shows that if the price
were <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(90, 20 million tablets would be sold. Those consumers who
would have been willing to pay \)</span>90 for a tablet based on the utility
they expect to receive from it, but who were able to pay the
equilibrium price of $80, clearly received a benefit beyond what
they had to pay. Remember, the demand curve traces consumers’
willingness to pay for different quantities. The amount that
individuals would have been willing to pay, minus the amount that
they actually paid, is called</span> <strong>consumer surplus</strong>. Consumer
surplus is the area labeled F—that is, the area above the market
price and below the demand curve.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_084.jpg" width="296" height="272" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark231">Figure 3.23 Consumer and Producer
Surplus</span> <span class="s37">The somewhat triangular area
labeled by F shows the area of consumer surplus, which shows that
the equilibrium price in the market was less than what many of the
consumers were willing to pay. Point J on the demand curve shows
that, even at the price of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(90, consumers would have been willing to
purchase a quantity of 20 million. The somewhat triangular area
labeled by G shows the area of producer surplus, which shows that
the equilibrium price received in the market was more than what many
of the producers were willing to accept for their products. For
example, point K on the supply curve shows that at a price of \)</span>45,
firms would have been willing to supply a quantity of 14
million.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark231" class="s34">The supply curve shows the quantity that firms are willing to supply at each price. For example, point K in</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark231">Figure</a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark231" id="bookmark232" class="a">3.23</a> <span
class="p">illustrates that, at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(45, firms would still have been
willing to supply a quantity of 14 million. Those producers who
would have been willing to supply the tablets at \)</span>45, but who were
instead able to charge the equilibrium price of $80, clearly
received an extra benefit beyond what they required to supply the
product. The amount that a seller is paid for a good minus the
seller’s actual cost is called </span><span class="s31">producer
surplus</span><a href="#bookmark231" class="s34">. In</a>
<a href="#bookmark231" class="a">Figure</a> 3.23<span class="p">,
producer surplus is the area labeled G—that is, the area between the
market price and the segment of the supply curve below the
equilibrium.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark233">The sum of consumer surplus and producer
surplus is</span> <strong>social surplus</strong>, also referred to as <strong>economic
surplus</strong> or <strong>total
surplus</strong><a href="#bookmark231" class="s34">. In</a>
<a href="#bookmark231" class="a">Figure 3.23</a><span class="s54">
</span>we show social surplus as the area F + G. Social surplus is
larger at equilibrium quantity and price than it would be at any
other quantity. This demonstrates the economic efficiency of the
market equilibrium. In addition, at the efficient level of output,
it is impossible to produce greater consumer surplus without
reducing producer surplus, and it is impossible to produce greater
producer surplus without reducing consumer surplus.</p>
<p>Inefficiency of Price Floors and Price Ceilings</p>
<p>The imposition of a price floor or a price ceiling will prevent a
market from adjusting to its equilibrium price and quantity, and
thus will create an inefficient outcome. However, there is an
additional twist here. Along with creating inefficiency, price
floors and ceilings will also transfer some consumer surplus to
producers, or some producer surplus to consumers.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark237" class="s34">Imagine that several firms develop a promising but expensive new drug for treating back pain. If this therapy is left to the market, the equilibrium price will be <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(600 per month and 20,000 people will use the drug, as shown in&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;#bookmark237&quot; class=&quot;a&quot;&gt;Figure 3.24&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span
class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(a). The original level of consumer surplus is T + U and
producer surplus is V + W + X. However, the government decides to
impose a price ceiling of \)</span>400 to make the drug more affordable. At
this price ceiling, firms in the market now produce only
15,000.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark234">As a result, two changes occur. First, an
inefficient outcome occurs and the total surplus of society is
reduced. The loss in social surplus that occurs when the economy
produces at an inefficient quantity is called</span> <strong>deadweight
loss</strong><a href="#bookmark237" class="s34">. In a very real sense, it is like money thrown away that benefits no one. In</a>
<a href="#bookmark237" class="a">Figure 3.24</a><span class="s54">
</span>(a), the deadweight loss is the area U + W. When deadweight
loss exists, it is possible for both consumer and producer surplus
to be higher, in this case because the price control is blocking
some suppliers and demanders from transactions they would both be
willing to make.<span id="bookmark235">‌</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark236">A second change from the price ceiling is
that some of the producer surplus is transferred to consumers. After
the price ceiling is imposed, the new consumer surplus is T + V,
while the new producer surplus is X. In other words, the price
ceiling transfers the area of surplus (V) from producers to
consumers. Note that the gain to consumers is less than the loss to
producers, which is just another way of seeing the deadweight
loss.</span></p>

<p><a href="#bookmark237" class="a">Figure 3.24</a> <span class="p">(b)
shows a price floor example using a string of struggling movie
theaters, all in the same city. The current equilibrium is $8 per
movie ticket, with 1,800 people attending movies. The original
consumer surplus is G</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark238">+ H + J, and producer surplus is I + K. The
city government is worried that movie theaters will go out of
business, reducing the entertainment options available to citizens,
so it decides to impose a price floor of $12 per ticket. As a
result, the quantity demanded of movie tickets falls to 1,400. The
new consumer surplus is G, and the new producer surplus is H + I. In
effect, the price floor causes the area H to be transferred from
consumer to producer surplus, but also causes a deadweight loss of
J + K.</span></p>
<p>This analysis shows that a price ceiling, like a law establishing
rent controls, will transfer some producer surplus to
consumers—which helps to explain why consumers often favor them.
Conversely, a price floor like a guarantee that farmers will receive
a certain price for their crops will transfer some consumer surplus
to producers, which explains why producers often favor them.
However, both price floors and price ceilings block some
transactions that buyers and sellers would have been willing to
make, and creates deadweight loss. Removing such barriers, so that
prices and quantities can adjust to their equilibrium level, will
increase the economy’s social surplus.</p>
<p>Demand and Supply as a Social Adjustment Mechanism</p>
<p><span id="bookmark239">The demand and supply model emphasizes that
prices are not set only by demand or only by supply, but by the
interaction between the two. In 1890, the famous economist Alfred
Marshall wrote that asking whether supply or demand determined a
price was like arguing “whether it is the upper or the under blade
of a pair of scissors that cuts a piece of paper.” The answer is
that both blades of the demand and supply scissors are always
involved.</span></p>
<p>The adjustments of equilibrium price and quantity in a
market-oriented economy often occur without much government
direction or oversight. If the coffee crop in Brazil suffers a
terrible frost, then the supply curve of coffee shifts to the left
and the price of coffee rises. Some people—call them the coffee
addicts—continue to drink coffee and pay the higher price. Others
switch to tea or soft drinks. No government commission is needed to
figure out how to adjust coffee prices, which companies will be
allowed to process the remaining supply, which supermarkets in which
cities will get how much coffee to sell, or which consumers will
ultimately be allowed to drink the brew. Such adjustments in
response to price changes happen all the time in a market economy,
often so smoothly and rapidly that we barely notice them.</p>
<p>Think for a moment of all the seasonal foods that are available and
inexpensive at certain times of the year, like fresh corn in
midsummer, but more expensive at other times of the year. People
alter their diets and restaurants alter their menus in response to
these fluctuations in prices without fuss or fanfare. For both the
U.S. economy and the world</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_086.png" width="624" height="482" alt="image" />
<p>economy as a whole, markets—that is, demand and supply—are the
primary social mechanism for answering the basic questions about
what is produced, how it is produced, and for whom it is produced.</p>
<p>Why Can We Not Get Enough of Organic?</p>
<p>Organic food is grown without synthetic pesticides, chemical
fertilizers or genetically modified seeds. In recent decades, the
demand for organic products has increased dramatically. The Organic
Trade Association reported sales increased from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1 billion in 1990
to \)</span>35.1 billion in 2013, more than 90% of which were sales of food
products.</p>
<p>Why, then, are organic foods more expensive than their conventional
counterparts? The answer is a clear application of the theories of
supply and demand. As people have learned more about the harmful
effects of chemical fertilizers, growth hormones, pesticides and the
like from large-scale factory farming, our tastes and preferences
for safer, organic foods have increased. This change in tastes has
been reinforced by increases in income, which allow people to
purchase pricier products, and has made organic foods more
mainstream. This has led to an increased demand for organic foods.
Graphically, the demand curve has shifted right, and we have moved
up the supply curve as producers have responded to the higher prices
by supplying a greater quantity.</p>
<p>In addition to the movement along the supply curve, we have also had
an increase in the number of farmers converting to organic farming
over time. This is represented by a shift to the right of the supply
curve. Since both demand and supply have shifted to the right, the
resulting equilibrium quantity of organic foods is definitely
higher, but the price will only fall when the increase in supply is
larger than the increase in demand. We may need more time before we
see lower prices in organic foods. Since the production costs of
these foods may remain higher than conventional farming, because
organic fertilizers and pest management techniques are more
expensive, they may never fully catch up with the lower prices of
non-organic foods.</p>
<p>As a final, specific example: The Environmental Working Group’s
“Dirty Dozen” list of fruits and vegetables, which test high for
pesticide residue even after washing, was released in April 2013.
The inclusion of strawberries on the list has led to an increase in
demand for organic strawberries, resulting in both a higher
equilibrium price and quantity of sales.</p>

<p>KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY</p>
<ol>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark160" class="a">Demand, Supply, and Equilibrium in Markets for Goods and</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark160">Services</a></p>
<p>A demand schedule is a table that shows the quantity demanded at
different prices in the market. A demand curve shows the
relationship between quantity demanded and price in a given
market on a graph. The law of demand states that a higher price
typically leads to a lower quantity demanded.</p>
<p>A supply schedule is a table that shows the quantity supplied at
different prices in the market. A supply curve shows the
relationship between quantity supplied and price on a graph. The
law of supply says that a higher price typically leads to a
higher quantity supplied.</p>
<p>The equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity occur where the
supply and demand curves cross. The equilibrium occurs where the
quantity demanded is equal to the quantity supplied. If the
price is below the equilibrium level, then the quantity demanded
will exceed the quantity supplied. Excess demand or a shortage
will exist. If the price is above the equilibrium level, then
the quantity supplied will exceed the quantity demanded. Excess
supply or a surplus will exist. In either case, economic
pressures will push the price toward the equilibrium level.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark184" class="a">Shifts in Demand and Supply for Goods and</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark184">Services</a></p>
<p>Economists often use the <em>ceteris paribus</em> or “other things
being equal” assumption: while examining the economic impact of
one event, all other factors remain unchanged for analysis
purposes. Factors that can shift the demand curve for goods and
services, causing a different quantity to be demanded at any
given price, include changes in tastes, population, income,
prices of substitute or complement goods, and expectations about
future conditions and prices. Factors that can shift the supply
curve for goods and services, causing a different quantity to be
supplied at any given price, include input prices, natural
conditions, changes in technology, and government taxes,
regulations, or subsidies.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark210" class="a">Changes in Equilibrium Price and Quantity: The Four-Step</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark210">Process</a></p>
<p>When using the supply and demand framework to think about how an
event will affect the equilibrium price and quantity, proceed
through four steps: (1) sketch a supply and demand diagram to
think about what the market looked like before the event; (2)
decide whether the event will affect supply or demand; (3)
decide whether the effect on supply or demand is negative or
positive, and draw the appropriate shifted supply or demand
curve; (4) compare the new equilibrium price and quantity to the
original ones.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark219" class="a">Price Ceilings and Price</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark219">Floors</a></p>
<p>Price ceilings prevent a price from rising above a certain
level. When a price ceiling is set below the equilibrium price,
quantity demanded will exceed quantity supplied, and excess
demand or shortages will result. Price floors prevent a price
from falling below a certain level. When a price floor is set
above the equilibrium price, quantity supplied will exceed
quantity demanded, and excess supply or surpluses will result.
Price floors and price ceilings often lead to unintended
consequences.</p>

<p>Consumer surplus is the gap between the price that consumers are willing
to pay, based on their preferences, and the market equilibrium price.
Producer surplus is the gap between the price for which producers are
willing to sell a product, based on their costs, and the market
equilibrium price. Social surplus is the sum of consumer surplus and
producer surplus. Total surplus is larger at the equilibrium quantity
and price than it will be at any other quantity and price. Deadweight
loss is loss in total surplus that occurs when the economy produces at
an inefficient quantity.</p>

<p>Baby Boomers Come of Age</p>
<p>The Census Bureau reports that as of 2013, 20% of the U.S. population
was over 60 years old, which means that almost 63 million people are
reaching an age when they will need increased medical care.</p>
<p>The baby boomer population, the group born between 1946 and 1964, is
comprised of approximately</p>
<p>74 million people who have just reached retirement age. As this
population grows older, they will be faced with common healthcare issues
such as heart conditions, arthritis, and Alzheimer’s that may require
hospitalization, long-term, or at-home nursing care. Aging baby boomers
and advances in life-saving and life- extending technologies will
increase the demand for healthcare and nursing. Additionally, the
Affordable Care Act, which expands access to healthcare for millions of
Americans, has further increase the demand, although with the election
of Donald J. Trump, this increase may not be sustained.</p>
<p>According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, registered nursing jobs are
expected to increase by 16% between 2014 and 2024. The median annual
wage of $67,490 (in 2015) is also expected to increase. The BLS
forecasts that 439,000 new nurses will be in demand by 2022.</p>
<p>These data tell us, as economists, that the market for healthcare
professionals, and nurses in particular, will face several challenges.
Our study of supply and demand will help us to analyze what might happen
in the</p>

<span style=" color: #000;">to read a brief note on how marketing
strategies can influence supply and demand of products.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark185">The previous module explored how price
affects the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied. The result
was the demand curve and the supply curve. Price, however, is not
the only factor that influences demand, nor is it the only thing
that influences supply. For example, how is demand for vegetarian
food affected if, say, health concerns cause more consumers to avoid
eating meat? How is the supply of diamonds affected if diamond
producers discover several new diamond mines? What are the major
factors, in addition to the price, that influence demand or
supply?</span></p>
<p>What Factors Affect Demand?</p>
<p>We defined demand as the amount of some product a consumer is
willing and able to purchase at each price. That suggests at least
two factors in addition to price that affect demand. Willingness to
purchase suggests a desire, based on what economists call tastes and
preferences. If you neither need nor want something, you will not
buy it. Ability to purchase suggests that income is important.
Professors are usually able to afford better housing and
transportation than students, because they have more income. Prices
of related goods can affect demand also. If you need a new car, the
price of a Honda may affect your demand for a Ford. Finally, the
size or composition of the population can affect demand. The more
children a family has, the greater their demand for clothing. The
more driving-age children a family has, the greater their demand for
car insurance, and the less for diapers and baby formula.</p>
<p>These factors matter for both individual and market demand as a
whole. Exactly how do these various factors affect demand, and how
do we show the effects graphically? To answer those questions, we
need the <em>ceteris paribus</em> assumption.</p>
<p>The <em>Ceteris Paribus</em> Assumption</p>
<p><span id="bookmark186">A demand curve or a supply curve is a
relationship between two, and only two, variables: quantity on the
horizontal axis and price on the vertical axis. The assumption
behind a demand curve or a supply curve is that no relevant economic
factors, other than the product’s price, are changing. Economists
call this assumption</span> <strong>ceteris paribus</strong>, a Latin phrase
meaning “other things being equal.” Any given demand or supply curve
is based on the <em>ceteris paribus</em> assumption that all else is held
equal. A demand curve or a supply curve is a relationship between
two, and only two, variables when all other variables are kept
constant. If all else is not held equal, then the laws of supply and
demand will not necessarily hold, as the following Clear It Up
feature shows.<span id="bookmark187">‌</span></p>
<p>When does <em>ceteris paribus</em> apply?</p>
<p>We typically apply <em>ceteris paribus</em> when we observe how changes in
price affect demand or supply, but we can apply <em>ceteris paribus</em>
more generally. In the real world, demand and supply depend on more
factors than just price. For example, a consumer’s demand depends on
income and a producer’s supply depends on the cost of producing the
product. How can we analyze the effect on demand or supply if
multiple factors are changing at the same time—say price rises and
income falls? The answer is that we examine the changes one at a
time, assuming the other factors are held constant.</p>
<p>For example, we can say that an increase in the price reduces the
amount consumers will buy (assuming income, and anything else that
affects demand, is unchanged). Additionally, a decrease in income
reduces the amount consumers can afford to buy (assuming price, and
anything else that affects demand, is unchanged). This is what the
<em>ceteris paribus</em> assumption really means. In this particular case,
after we analyze each factor separately, we can combine the results.
The amount consumers buy falls for two reasons: first because of the
higher price and second because of the lower income.</p>

<p>How Does Income Affect Demand?</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark188" class="s34">Let’s use income as an example of how factors other than price affect demand.</a>
<a href="#bookmark188" class="a">Figure 3.5</a><span class="s54">
</span>shows the initial demand for automobiles as D<span
class="s60">0</span>. At point Q, for example, if the price is
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(20,000 per car, the quantity of cars demanded is 18 million. D&lt;span
class=&quot;s60&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; also shows how the quantity of cars demanded
would change as a result of a higher or lower price. For example, if
the price of a car rose to \)</span>22,000, the quantity demanded would
decrease to 17 million, at point R.</p>
<p>The original demand curve D<span class="s60">0</span>, like every
demand curve, is based on the <em>ceteris paribus</em> assumption that no
other economically relevant factors change. Now imagine that the
economy expands in a way that raises the incomes of many people,
making cars more affordable. How will this affect demand? How can we
show this graphically?</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark188" class="s34">Return to</a>
<a href="#bookmark188" class="a">Figure</a> 3.5<span class="p">. The
price of cars is still $20,000, but with higher incomes, the
quantity demanded has now increased to 20 million cars, shown at
point S. As a result of the higher income levels, the demand curve
shifts to the right to the new demand curve D</span><span
class="s60">1</span><a href="#bookmark189" class="s34">, indicating an increase in demand.</a>
<a href="#bookmark189" class="a">Table 3.4</a> <span class="p">shows
clearly that this increased demand would occur at every price, not
just the original one.</span></p>

<p><span id="bookmark188"><span class="s36">Figure 3.5 Shifts in

every given price, the quantity demanded is higher, so that the

<p>Table 3.4 Price and Demand Shifts: A Car Example</p>
<p>Now, imagine that the economy slows down so that many people lose
their jobs or work fewer hours, reducing their incomes. In this
case, the decrease in income would lead to a lower quantity of cars
demanded at every given price, and the original demand curve D<span
class="s60">0</span> would shift left to D<span
class="s60">2</span>. The shift from D<span class="s60">0</span> to
D<span class="s60">2</span> represents such a decrease in demand: At
any given price level, the quantity demanded is now lower. In this
example, a price of $20,000 means 18 million cars sold along the
original demand curve, but only 14.4 million sold after demand fell.</p>
<p>When a demand curve shifts, it does not mean that the quantity
demanded by every individual buyer changes by the same amount. In
this example, not everyone would have higher or lower income and not
everyone would buy or not buy an additional car. Instead, a shift in
a demand curve captures a pattern for the market as a whole.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark190">In the previous section, we argued that
higher income causes greater demand at every price. This is true for
most goods and services. For some—luxury cars, vacations in Europe,
and fine jewelry—the effect of a rise in income can be especially
pronounced. A product whose demand rises when income rises, and vice
versa, is called a</span> <strong>normal good</strong>. A few exceptions to this
pattern do exist. As incomes rise, many people will buy fewer
generic brand groceries and more name brand groceries. They are less
likely to buy used cars and more likely to buy new cars. They will
be less likely to rent an apartment and more likely to own a home. A
product whose demand falls when income rises, and vice versa, is
called an <strong>inferior good</strong>. In other words, when income increases,
the demand curve shifts to the left.<span id="bookmark191">‌</span></p>
<p>Other Factors That Shift Demand Curves</p>
<p>Income is not the only factor that causes a shift in demand. Other
factors that change demand include tastes and preferences, the
composition or size of the population, the prices of related goods,
and even expectations. A change in any one of the underlying factors
that determine what quantity people are willing to buy at a given
price will cause a shift in demand. Graphically, the new demand
curve lies either to the right (an increase) or to the left (a
decrease) of the original demand curve. Let’s look at these factors.</p>
<p>Changing Tastes or Preferences</p>
<p>From 1980 to 2014, the per-person consumption of chicken by
Americans rose from 48 pounds per year to 85 pounds per year, and
consumption of beef fell from 77 pounds per year to 54 pounds per
year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).
Changes like these are largely due to movements in taste, which
change the quantity of a good demanded at every price: that is, they
shift the demand curve for that good, rightward for chicken and
leftward for beef.</p>
<p>Changes in the Composition of the Population</p>
<p><span id="bookmark192">The proportion of elderly citizens in the
United States population is rising. It rose from 9.8% in 1970 to
12.6% in 2000, and will be a projected (by the U.S. Census Bureau)
20% of the population by 2030. A society with relatively more
children, like the United States in the 1960s, will have greater
demand for goods and services like tricycles and day care
facilities. A society with relatively more elderly persons, as the
United States is projected to have by 2030, has a higher demand for
nursing homes and hearing aids. Similarly, changes in the size of
the population can affect the demand for housing and many other
goods. Each of these changes in demand will be shown as a shift in
the demand curve.</span></p>
<p>Changes in the prices of related goods such as substitutes or
complements also can affect the demand for a product. A</p>
<p><span id="bookmark193">substitute</span> <span class="p">is a good
or service that we can use in place of another good or service. As
electronic books, like this one, become more available, you would
expect to see a decrease in demand for traditional printed books. A
lower price for a substitute decreases demand for the other product.
For example, in recent years as the price of tablet computers has
fallen, the quantity demanded has increased (because of the law of
demand). Since people are purchasing tablets, there has been a
decrease in demand for laptops, which we can show graphically as a
leftward shift in the demand curve for laptops. A higher price for a
substitute good has the reverse effect.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark194">Other goods are</span> <strong>complements</strong> for
each other, meaning we often use the goods together, because
consumption of one good tends to enhance consumption of the other.
Examples include breakfast cereal and milk; notebooks and pens or
pencils, golf balls and golf clubs; gasoline and sport utility
vehicles; and the five-way combination of bacon, lettuce, tomato,
mayonnaise, and bread. If the price of golf clubs rises, since the
quantity demanded of golf clubs falls (because of the law of
demand), demand for a complement good like golf balls decreases,
too. Similarly, a higher price for skis would shift the demand curve
for a complement good like ski resort trips to the left, while a
lower price for a complement has the reverse effect.</p>
<p>Changes in Expectations about Future Prices or Other Factors that
Affect Demand</p>

<p><span id="bookmark196">Figure 3.6 Demand Curve</span> <span
class="s37">We can use the demand curve to identify how much
consumers would buy at any given price.</span></p>
<p>Step 2. Suppose income increases. As a result of the change, are
consumers going to buy more or less pizza? The answer is more. Draw
a dotted horizontal line from the chosen price, through the original
quantity demanded, to the new point with the new Q<span
class="s63">1</span>. Draw a dotted vertical line down to the
horizontal axis and label the new Q<span
class="s63">1</span><a href="#bookmark197" class="s84">.</a>
<a href="#bookmark197" class="s43">Figure 3.7</a><span class="s36">
</span>provides an example.</p>
<p>Shift in Demand</p>
<p>A shift in demand means that at any price (and at every price), the
quantity demanded will be different than it was before. Following is
an example of a shift in demand due to an income increase.</p>
<p>Step 1. Draw the graph of a demand curve for a normal good like
pizza. Pick a price (like P<span class="s63">0</span>). Identify the
corresponding Q<span
class="s63">0</span><a href="#bookmark196" class="s84">. See an example in</a>
<a href="#bookmark196" class="s43">Figure</a> <span
class="s36">3.6</span>.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark195">While it is clear that the price of a good
affects the quantity demanded, it is also true that expectations
about the future price (or expectations about tastes and
preferences, income, and so on) can affect demand. For example, if
people hear that a hurricane is coming, they may rush to the store
to buy flashlight batteries and bottled water. If people learn that
the price of a good like coffee is likely to rise in the future,
they may head for the store to stock up on coffee now. We show these
changes in demand as shifts in the curve. Therefore, a</span>
<strong>shift in demand</strong> happens when a change in some economic factor
(other than price) causes a different quantity to be demanded at
every price. The following Work It Out feature shows how this
happens.</p>

Demand</span><span id="bookmark198">‌</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark199" class="a">Figure 3.9</a> <span

direction of the arrows indicates whether the demand curve shifts
represent an increase in demand or a decrease in demand. Notice that
a change in the price of the good or service itself is not listed
among the factors that can shift a demand curve. A change in the
price of a good or service causes a movement along a specific demand
curve, and it typically leads to some change in the quantity
demanded, but it does not shift the demand curve.</span></p>

D<span class="s63">1</span>. (b) The same factors, if their
direction is reversed, can cause a decrease in demand from D<span
class="s63">0</span> to D<span class="s63">1</span>.</p>
<p>When a demand curve shifts, it will then intersect with a given
supply curve at a different equilibrium price and quantity. We are,
however, getting ahead of our story. Before discussing how changes
in demand can affect equilibrium price and quantity, we first need
to discuss shifts in supply curves.</p>
<p>How Production Costs Affect Supply</p>
<p><span id="bookmark200">A supply curve shows how quantity supplied
will change as the price rises and falls, assuming</span> <em>ceteris
paribus</em> so that no other economically relevant factors are
changing. If other factors relevant to supply do change, then the
entire supply curve will shift. Just as we described a shift in
demand as a change in the quantity demanded at every price, a
<strong>shift in supply</strong> means a change in the quantity supplied at every
price.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark201">In thinking about the factors that affect
supply, remember what motivates firms: profits, which are the
difference between revenues and costs. A firm produces goods and
services using combinations of labor, materials, and machinery, or
what we call</span> <strong>inputs</strong> or <strong>factors of production</strong>. If a
firm faces lower costs of production, while the prices for the good
or service the firm produces remain unchanged, a firm’s profits go
up. When a firm’s profits increase, it is more motivated to produce
output, since the more it produces the more profit it will earn.
When costs of production fall, a firm will tend to supply a larger
quantity at any given price for its output. We can show this by the
supply curve shifting to the right.</p>
<p>Take, for example, a messenger company that delivers packages around
a city. The company may find that buying gasoline is one of its main
costs. If the price of gasoline falls, then the company will find it
can deliver messages more cheaply than before. Since lower costs
correspond to higher profits, the messenger company may now supply
more of its services at any given price. For example, given the
lower gasoline prices, the company can now serve a greater area, and
increase its supply.</p>
<p>Conversely, if a firm faces higher costs of production, then it will
earn lower profits at any given selling price for its products. As a
result, a higher cost of production typically causes a firm to
supply a smaller quantity at any given price. In this case, the
supply curve shifts to the left.</p>
<p>Consider the supply for cars, shown by curve S<span
class="s60">0</span> <a href="#bookmark202" class="s34">in</a>
<a href="#bookmark202" class="a">Figure</a> <span
class="s54">3.10</span>. Point J indicates that if the price is
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(20,000, the quantity supplied will be 18 million cars. If the price
rises to \)</span>22,000 per car, <em>ceteris paribus,</em> the quantity supplied
will rise to 20 million cars, as point K on the S<span
class="s60">0</span>
<a href="#bookmark203" class="s34">curve shows. We can show the same information in table form, as in</a>

<p><span id="bookmark202"><span class="s36">Figure 3.10 Shifts in

every given price, the quantity supplied is lower, so that the

<p>Table 3.5 Price and Shifts in Supply: A Car Example</p>
<p>Now, imagine that the price of steel, an important ingredient in
manufacturing cars, rises, so that producing a car has become more
expensive. At any given price for selling cars, car manufacturers
will react by supplying a lower quantity. We can show this
graphically as a leftward shift of supply, from S<span
class="s60">0</span> to S<span class="s60">1</span>, which indicates
that at any given price, the quantity supplied decreases. In this
example, at a price of $20,000, the quantity supplied decreases from
18 million on the original supply curve (S<span
class="s60">0</span>) to 16.5 million on the supply curve S<span
class="s60">1</span>, which is labeled as point L.</p>
<p>Conversely, if the price of steel decreases, producing a car becomes
less expensive. At any given price for selling cars, car
manufacturers can now expect to earn higher profits, so they will
supply a higher quantity. The shift of supply to the right, from
S<span class="s60">0</span> to S<span class="s60">2</span>, means
that at all prices, the quantity supplied has increased. In this
example, at a price of $20,000, the quantity supplied increases from
18 million on the original supply curve (S<span
class="s60">0</span>) to 19.8 million on the supply curve S<span
class="s60">2</span>, which is labeled M.</p>
<p>Other Factors That Affect Supply</p>
<p>In the example above, we saw that changes in the prices of inputs in
the production process will affect the cost of production and thus
the supply. Several other things affect the cost of production, too,
such as changes in weather or other natural conditions, new
technologies for production, and some government policies.</p>
<p>Changes in weather and climate will affect the cost of production
for many agricultural products. For example, in</p>
<p>2014 the Manchurian Plain in Northeastern China, which produces most
of the country’s wheat, corn, and soybeans, experienced its most
severe drought in 50 years. A drought decreases the supply of
agricultural products, which means that at any given price, a lower
quantity will be supplied. Conversely, especially good weather would
shift the supply curve to the right.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark204">When a firm discovers a new technology that
allows the firm to produce at a lower cost, the supply curve will
shift to the right, as well. For instance, in the 1960s a major
scientific effort nicknamed the Green Revolution focused on breeding
improved seeds for basic crops like wheat and rice. By the early
1990s, more than two-thirds of the wheat and rice in low-income
countries around the world used these Green Revolution seeds—and the
harvest was twice as high per acre. A technological improvement that
reduces costs of production will shift supply to the right, so that
a greater quantity will be produced at any given price.</span></p>
<p>Government policies can affect the cost of production and the supply
curve through taxes, regulations, and subsidies. For example, the
U.S. government imposes a tax on alcoholic beverages that collects
about $8 billion per year from producers. Businesses treat taxes as
costs. Higher costs decrease supply for the reasons we discussed
above. Other examples of policy that can affect cost are the wide
array of government regulations that require firms to spend money to
provide a cleaner environment or a safer workplace. Complying with
regulations increases costs.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_073.png" width="624" height="541" alt="image" />
<p>A government subsidy, on the other hand, is the opposite of a tax. A
subsidy occurs when the government pays a firm directly or reduces
the firm’s taxes if the firm carries out certain actions. From the
firm’s perspective, taxes or regulations are an additional cost of
production that shifts supply to the left, leading the firm to
produce a lower quantity at every given price. Government subsidies
reduce the cost of production and increase supply at every given
price, shifting supply to the right. The following Work It Out
feature shows how this shift happens.</p>
<p>Shift in Supply</p>
<p>We know that a supply curve shows the minimum price a firm will
accept to produce a given quantity of output. What happens to the
supply curve when the cost of production goes up? Following is an
example of a shift in supply due to a production cost increase.</p>
<p>Step 1. Draw a graph of a supply curve for pizza. Pick a quantity
(like Q<span class="s63">0</span>). If you draw a vertical line up
from Q<span class="s63">0</span>
<a href="#bookmark205" class="s84">to the supply curve, you will see the price the firm chooses.</a>
<a href="#bookmark205" class="s43">Figure 3.11</a><span class="s36">
</span>provides an example.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark205">Figure 3.11 Supply Curve</span> <span
class="s37">You can use a supply curve to show the minimum price a
firm will accept to produce a given quantity of output.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark206" class="s84">Step 2. Why did the firm choose that price and not some other? One way to think about this is that the price is composed of two parts. The first part is the cost of producing pizzas at the margin; in this case, the cost of producing the pizza, including cost of ingredients (e.g., dough, sauce, cheese, and pepperoni), the cost of the pizza oven, the shop rent, and the workers’ wages. The second part is the firm’s desired profit, which is determined, among other factors, by the profit margins in that particular business. If you add these two parts together, you get the price the firm wishes to charge. The quantity Q0 and associated price P0 give you one point on the firm’s supply curve, as</a>
<a href="#bookmark206" class="s43">Figure 3.12</a> <span
class="s37">illustrates.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark206">Figure 3.12 Setting Prices</span> <span
class="s37">The cost of production and the desired profit equal the
price a firm will set for a product.</span></p>
<p>Step 3. Now, suppose that the cost of production increases. Perhaps
cheese has become more expensive by</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark207" class="s84"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0.75 per pizza. If that is true, the firm will want to raise its price by the amount of the increase in cost (\)</span>0.75). Draw this point on the supply curve directly above the initial point on the curve, but $0.75 higher, as</a>
<a href="#bookmark207" class="s43">Figure</a></p>
<p>3.13 <span class="s37">shows.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark207">Figure 3.13 Increasing Costs Leads to
Increasing Price</span> <span class="s37">Because the cost of
production and the desired profit equal the price a firm will set
for a product, if the cost of production increases, the price for
the product will also need to increase.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark208" class="s84">Step 4. Shift the supply curve through this point. You will see that an increase in cost causes an upward (or a leftward) shift of the supply curve so that at any price, the quantities supplied will be smaller, as</a>
<a href="#bookmark208" class="s43">Figure</a> 3.14 <span
class="s37">illustrates.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark208">Figure 3.14 Supply Curve Shifts</span> <span
class="s37">When the cost of production increases, the supply curve
shifts upwardly to a new price level.</span></p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_074.png" width="624" height="887" alt="image" />
<p>Summing Up Factors That Change Supply</p>
<p>Changes in the cost of inputs, natural disasters, new technologies,
and the impact of government decisions all affect the cost of
production. In turn, these factors affect how much firms are willing
to supply at any given price.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark209" class="a">Figure 3.15</a> <span
class="p">summarizes factors that change the supply of goods and
services. Notice that a change in the price of the product itself is
not among the factors that shift the supply curve. Although a change
in price of a good or service typically causes a change in quantity
supplied or a movement along the supply curve for that specific good
or service, it does not cause the supply curve itself to
shift.</span></p>

<p>Because demand and supply curves appear on a two-dimensional diagram
with only price and quantity on the axes, an unwary visitor to the
land of economics might be fooled into believing that economics is
about only four topics: demand, supply, price, and quantity.
However, demand and supply are really “umbrella” concepts: demand
covers all the factors that affect demand, and supply covers all the
factors that affect supply. We include factors other than price that
affect demand and supply are included by using shifts in the demand
or the supply curve. In this way, the two-dimensional demand and
supply model becomes a powerful tool for analyzing a wide range of
economic circumstances.</p>

<h2>Introduction to Labor and Financial Markets<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-to-labor-and-financial-markets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In this chapter, you will learn about:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Demand and Supply at Work in Labor Markets</p></li>
<li><p>Demand and Supply in Financial Markets</p></li>
<li><p>The Market System as an Efficient Mechanism for Information</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The theories of supply and demand do not apply just to markets for
goods. They apply to any market, even markets for things we may not
think of as goods and services like labor and financial services. Labor
markets are markets for employees or jobs. Financial services markets
are markets for saving or borrowing.</p>
<p>When we think about demand and supply curves in goods and services
markets, it is easy to picture the demanders and suppliers: businesses
produce the products and households buy them. Who are the demanders and
suppliers in labor and financial service markets? In labor markets job
seekers (individuals) are the suppliers of labor, while firms and other
employers who hire labor are the demanders for labor. In financial
markets, any individual or firm who saves contributes to the supply of
money, and any who borrows (person, firm, or government) contributes to
the demand for money.</p>
<p>As a college student, you most likely participate in both labor and
financial markets. Employment is a fact of life for most college
students: According to the National Center for Educational Statistics,
in 2013 40% of full-time college students and 76% of part-time college
students were employed. Most college students are also heavily involved
in financial markets, primarily as borrowers. Among full-time students,
about half take out a loan to help finance their education each year,
and those loans average about $6,000 per year. Many students also borrow
for other expenses, like purchasing a car. As this chapter will
illustrate, we can analyze labor markets and financial markets with the
same tools we use to analyze demand and supply in the goods markets.</p>

<p><span id="bookmark299">Markets for labor have demand and supply
curves, just like markets for goods. The law of demand applies
in labor markets this way: A higher</span> <strong>salary</strong> or
<strong>wage</strong>—that is, a higher price in the labor market—leads to a
decrease in the quantity of labor demanded by employers, while a
lower salary or wage leads to an increase in the quantity of
labor demanded. The law of supply functions in labor markets,
too: A higher price for labor leads to a higher quantity of
labor supplied; a lower price leads to a lower quantity
supplied.</p>

<p>Table 4.1 Demand and Supply of Nurses in Minneapolis-St.
Paul-Bloomington</p>
<p>The horizontal axis shows the quantity of nurses hired. In this
example we measure labor by number of workers, but another
common way to measure the quantity of labor is by the number of
hours worked. The vertical axis shows the price for nurses’
labor—that is, how much they are paid. In the real world, this
“price” would be total labor compensation: salary plus benefits.
It is not obvious, but benefits are a significant part (as high
as 30 percent) of labor compensation. In this example we measure
the price of labor by salary on an annual basis, although in
other cases we could measure the price of labor by monthly or
weekly pay, or even the wage paid per hour. As the salary for
nurses rises, the quantity demanded will fall. Some hospitals
and nursing homes may reduce the number of nurses they hire, or
they may lay off some of their existing nurses, rather than pay
them higher salaries. Employers who face higher nurses’ salaries
may also try to replace some nursing functions by investing in
physical equipment, like computer monitoring and diagnostic
systems to monitor patients, or by using lower-paid health care
aides to reduce the number of nurses they need.</p>
<p>As the salary for nurses rises, the quantity supplied will rise.
If nurses’ salaries in Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington are
higher than in other cities, more nurses will move to
Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington to find jobs, more people will
be willing to train as nurses, and those currently trained as
nurses will be more likely to pursue nursing as a full- time
job. In other words, there will be more nurses looking for jobs
in the area.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark302">At</span>
<strong>equilibrium</strong><a href="#bookmark300" class="s34">, the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded are equal. Thus, every employer who wants to hire a nurse at this equilibrium wage can find a willing worker, and every nurse who wants to work at this equilibrium salary can find a job. In</a>
<a href="#bookmark300" class="a">Figure</a> <span
class="s54">4.2</span>, the supply curve (S) and demand
curve (D) intersect at the equilibrium point (E). The
equilibrium quantity of nurses in the Minneapolis-St.
Paul-Bloomington area is 34,000, and the equilibrium salary is
$70,000 per year. This example simplifies the nursing market by
focusing on the “average” nurse. In reality, of course, the
market for nurses actually comprises many smaller markets, like
markets for nurses with varying degrees of experience and
credentials. Many markets contain closely related products that
differ in quality. For instance, even a simple product like
gasoline comes in regular, premium, and super-premium, each with
a different price. Even in such cases, discussing the average
price of gasoline, like the average salary for nurses, can still
be useful because it reflects what is happening in most of the
submarkets.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark303">When the price of labor is not at the
equilibrium, economic incentives tend to move salaries toward
the equilibrium. For example, if salaries for nurses in
Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington were above the equilibrium at
$75,000 per year, then 38,000 people want to work as nurses, but
employers want to hire only 33,000 nurses. At that above-
equilibrium salary, excess supply or a surplus results. In a
situation of excess supply in the</span> <strong>labor market</strong>, with
many applicants for every job opening, employers will have an
incentive to offer lower wages than they otherwise would have.
Nurses’ salary will move down toward equilibrium.</p>
<p>In contrast, if the salary is below the equilibrium at, say,
$60,000 per year, then a situation of excess demand or a
shortage arises. In this case, employers encouraged by the
relatively lower wage want to hire 40,000 nurses, but only
27,000 individuals want to work as nurses at that salary in
Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington. In response to the shortage,
some employers will offer higher pay to attract the nurses.
Other employers will have to match the higher pay to keep their
own employees. The higher salaries will encourage more nurses to
train or work in Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington. Again, price
and quantity in the labor market will move toward equilibrium.</p>
<p>Shifts in Labor Demand</p>
<p><span id="bookmark304">The demand curve for labor shows the
quantity of labor employers wish to hire at any given salary or
wage rate, under the</span> <em>ceteris paribus</em> assumption. A
change in the wage or salary will result in a change in the
quantity demanded of labor. If the wage rate increases,
employers will want to hire fewer employees. The quantity of
labor demanded will decrease, and there will be a movement
upward along the demand curve. If the wages and salaries
decrease, employers are more likely to hire a greater number of
workers. The quantity of labor demanded will increase, resulting
in a downward movement along the demand curve.</p>
<p>Shifts in the demand curve for labor occur for many reasons. One
key reason is that the demand for labor is based on the demand
for the good or service that is produced. For example, the more
new automobiles consumers demand, the greater the number of
workers automakers will need to hire. Therefore the demand for
labor is called a “derived demand.” Here are some examples of
derived demand for labor:</p>
</li>
<li><p>The demand for chefs is dependent on the demand for restaurant
meals.</p></li>
<li><p>The demand for pharmacists is dependent on the demand for
prescription drugs.</p></li>
<li><p>The demand for attorneys is dependent on the demand for legal
services.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#bookmark305" class="s34">As the demand for the goods and services increases, the demand for labor will increase, or shift to the right, to meet employers’ production requirements. As the demand for the goods and services decreases, the demand for labor will decrease, or shift to the left.</a>
<a href="#bookmark305" class="a">Table 4.2</a> <span class="p">shows
that in addition to the derived demand for labor, demand can also
increase or decrease (shift) in response to several factors.</span></p>

When these qualifications are made tougher, the number of qualified workers will decrease at any given wage. On the other hand, the government may also subsidize training or even reduce the required level of qualifications. For example, government might offer subsidies for nursing schools or nursing students. Such provisions would shift the supply curve of nurses to the right. In addition, government policies that change the relative desirability of working versus not working also affect the labor supply. These include unemployment benefits, maternity leave, child care benefits, and welfare policy. For example, child care benefits may increase the labor supply of working mothers. Long term unemployment benefits may discourage job searching for unemployed workers. All these policies must therefore be carefully designed to minimize any negative labor supply effects.</p></td>

<p>Table 4.3 Factors that Can Shift Supply</p>
<p>A change in salary will lead to a movement along labor demand or
labor supply curves, but it will not shift those curves. However,
other events like those we have outlined here will cause either the
demand or the supply of labor to shift, and thus will move the labor
market to a new equilibrium salary and quantity.</p>
<p>Technology and Wage Inequality: The Four-Step Process</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark159" class="s34">Economic events can change the equilibrium salary (or wage) and quantity of labor. Consider how the wave of new information technologies, like computer and telecommunications networks, has affected low-skill and high-skill workers in the U.S. economy. From the perspective of employers who demand labor, these new technologies are often a substitute for low-skill laborers like file clerks who used to keep file cabinets full of paper records of transactions. However, the same new technologies are a complement to high-skill workers like managers, who benefit from the technological advances by having the ability to monitor more information, communicate more easily, and juggle a wider array of responsibilities. How will the new technologies affect the wages of high-skill and low-skill workers? For this question, the four-step process of analyzing how shifts in supply or demand affect a market (introduced in</a>
<a href="#bookmark159" class="a">Demand and</a> Supply<span
class="p">) works in this way:</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark307" class="s34">Step 1. What did the markets for low-skill labor and high-skill labor look like before the arrival of the new technologies? In</a>

<p>Step 2. Does the new technology affect the supply of labor from
households or the demand for labor from firms? The technology change
described here affects demand for labor by firms that hire workers.</p>
<p>Step 3. Will the new technology increase or decrease demand? Based
on the description earlier, as the substitute for low-skill labor
becomes available, demand for low-skill labor will shift to the
left, from D<span class="s60">0</span> to D<span
class="s60">1</span>. As the technology complement for high-skill
labor becomes cheaper, demand for high-skill labor will shift to the
right, from D<span class="s60">0</span> to D<span
class="s60">1</span>.</p>
<p>Step 4. The new equilibrium for low-skill labor, shown as point
E<span class="s60">1</span> with price W<span class="s60">1</span>

higher wage and quantity hired than the original equilibrium (E<span

<p>Thus, the demand and supply model predicts that the new computer and
communications technologies will raise the pay of high-skill workers
but reduce the pay of low-skill workers. From the 1970s to the
mid-2000s, the wage gap widened between high-skill and low-skill
labor. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, in
1980, for example, a college graduate earned about 30% more than a
high school graduate with comparable job experience, but by 2014, a
college graduate earned about 66% more than an otherwise comparable
high school graduate. Many economists believe that the trend toward
greater wage inequality across the U.S. economy is due to

<p>Price Floors in the Labor Market: Living Wages and Minimum Wages</p>
<p>In contrast to goods and services markets, price ceilings are rare
in labor markets, because rules that prevent people from earning
income are not politically popular. There is one exception: boards
of trustees or stockholders, as an example, propose limits on the
high incomes of top business executives.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark308">The labor market, however, presents some
prominent examples of price floors, which are an attempt to increase
the wages of low-paid workers. The U.S. government sets a</span>
<strong>minimum wage</strong>, a price floor that makes it illegal for an
employer to pay employees less than a certain hourly rate. In
mid-2009, the U.S. minimum wage was raised to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(7.25 per hour. Local
political movements in a number of U.S. cities have pushed for a
higher minimum wage, which they call a **living wage**. Promoters of
living wage laws maintain that the minimum wage is too low to ensure
a reasonable standard of living. They base this conclusion on the
calculation that, if you work 40 hours a week at a minimum wage of
\)</span>7.25 per hour for 50 weeks a year, your annual income is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(14,500,
which is less than the official U.S. government definition of what
it means for a family to be in poverty. (A family with two adults
earning minimum wage and two young children will find it more cost
efficient for one parent to provide childcare while the other works
for income. Thus the family income would be \)</span>14,500, which is
significantly lower than the federal poverty line for a family of
four, which was $24,250 in 2015.)<span id="bookmark309">‌</span></p>
<p>Supporters of the living wage argue that full-time workers should be
assured a high enough wage so that they can afford the essentials of
life: food, clothing, shelter, and healthcare. Since Baltimore
passed the first living wage law in 1994, several dozen cities
enacted similar laws in the late 1990s and the 2000s. The living
wage ordinances do not apply to all employers, but they have
specified that all employees of the city or employees of firms that
the city hires be paid at least a certain wage that is usually a few
dollars per hour above the U.S. minimum wage.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark310" class="a">Figure 4.4</a>
<a href="#bookmark311" class="s34">illustrates the situation of a city considering a living wage law. For simplicity, we assume that there is no federal minimum wage. The wage appears on the vertical axis, because the wage is the price in the labor market. Before the passage of the living wage law, the equilibrium wage is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10 per hour and the city hires 1,200 workers at this wage. However, a group of concerned citizens persuades the city council to enact a living wage law requiring employers to pay no less than \)</span>12 per hour. In response to the higher wage, 1,600 workers look for jobs with the city. At this higher wage, the city, as an employer, is willing to hire only 700 workers. At the price floor, the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded, and a surplus of labor exists in this market. For workers who continue to have a job at a higher salary, life has improved. For those who were willing to work at the old wage rate but lost their jobs with the wage increase, life has not improved.</a>

<p>Table 4.4 Living Wage: Example of a Price Floor</p>
<p>The Minimum Wage as an Example of a Price Floor</p>
<p>The U.S. minimum wage is a price floor that is set either very close
to the equilibrium wage or even slightly below it. About 1% of
American workers are actually paid the minimum wage. In other words,
the vast majority of the U.S. labor force has its wages determined
in the labor market, not as a result of the government price floor.
However, for workers with low skills and little experience, like
those without a high school diploma or teenagers, the minimum wage
is quite important. In many cities, the federal minimum wage is
apparently below the market price for unskilled labor, because
employers offer more than the minimum wage to checkout clerks and
other low-skill workers without any government prodding.</p>
<p>Economists have attempted to estimate how much the minimum wage
reduces the quantity demanded of low-skill labor. A typical result
of such studies is that a 10% increase in the minimum wage would
decrease the hiring of unskilled workers by 1 to 2%, which seems a
relatively small reduction. In fact, some studies have even found no
effect of a higher minimum wage on employment at certain times and
places—although these studies are controversial.</p>
<p>Let’s suppose that the minimum wage lies just slightly <em>below</em> the
equilibrium wage level. Wages could fluctuate according to market
forces above this price floor, but they would not be allowed to move
beneath the floor. In this situation, the price floor minimum wage
is <em>nonbinding</em> —that is, the price floor is not determining the
market outcome. Even if the minimum wage moves just a little higher,
it will still have no effect on the quantity of</p>
<p>employment in the economy, as long as it remains below the
equilibrium wage. Even if the government increases minimum wage by
enough so that it rises slightly above the equilibrium wage and
becomes binding, there will be only a small excess supply gap
between the quantity demanded and quantity supplied.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_095.png" width="624" height="471" alt="image" />
<p>These insights help to explain why U.S. minimum wage laws have
historically had only a small impact on employment. Since the
minimum wage has typically been set close to the equilibrium wage
for low-skill labor and sometimes even below it, it has not had a
large effect in creating an excess supply of labor. However, if the
minimum wage increased dramatically—say, if it doubled to match the
living wages that some U.S. cities have considered—then its impact
on reducing the quantity demanded of employment would be far
greater. As of 2017, many U.S. states are set to increase their
minimum wage to $15 per hour. We will see what happens. The
following Clear It Up feature describes in greater detail some of
the arguments for and against changes to minimum wage.</p>
<p>What’s the harm in raising the minimum wage?</p>
<p>Because of the law of demand, a higher required wage will reduce the
amount of low-skill employment either in terms of employees or in
terms of work hours. Although there is controversy over the numbers,
let’s say for the sake of the argument that a 10% rise in the
minimum wage will reduce the employment of low-skill workers by 2%.
Does this outcome mean that raising the minimum wage by 10% is bad
public policy? Not necessarily.</p>
<p>If 98% of those receiving the minimum wage have a pay increase of
10%, but 2% of those receiving the minimum wage lose their jobs, are
the gains for society as a whole greater than the losses? The answer
is not clear, because job losses, even for a small group, may cause
more pain than modest income gains for others. For one thing, we
need to consider which minimum wage workers are losing their jobs.
If the 2% of minimum wage workers who lose their jobs are struggling
to support families, that is one thing. If those who lose their job
are high school students picking up spending money over summer
vacation, that is something else.</p>
<p>Another complexity is that many minimum wage workers do not work
full-time for an entire year. Imagine a minimum wage worker who
holds different part-time jobs for a few months at a time, with
bouts of unemployment in between. The worker in this situation
receives the 10% raise in the minimum wage when working, but also
ends up working 2% fewer hours during the year because the higher
minimum wage reduces how much employers want people to work.
Overall, this worker’s income would rise because the 10% pay raise
would more than offset the 2% fewer hours worked.</p>
<p><a href="http://cnx.org/content/m63897/latest/" class="s84">Of course, these arguments do not prove that raising the minimum wage is necessarily a good idea either. There may well be other, better public policy options for helping low-wage workers. (The</a>

discusses some possibilities.) The lesson from this maze of minimum
wage arguments is that complex social problems rarely have simple
answers. Even those who agree on how a proposed economic policy
affects quantity demanded and quantity supplied may still disagree
on whether the policy is a good idea.</span></p>

<p>United States’ households, institutions, and domestic businesses
saved almost $1.3 trillion in 2015. Where did that savings go and
how was it used? Some of the savings ended up in banks, which in
turn loaned the money to individuals or businesses that wanted to
borrow money. Some was invested in private companies or loaned to</p>
<p>government agencies that wanted to borrow money to raise funds for
purposes like building roads or mass transit. Some firms reinvested
their savings in their own businesses.</p>

<a href="http://cnx.org/content/m63860/latest/" class="s34">(i.e., savings) with those who demand financial capital (i.e., borrowing).

</span>chapter.</p>
<p>Who Demands and Who Supplies in Financial Markets?</p>
<p>In any market, the price is what suppliers receive and what
demanders pay. In financial markets, those who supply financial
capital through saving expect to receive a rate of return, while
those who demand financial capital by receiving funds expect to pay
a rate of return. This rate of return can come in a variety of
forms, depending on the type of investment.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark314">The simplest example of a rate of return is
the</span> <strong>interest rate</strong>. For example, when you supply money
into a savings account at a bank, you receive interest on your
deposit. The interest the bank pays you as a percent of your
deposits is the interest rate. Similarly, if you demand a loan to
buy a car or a computer, you will need to pay interest on the money
you borrow.</p>
<p>Let’s consider the market for borrowing money with credit cards. In
2015, almost 200 million Americans were cardholders. Credit cards
allow you to borrow money from the card’s issuer, and pay back the
borrowed amount plus interest, although most allow you a period of
time in which you can repay the loan without paying interest. A
typical credit card interest rate ranges from 12% to 18% per year.
In May 2016, Americans had about $943 billion outstanding in credit
card debts. About half of U.S. families with credit cards report
that they almost always pay the full balance on time, but
one-quarter of U.S. families with credit cards say that they “hardly
ever” pay off the card in full. In fact, in 2014, 56% of consumers
carried an unpaid balance in the last 12 months. Let’s say that, on
average, the annual interest rate for credit card borrowing is 15%
per year. Thus, Americans pay tens of billions of dollars every year
in interest on their credit cards—plus basic fees for the credit
card or fees for late payments.</p>

<p>Table 4.5 Demand and Supply for Borrowing Money with Credit Cards</p>
<p><span id="bookmark317">The laws of demand and supply continue to
apply in the financial markets. According to the</span> <strong>law of
demand</strong>, a higher rate of return (that is, a higher price) will
decrease the quantity demanded. As the interest rate rises,
consumers will reduce the quantity that they borrow. According to
the law of supply, a higher price increases the quantity supplied.
Consequently, as the interest rate paid on credit card borrowing
rises, more firms will be eager to issue credit cards and to
encourage customers to use them. Conversely, if the interest rate on
credit cards falls, the quantity of financial capital supplied in
the credit card market will decrease and the quantity demanded will
fall.</p>
<p>Equilibrium in Financial Markets</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark315" class="s34">In the financial market for credit cards in</a>
<a href="#bookmark315" class="a">Figure</a> 4.5<span class="p">, the
supply curve (S) and the demand curve (D) cross at the equilibrium
point (E). The equilibrium occurs at an interest rate of 15%, where
the quantity of funds demanded and the quantity supplied are equal
at an equilibrium quantity of $600 billion.</span></p>
<p>If the interest rate (remember, this measures the “price” in the
financial market) is above the equilibrium level, then an excess
supply, or a surplus, of financial capital will arise in this
market. For example, at an interest rate of 21%, the quantity of
funds supplied increases to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(750 billion, while the quantity
demanded decreases to \)</span>480 billion. At this</p>
<p>above-equilibrium interest rate, firms are eager to supply loans to
credit card borrowers, but relatively few people or businesses wish
to borrow. As a result, some credit card firms will lower the
interest rates (or other fees) they charge to attract more business.
This strategy will push the interest rate down toward the
equilibrium level.</p>
<p>If the interest rate is below the equilibrium, then excess demand or
a shortage of funds occurs in this market. At an interest rate of
13%, the quantity of funds credit card borrowers demand increases to
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(700 billion, but the quantity credit card firms are willing to
supply is only \)</span>510 billion. In this situation, credit card firms
will perceive that they are overloaded with eager borrowers and
conclude that they have an opportunity to raise interest rates or
fees. The interest rate will face economic pressures to creep up
toward the equilibrium level.</p>
<p><a href="https://openstax.org/l/FRED_stlouis" class="s34">The FRED database publishes some two dozen measures of interest rates, including interest rates on credit cards, automobile loans, personal loans, mortgage loans, and more. You can find these at the FRED</a>

<p>Shifts in Demand and Supply in Financial Markets</p>
<p>Those who supply financial capital face two broad decisions: how
much to save, and how to divide up their savings among different
forms of financial investments. We will discuss each of these in
turn.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark318">Participants in financial markets must decide
when they prefer to consume goods: now or in the future. Economists
call this</span> <strong>intertemporal decision making</strong> because it
involves decisions across time. Unlike a decision about what to buy
from the grocery store, people make investment or savings decisions
across a period of time, sometimes a long period.</p>
<p>Most workers save for retirement because their income in the present
is greater than their needs, while the opposite will be true once
they retire. Thus, they save today and supply financial markets. If
their income increases, they save more. If their perceived situation
in the future changes, they change the amount of their saving. For
example, there is some evidence that Social Security, the program
that workers pay into in order to qualify for government checks
after retirement, has tended to reduce the quantity of financial
capital that workers save. If this is true, Social Security has
shifted the supply of financial capital at any interest rate to the
left.</p>
<p>By contrast, many college students need money today when their
income is low (or nonexistent) to pay their college expenses. As a
result, they borrow today and demand from financial markets. Once
they graduate and become employed, they will pay back the loans.
Individuals borrow money to purchase homes or cars. A business seeks
financial investment so that it has the funds to build a factory or
invest in a research and development project that will not pay off
for five years, ten years, or even more. Thus, when consumers and
businesses have greater confidence that they will be able to repay
in the future, the quantity demanded of financial capital at any
given interest rate will shift to the right.</p>
<p>For example, in the technology boom of the late 1990s, many
businesses became extremely confident that investments in new
technology would have a high rate of return, and their demand for
financial capital shifted to the right. Conversely, during the 2008
and 2009 Great Recession, their demand for financial capital at any
given interest rate shifted to the left.</p>
<p>To this point, we have been looking at saving in total. Now let us
consider what affects saving in different types of financial
investments. In deciding between different forms of financial
investments, suppliers of financial capital will have to consider
the rates of return and the risks involved. Rate of return is a
positive attribute of investments, but risk is a negative. If
Investment A becomes more risky, or the return diminishes, then
savers will shift their funds to Investment B—and the supply curve
of financial capital for Investment A will shift back to the left
while the supply curve of capital for Investment B shifts to the
right.</p>
<p>The United States as a Global Borrower</p>
<p>In the global economy, trillions of dollars of financial investment
cross national borders every year. In the early 2000s, financial
investors from foreign countries were investing several hundred
billion dollars per year more in the</p>
<p>U.S. economy than U.S. financial investors were investing abroad.
The following Work It Out deals with one of the macroeconomic
concerns for the U.S. economy in recent years.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_097.png" width="624" height="675" alt="image" />
<p>The Effect of Growing U.S. Debt</p>
<p>Imagine that foreign investors viewed the U.S. economy as a less
desirable place to put their money because of fears about the growth
of the U.S. public debt. Using the four-step process for analyzing
how changes in supply and demand affect equilibrium outcomes, how
would increased U.S. public debt affect the equilibrium price and
quantity for capital in U.S. financial markets?</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark319" class="s84">Step 1. Draw a diagram showing demand and supply for financial capital that represents the original scenario in which foreign investors are pouring money into the U.S. economy.</a>
<a href="#bookmark319" class="s43">Figure 4.6</a><span class="s36">
</span>shows a demand curve, D, and a supply curve, S, where the
supply of capital includes the funds arriving from foreign
investors. The original equilibrium E<span class="s63">0</span>
occurs at interest rate R<span class="s63">0</span> and quantity of
financial investment Q<span class="s63">0</span>.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark319"><span class="s46">Figure 4.6 The United
States as a Global Borrower Before U.S. Debt Uncertainty
</span></span>The graph shows the demand for financial capital from
and supply of financial capital into the U.S. financial markets by
the foreign sector before the increase in uncertainty regarding U.S.
public debt. The original equilibrium (E<span class="s63">0</span>)
occurs at an equilibrium rate of return (R<span
class="s63">0</span>) and the equilibrium quantity is at Q<span
class="s63">0</span>.</p>
<p>Step 2. Will the diminished confidence in the U.S. economy as a
place to invest affect demand or supply of financial capital? Yes,
it will affect supply. Many foreign investors look to the U.S.
financial markets to store their money in safe financial vehicles
with low risk and stable returns. Diminished confidence means U.S.
financial assets will be seen as more risky.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark320" class="s84">Step 3. Will supply increase or decrease? When the enthusiasm of foreign investors’ for investing their money in the U.S. economy diminishes, the supply of financial capital shifts to the left.</a>
<a href="#bookmark320" class="s43">Figure 4.7</a><span class="s36">
</span>shows the supply curve shift from S<span class="s63">0</span>
to S<span class="s63">1</span>.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_098.png" width="624" height="390" alt="image" />
<p><span class="s46">Figure 4.7 The United States as a Global Borrower
Before and After U.S. Debt Uncertainty </span>The graph shows the
demand for financial capital and supply of financial capital into
the U.S. financial markets by the foreign sector before and after
the increase in uncertainty regarding U.S. public debt. The original
equilibrium (E<span class="s63">0</span>) occurs at an equilibrium
rate of return (R<span class="s63">0</span>) and the equilibrium
quantity is at Q<span class="s63">0</span>.</p>
<p>Step 4. Thus, foreign investors’ diminished enthusiasm leads to a
new equilibrium, E<span class="s63">1</span>, which occurs at the
higher interest rate, R<span class="s63">1</span>, and the lower
quantity of financial investment, Q<span class="s63">1</span>. In
short, U.S. borrowers will have to pay more interest on their
borrowing.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark320">The economy has experienced an enormous
inflow of foreign capital. According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic
Analysis, by the third quarter of 2015, U.S. investors had
accumulated <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(23.3 trillion of foreign assets, but foreign investors
owned a total of \)</span>30.6 trillion of U.S. assets. If foreign investors
were to pull their money out of the U.S. economy and invest
elsewhere in the world, the result could be a significantly lower
quantity of financial investment in the United States, available
only at a higher interest rate. This reduced inflow of foreign
financial investment could impose hardship on U.S. consumers and
firms interested in borrowing.</span></p>
<p>In a modern, developed economy, financial capital often moves
invisibly through electronic transfers between one bank account and
another. Yet we can analyze these flows of funds with the same tools
of demand and supply as markets for goods or labor.</p>
<p>Price Ceilings in Financial Markets: Usury Laws</p>
<p>As we noted earlier, about 200 million Americans own credit cards,
and their interest payments and fees total tens of billions of
dollars each year. It is little wonder that political pressures
sometimes arise for setting limits on the interest rates or fees
that credit card companies charge. The firms that issue credit
cards, including banks, oil companies, phone companies, and retail
stores, respond that the higher interest rates are necessary to
cover the losses created by those who borrow on their credit cards
and who do not repay on time or at all. These companies also point
out that cardholders can avoid paying interest if they pay their
bills on time.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark321" class="s34">Consider the credit card market as</a>
<a href="#bookmark321" class="a">Figure 4.8</a><span class="s54">
</span>illustrators. In this financial market, the vertical axis
shows the interest rate (which is the price in the financial
market). Demanders in the credit card market are households and
businesses. Suppliers are the companies that issue credit cards.
This figure does not use specific numbers, which would be
hypothetical in any case, but instead focuses on the underlying
economic relationships. Imagine a law imposes a price ceiling that
holds the interest rate charged on credit cards at the rate Rc,
which lies below the interest rate R<span class="s60">0</span> that
would otherwise have prevailed in the market. The horizontal dashed
line at interest rate R<span class="s60">c</span>
<a href="#bookmark321" class="s34">in</a>
<a href="#bookmark321" class="a">Figure 4.8</a><span class="s54">
</span>shows the price ceiling. The demand and supply model predicts
that at the lower price ceiling interest rate, the quantity demanded
of credit card debt will increase from its original level of Q<span
class="s60">0</span> to Qd; however, the quantity supplied of credit
card debt will decrease from the original Q<span
class="s60">0</span> to Qs. At the price ceiling (Rc), quantity
demanded will exceed quantity supplied. Consequently, a number of
people who want to have credit cards and are willing to pay the
prevailing interest rate will find that companies are unwilling to
issue cards to them. The result will be a credit shortage.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_099.jpg" width="312" height="230" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark321"><span class="s36">Figure 4.8 Credit Card
Interest Rates: Another Price Ceiling Example </span></span>The
original intersection of demand D and supply S occurs at equilibrium
E<span class="s63">0</span>. However, a price ceiling is set at the
interest rate Rc, below the equilibrium interest rate R<span
class="s63">0</span>, and so the interest rate cannot adjust upward
to the equilibrium. At the price ceiling, the quantity demanded, Qd,
exceeds the quantity supplied, Qs. There is excess demand, also
called a shortage.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark322">Many states do have</span> <strong>usury laws</strong>,
which impose an upper limit on the interest rate that lenders can
charge. However, in many cases these upper limits are well above the
market interest rate. For example, if the interest rate is not
allowed to rise above 30% per year, it can still fluctuate below
that level according to market forces. A price ceiling that is set
at a relatively high level is nonbinding, and it will have no
practical effect unless the equilibrium price soars high enough to
exceed the price ceiling.</p>

<p>Why are demand and supply curves important?</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark96" class="s84">The demand and supply model is the second fundamental diagram for this course. (The opportunity set model that we introduced in the</a>
Choice in a World of Scarcity <span class="s37">chapter was the
first.) Just as it would be foolish to try to learn the arithmetic
of long division by memorizing every possible combination of numbers
that can be divided by each other, it would be foolish to try to
memorize every specific example of demand and supply in this
chapter, this textbook, or this course. Demand and supply is not
primarily a list of examples. It is a</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark324">Prices exist in markets for goods and
services, for labor, and for financial capital. In all of these
markets, prices serve as a remarkable social mechanism for
collecting, combining, and transmitting information that is relevant
to the market—namely, the relationship between demand and supply—and
then serving as messengers to convey that information to buyers and
sellers. In a market-oriented economy, no government agency or
guiding intelligence oversees the set of responses and
interconnections that result from a change in price. Instead, each
consumer reacts according to that person’s preferences and budget
set, and each profit-seeking producer reacts to the impact on its
expected profits. The following Clear It Up feature examines
the</span> <strong>demand and supply models</strong>.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_101.png" width="624" height="718" alt="image" />
<p>model to analyze prices and quantities. Even though demand and
supply diagrams have many labels, they are fundamentally the same in
their logic. Your goal should be to understand the underlying model
so you can use it to analyze <em>any</em> market.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark325" class="s43">Figure 4.9</a> <span
class="s37">displays a generic demand and supply curve. The
horizontal axis shows the different measures of quantity: a quantity
of a good or service, or a quantity of labor for a given job, or a
quantity of financial capital. The vertical axis shows a measure of
price: the price of a good or service, the wage in the labor market,
or the rate of return (like the interest rate) in the financial
market.</span></p>
<p>The demand and supply model can explain the existing levels of
prices, wages, and rates of return. To carry out such an analysis,
think about the quantity that will be demanded at each price and the
quantity that will be supplied at each price—that is, think about
the shape of the demand and supply curves—and how these forces will
combine to produce equilibrium.</p>
<p>We can also use demand and supply to explain how economic events
will cause changes in prices, wages, and rates of return. There are
only four possibilities: the change in any single event may cause
the demand curve to shift right or to shift left, or it may cause
the supply curve to shift right or to shift left. The key to
analyzing the effect of an economic event on equilibrium prices and
quantities is to determine which of these four possibilities
occurred. The way to do this correctly is to think back to the list
of factors that shift the demand and supply curves. Note that if
more than one variable is changing at the same time, the overall
impact will depend on the degree of the shifts. When there are
multiple variables, economists isolate each change and analyze it
independently.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark325">Figure 4.9 Demand and Supply Curves</span>
<span class="s37">The figure displays a generic demand and supply
curve. The horizontal axis shows the different measures of quantity:
a quantity of a good or service, a quantity of labor for a given
job, or a quantity of financial capital. The vertical axis shows a
measure of price: the price of a good or service, the wage in the
labor market, or the rate of return (like the interest rate) in the
financial market. We can use the demand and supply curves explain
how economic events will cause changes in prices, wages, and rates
of return.</span></p>
<p>An increase in the price of some product signals consumers that
there is a shortage; therefore, they may want to economize on buying
this product. For example, if you are thinking about taking a plane
trip to Hawaii, but the ticket turns out to be expensive during the
week you intend to go, you might consider other weeks when the
ticket might be cheaper. The price could be high because you were
planning to travel during a holiday when demand for traveling is
high. Maybe the cost of an input like jet fuel increased or the
airline has raised the price temporarily to see how many people are
willing to pay it. Perhaps all of these factors are present at the
same time. You do not need to analyze the market and break down the
price change into its underlying factors. You just have to look at
the ticket price and decide whether and when to fly.</p>
<p>In the same way, price changes provide useful information to
producers. Imagine the situation of a farmer who grows</p>
<p>oats and learns that the price of oats has risen. The higher price
could be due to an increase in demand caused by a new scientific
study proclaiming that eating oats is especially healthful. Perhaps
the price of a substitute grain, like corn, has risen, and people
have responded by buying more oats. The oat farmer does not need to
know the details. The farmer only needs to know that the price of
oats has risen and that it will be profitable to expand production
as a result.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark326">The actions of individual consumers and
producers as they react to prices overlap and interlock in markets
for goods, labor, and financial capital. A change in any single
market is transmitted through these multiple interconnections to
other markets. The vision of the role of flexible prices helping
markets to reach equilibrium and linking different markets together
helps to explain why price controls can be so counterproductive.
Price controls are government laws that serve to regulate prices
rather than allow the various markets to determine prices. There is
an old proverb: “Don’t kill the messenger.” In ancient times,
messengers carried information between distant cities and kingdoms.
When they brought bad news, there was an emotional impulse to kill
the messenger. However, killing the messenger did not kill the bad
news. Moreover, killing the messenger had an undesirable side
effect: Other messengers would refuse to bring news to that city or
kingdom, depriving its citizens of vital information.</span></p>

<p>Baby Boomers Come of Age</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark327" class="s84">The theory of supply and demand can explain what happens in the labor markets and suggests that the demand for nurses will increase as healthcare needs of baby boomers increase, as</a>
<span class="s36">Figure 4.10 </span>shows. The impact of that
increase will result in an average salary higher than the $67,490
earned in 2015 referenced in the first part of this case. The new
equilibrium (E<span class="s63">1</span>) will be at the new
equilibrium price (Pe<span class="s63">1</span>).Equilibrium
quantity will also increase from Qe<span class="s63">0</span> to
Qe<span class="s63">1</span>.</p>
<p>Those who seek price controls are trying to kill the messenger—or at
least to stifle an unwelcome message that prices are bringing about
the equilibrium level of price and quantity. However, price controls
do nothing to affect the underlying forces of demand and supply, and
this can have serious repercussions. During China’s “Great Leap
Forward” in the late 1950s, the government kept food prices
artificially low, with the result that 30 to 40 million people died
of starvation because the low prices depressed farm production. This
was communist party leader Mao Zedong’s social and economic campaign
to rapidly transform the country from an agrarian economy to a
socialist society through rapid industrialization and
collectivization. Changes in demand and supply will continue to
reveal themselves through consumers’ and producers’ behavior.
Immobilizing the price messenger through price controls will deprive
everyone in the economy of critical information. Without this
information, it becomes difficult for everyone—buyers and sellers
alike—to react in a flexible and appropriate manner as changes occur
throughout the economy.</p>

<p>KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY</p>
<ol>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark298" class="a">Demand and Supply at Work in Labor</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark298">Markets</a></p>
<p>In the labor market, households are on the supply side of the
market and firms are on the demand side. In the market for
financial capital, households and firms can be on either side of
the market: they are suppliers of financial capital when they
save or make financial investments, and demanders of financial
capital when they borrow or receive financial investments.</p>
<p>In the demand and supply analysis of labor markets, we can
measure the price by the annual salary or hourly wage received.
We can measure the quantity of labor various ways, like number
of workers or the number of hours worked.</p>
<p>Factors that can shift the demand curve for labor include: a
change in the quantity demanded of the product that the labor
produces; a change in the production process that uses more or
less labor; and a change in government policy that affects the
quantity of labor that firms wish to hire at a given wage.
Demand can also increase or decrease (shift) in response to:
workers’ level of education and training, technology, the number
of companies, and availability and price of other inputs.</p>
<p>The main factors that can shift the supply curve for labor are:
how desirable a job appears to workers relative to the
alternatives, government policy that either restricts or
encourages the quantity of workers trained for the job, the
number of workers in the economy, and required education.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark312" class="a">Demand and Supply in Financial</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark312">Markets</a></p>
<p>In the demand and supply analysis of financial markets, the
“price” is the rate of return or the interest rate received. We
measure the quantity by the money that flows from those who
supply financial capital to those who demand it.</p>
<p>Two factors can shift the supply of financial capital to a
certain investment: if people want to alter their existing
levels of consumption, and if the riskiness or return on one
investment changes relative to other investments. Factors that
can shift demand for capital include business confidence and
consumer confidence in the future—since financial investments
received in the present are typically repaid in the future.</p>

<li><p><a href="#bookmark323" class="a">The Market System as an Efficient Mechanism for</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark323">Information</a></p></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The market price system provides a highly efficient mechanism for
disseminating information about relative scarcities of goods, services,
labor, and financial capital. Market participants do not need to know
why prices have changed, only that the changes require them to revisit
previous decisions they made about supply and demand. Price controls
hide information about the true scarcity of products and thereby cause
misallocation of resources.</p>

<p>CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Other than the demand for labor, what would be another example
of a “derived demand?”</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose that a 5% increase in the minimum wage causes a 5%
reduction in employment. How would this affect employers and how
would it affect workers? In your opinion, would this be a good
policy?</p></li>
<li><p>Under what circumstances would a minimum wage be a nonbinding
price floor? Under what circumstances would a living wage be a
binding price floor?</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose the U.S. economy began to grow more rapidly than other
countries in the world. What would be the likely impact on U.S.
financial markets as part of the global economy?</p></li>
<li><p>If the government imposed a federal interest rate ceiling of 20%
on all loans, who would gain and who would lose?</p></li>
<li><p>Why are the factors that shift the demand for a product
different from the factors that shift the demand for labor? Why
are the factors that shift the supply of a product different
from those that shift the supply of labor?</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Whether the product market or the labor market, what happens to the
equilibrium price and quantity for each of the four possibilities:
increase in demand, decrease in demand, increase in supply, and
decrease in supply.</p></li>
<li><p>During a discussion several years ago on building a pipeline to
Alaska to carry natural gas, the U.S. Senate passed a bill
stipulating that there should be a guaranteed minimum price for the
natural gas that would flow through the pipeline. The thinking
behind the bill was that if private firms had a guaranteed price for
their natural gas, they would be more willing to drill for gas and
to pay to build the pipeline.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Using the demand and supply framework, predict the effects of
this price floor on the price, quantity demanded, and quantity
supplied.</p></li>
<li><p>With the enactment of this price floor for natural gas, what are
some of the likely unintended consequences in the market?</p></li>
<li><p>Suggest some policies other than the price floor that the
government can pursue if it wishes to encourage drilling for
natural gas and for a new pipeline in Alaska.</p>

<p>That Will Be How Much?</p>
<p>Imagine going to your favorite coffee shop and having the waiter inform
you the pricing has changed. Instead of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3 for a cup of coffee, you will
now be charged \)</span>2 for coffee, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1 for creamer, and \)</span>1 for your choice of
sweetener. If you pay your usual <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3 for a cup of coffee, you must choose
between creamer and sweetener. If you want both, you now face an extra
charge of \)</span>1. Sound absurd? Well, that is similar to the situation
Netflix customers found themselves in—they faced a 60% price hike to
retain the same service in 2011.</p>
<p>In early 2011, Netflix consumers paid about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10 a month for a package
consisting of streaming video and DVD rentals. In July 2011, the company
announced a packaging change. Customers wishing to retain both streaming
video and DVD rental would be charged \)</span>15.98 per month, a price increase
of about 60%. In 2014, Netflix also raised its streaming video
subscription price from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(7.99 to \)</span>8.99 per month for new U.S. customers.
The company also changed its policy of 4K streaming content from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(9.00
to \)</span>12.00 per month that year.</p>
<p>How would customers of the 18-year-old firm react? Would they abandon
Netflix? Would the ease of access to other venues make a difference in
how consumers responded to the Netflix price change? We will explore the
answers to those questions in this chapter, which focuses on the change
in quantity with respect to a change in price, a concept economists call
elasticity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="introduction-to-elasticity">
<h2>Introduction to Elasticity<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-to-elasticity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In this chapter, you will learn about:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Price Elasticity of Demand and Price Elasticity of Supply</p></li>
<li><p>Polar Cases of Elasticity and Constant Elasticity</p></li>
<li><p>Elasticity and Pricing</p></li>
<li><p>Elasticity in Areas Other Than Price</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Anyone who has studied economics knows the law of demand: a higher price
will lead to a lower quantity demanded. What you may not know is how
much lower the quantity demanded will be. Similarly, the law of supply
states that a higher price will lead to a higher quantity supplied. The
question is: How much higher? This chapter will explain how to answer
these questions and why they are critically important in the real world.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark352">To find answers to these questions, we need to
understand the concept of elasticity.</span> <strong>Elasticity</strong> is an
economics concept that measures responsiveness of one variable to
changes in another variable. Suppose you drop two items from a
second-floor balcony. The first item is a tennis ball. The second item
is a brick. Which will bounce higher? Obviously, the tennis ball. We
would say that the tennis ball has greater elasticity.</p>
<p>Consider an economic example. Cigarette taxes are an example of a “sin
tax,” a tax on something that is bad for you, like alcohol. Governments
tax cigarettes at the state and national levels. State taxes range from
a low of 17 cents per pack in Missouri to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(4.35 per pack in New York.
The average state cigarette tax is \)</span>1.69 per pack. The 2014 federal tax
rate on cigarettes was <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1.01 per pack, but in 2015 the Obama
Administration proposed raising the federal tax nearly a dollar to \)</span>1.95
per pack. The key question is: How much would cigarette purchases
decline?</p>
<p>Taxes on cigarettes serve two purposes: to raise tax revenue for
government and to discourage cigarette consumption. However, if a higher
cigarette tax discourages consumption considerably, meaning a greatly
reduced quantity of cigarette sales, then the cigarette tax on each pack
will not raise much revenue for the government. Alternatively, a higher
cigarette tax that does not discourage consumption by much will actually
raise more tax revenue for the government. Thus, when a government
agency tries to calculate the effects of altering its cigarette tax, it
must analyze how much the tax affects the quantity of cigarettes
consumed. This issue reaches beyond governments and taxes. Every firm
faces a similar issue. When a firm considers raising the sales price, it
must consider how much a price increase will reduce the quantity
demanded of what it sells. Conversely, when a firm puts its products on
sale, it must expect (or hope) that the lower price will lead to a
significantly higher quantity demanded.</p>

<p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Calculate the price elasticity of demand</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate the price elasticity of supply</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span id="bookmark354">Both the demand and supply curve show the
relationship between price and the number of units demanded or
supplied.</span> <strong>Price elasticity</strong> is the ratio between the
percentage change in the quantity demanded (Qd) or supplied (Qs) and
the corresponding percent change in price. The <strong>price elasticity of
demand</strong> is the percentage change in the quantity <em>demanded</em> of a
good or service divided by the percentage change in the price. The
<strong>price elasticity of supply</strong> is the percentage change in quantity
<em>supplied</em> divided by the percentage change in price.<span
id="bookmark355">‌</span><span id="bookmark356">‌</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark357">We can usefully divide elasticities into
three broad categories: elastic, inelastic, and unitary. An</span>
<strong>elastic demand</strong> or <strong>elastic supply</strong> is one in which the
elasticity is greater than one, indicating a high responsiveness to
changes in price. Elasticities that are less than one indicate low
responsiveness to price changes and correspond to <strong>inelastic
demand</strong> or <strong>inelastic supply</strong>. <strong>Unitary elasticities</strong>

<p>To calculate elasticity along a demand or supply curve economists
use the average percent change in both quantity and price. This is
called the Midpoint Method for Elasticity, and is represented in the
following equations:</p>
<p><span class="s69">⎛ </span>Q<span class="s55">2 </span>– Q<span
class="s55">1</span><span class="s69">⎞</span></p>

<p><span id="bookmark362">The advantage of the Midpoint Method is that
one obtains the same elasticity between two price points whether
there is a price increase or decrease. This is because the formula
uses the same base (average quantity and average price) for both

<p>Calculating Price Elasticity of Demand</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark363" class="s34">Let’s calculate the elasticity between points A and B and between points G and H as</a>

<p>Therefore, the elasticity of demand between these two points is
<u>     </u><span class="s74">6.9%</span></p>
<p>–15.4%</p>
<p>which is 0.45, an amount smaller than one,</p>
<p>showing that the demand is inelastic in this interval. Price
elasticities of demand are <em>always</em> negative since price and
quantity demanded always move in opposite directions (on the demand
curve). By convention, we always talk about elasticities as positive
numbers. Mathematically, we take the absolute value of the result.
We will ignore this detail from now on, while remembering to
interpret elasticities as positive numbers.</p>
<p>This means that, along the demand curve between point B and A, if
the price changes by 1%, the quantity demanded will change by 0.45%.
A change in the price will result in a smaller percentage change in
the quantity demanded. For example, a 10% <em>increase</em> in the price
will result in only a 4.5% <em>decrease</em> in quantity demanded. A 10%
<em>decrease</em> in the price will result in only a 4.5% <em>increase</em> in the
quantity demanded. Price elasticities of demand are negative numbers
indicating that the demand curve is downward sloping, but we read
them as absolute values. The following Work It Out feature will walk
you through calculating the price elasticity of demand.</p>

<p>Finding the Price Elasticity of Demand</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark363" class="s84">Calculate the price elasticity of demand using the data in</a>
Figure 5.2 <span class="s37">for an increase in price from G to H.
Has the elasticity increased or decreased?</span></p>
<p>Step 1. We know that:</p>
<p>Price Elasticity of Demand = <u>% change in quantity</u></p>
<p><span id="bookmark364">Step 2. From the Midpoint Formula we know
that:</span></p>
<p><span class="s69">⎛ </span>Q<span class="s55">2</span><span

<p>= 1.47</p>
<p><span id="bookmark365">Therefore, the elasticity of demand from G to

absolute value) as we moved up along the demand curve from points A
to B. Recall that the elasticity between these two points was 0.45.
Demand was inelastic between points A and B and elastic between
points G and H. This shows us that price elasticity of demand
changes at different points along a straight-line demand
curve.</span><span id="bookmark366">‌</span></p>

<p>Is the elasticity the slope?</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark363" class="s84">It is a common mistake to confuse the slope of either the supply or demand curve with its elasticity. The slope is the rate of change in units along the curve, or the rise/run (change in y over the change in x). For example, in</a>
<a href="#bookmark363" class="s43">Figure</a> <span
class="s36">5.2</span>, at each point shown on the demand curve,
price drops by $10 and the number of units demanded increases by 200
compared to the point to its left. The slope is –10/200 along the
entire demand curve and does not change. The price elasticity,
however, changes along the curve. Elasticity between points A and B
was 0.45 and increased to 1.47 between points G and H. Elasticity is
the <em>percentage</em> change, which is a different calculation from the
slope and has a different meaning.</p>
<p>When we are at the upper end of a demand curve, where price is high
and the quantity demanded is low, a small change in the quantity
demanded, even in, say, one unit, is pretty big in percentage terms.
A change</p>
<p>Again, as with the elasticity of demand, the elasticity of supply is
not followed by any units. Elasticity is a ratio of one percentage
change to another percentage change—nothing more—and we read it as
an absolute value. In this case, a 1% rise in price causes an
increase in quantity supplied of 3.5%. The greater than one
elasticity of supply means that the percentage change in quantity
supplied will be greater than a one percent price change. If you’re
starting to wonder if the concept of slope fits into this
calculation, read the following Clear It Up box.</p>
<p>in price of, say, a dollar, is going to be much less important in
percentage terms than it would have been at the bottom of the demand
curve. Likewise, at the bottom of the demand curve, that one unit
change when the quantity demanded is high will be small as a
percentage.</p>
<p>Thus, at one end of the demand curve, where we have a large
percentage change in quantity demanded over a small percentage
change in price, the elasticity value would be high, or demand would
be relatively elastic. Even with the same change in the price and
the same change in the quantity demanded, at the other end of the
demand curve the quantity is much higher, and the price is much
lower, so the percentage change in quantity demanded is smaller and
the percentage change in price is much higher. That means at the
bottom of the curve we’d have a small numerator over a large
denominator, so the elasticity measure would be much lower, or
inelastic.</p>
<p>As we move along the demand curve, the values for quantity and price
go up or down, depending on which way we are moving, so the
percentages for, say, a $1 difference in price or a one unit
difference in quantity, will change as well, which means the ratios
of those percentages and hence the elasticity will change.</p>

</ul>
<p><span id="bookmark370">There are two extreme cases of elasticity:
when elasticity equals zero and when it is infinite. A third case is
that of constant unitary elasticity. We will describe each
case.</span> <strong>Infinite elasticity</strong> or <strong>perfect elasticity</strong>
<a href="#bookmark372" class="s34">refers to the extreme case where either the quantity demanded (Qd) or supplied (Qs) changes by an infinite amount in response to any change in price at all. In both cases, the supply and the demand curve are horizontal as</a>
<a href="#bookmark372" class="a">Figure 5.4</a><span class="s54">
</span>shows. While perfectly elastic supply curves are for the most
part unrealistic, goods with readily available inputs and whose
production can easily expand will feature highly elastic supply
curves. Examples include pizza, bread, books, and pencils.
Similarly, perfectly elastic demand is an extreme example. However,
luxury goods, items that take a large share of individuals’ income,
and goods with many substitutes are likely to have highly elastic
demand curves. Examples of such goods are Caribbean cruises and
sports vehicles.<span id="bookmark371">‌</span></p>

change in quantity. While a perfectly inelastic supply is an extreme

New York City. Similarly,</span></p>
<p>while perfectly inelastic demand is an extreme case, necessities

<p><a href="#bookmark376" id="bookmark375" class="s34">Constant unitary elasticity, in either a supply or demand curve, occurs when a price change of one percent results in a quantity change of one percent.</a>
<a href="#bookmark376" class="a">Figure 5.6</a> <span
class="p">shows a demand curve with constant unit elasticity.
Constant unitary elasticity, in either a supply or demand curve,
occurs when a price change of one percent results in a quantity
change of one percent. Figure 5.6 shows a demand curve with constant
unit elasticity. Using the midpoint method, you can calculate that
between points A and B on the demand curve, the price changes by
28.6% and quantity demanded also changes by 28.6%. Hence, the
elasticity equals 1. Between points B and C, price again changes by
28.6% as does quantity, while between points C and D the
corresponding percentage changes are 22.2% for both price and
quantity. In each case, then, the percentage change in price equals
the percentage change in quantity, and consequently elasticity
equals 1. Notice that in absolute value, the declines in price, as
you step down the demand curve, are not identical. Instead, the
price falls by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2.00 from A to B, by a smaller amount of \)</span>1.50 from
B to C, and by a still smaller amount of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0.90 from C to D. As a
result, a demand curve with constant unitary elasticity moves from a
steeper slope on the left and a flatter slope on the right—and a
curved shape overall. Notice that in absolute value, the declines in
price, as you step down the demand curve, are not identical.

<p>Unlike the demand curve with unitary elasticity, the supply curve
with unitary elasticity is represented by a straight</p>
<p>line, and that line goes through the origin. In each pair of points
on the supply curve there is an equal difference in quantity of 30.
However, in percentage value, using the midpoint method, the steps
are decreasing as one moves from left to right, from 28.6% to 22.2%
to 18.2%, because the quantity points in each percentage calculation
are getting increasingly larger, which expands the denominator in
the elasticity calculation of the percentage change in quantity.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark377" class="s34">Consider the price changes moving up the supply curve in</a>
<a href="#bookmark377" class="a">Figure</a> 5.7<span class="p">.
From points D to E to F and to G on the supply curve, each step of
$1.50 is the same in absolute value. However, if we measure the
price changes in percentage change terms, using the midpoint method,
they are also decreasing, from 28.6% to 22.2% to 18.2%, because the
original price points in each percentage calculation are getting
increasingly larger in value, increasing the denominator in the
calculation of the percentage change in price. Along the constant
unitary elasticity supply curve, the percentage quantity increases
on the horizontal axis exactly match the percentage price increases
on the vertical axis—so this supply curve has a constant unitary
elasticity at all points.</span></p>

<a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/Movietickets" class="s41">article (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/Movietickets)</a>
<span style=" color: #000;">for an example of price elasticity that
may have affected you.</span></p>
<p>Note that demand for necessities such as housing and electricity is
inelastic, while items that are not necessities such as restaurant
meals are more price-sensitive. If the price of a restaurant meal
increases by 10%, the quantity demanded will decrease by 22.7%. A
10% increase in the price of housing will cause only a slight
decrease of 1.2% in the quantity of housing demanded.</p>

<p>Does Raising Price Bring in More Revenue?</p>
<p>Imagine that a band on tour is playing in an indoor arena with
15,000 seats. To keep this example simple, assume that the band
keeps all the money from ticket sales. Assume further that the band
pays the costs for its appearance, but that these costs, like
travel, and setting up the stage, are the same regardless of how
many people are in the audience. Finally, assume that all the
tickets have the same price. (The same insights apply if ticket
prices are more expensive for some seats than for others, but the
calculations become more complicated.) The band knows that it faces
a downward-sloping demand curve; that is, if the band raises the
ticket price and, it will sell fewer seats. How should the band set
the ticket price to generate the most total revenue, which in this
example, because costs are fixed, will also mean the highest profits
for the band? Should the band sell more tickets at a lower price or
fewer tickets at a higher price?</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark380" class="s34">The key concept in thinking about collecting the most revenue is the price elasticity of demand. Total revenue is price times the quantity of tickets sold. Imagine that the band starts off thinking about a certain price, which will result in the sale of a certain quantity of tickets. The three possibilities are in</a>
<a href="#bookmark380" class="a">Table</a> 5.3<span class="p">. If
demand is elastic at that price level, then the band should cut the
price, because the percentage drop in price will result in an even
larger percentage increase in the quantity sold—thus raising total
revenue. However, if demand is inelastic at that original quantity
level, then the band should raise the ticket price, because a
certain percentage increase in price will result in a smaller
percentage decrease in the quantity sold—and total revenue will
rise. If demand has a unitary elasticity at that quantity, then an
equal percentage change in quantity will offset a moderate
percentage change in the price—so the band will earn the same
revenue whether it (moderately) increases or decreases the ticket
price.</span></p>

<p>Table 5.3 <span class="s47">Will the Band Earn More Revenue by
Changing Ticket Prices?</span></p>
<p>What if the band keeps cutting price, because demand is elastic,
until it reaches a level where it sells all 15,000 seats in the
available arena? If demand remains elastic at that quantity, the
band might try to move to a bigger arena, so that it could slash
ticket prices further and see a larger percentage increase in the
quantity of tickets sold. However, if the 15,000-seat arena is all
that is available or if a larger arena would add substantially to
costs, then this option may not work.</p>
<p>Conversely, a few bands are so famous, or have such fanatical
followings, that demand for tickets may be inelastic right up to the
point where the arena is full. These bands can, if they wish, keep
raising the ticket price. Ironically,</p>
<p>some of the most popular bands could make more revenue by setting
prices so high that the arena is not full—but those who buy the
tickets would have to pay very high prices. However, bands sometimes
choose to sell tickets for less than the absolute maximum they might
be able to charge, often in the hope that fans will feel happier and
spend more on recordings, T-shirts, and other paraphernalia.</p>
<p>Can Businesses Pass Costs on to Consumers?</p>
<p><span id="bookmark381">Most businesses face a day-to-day struggle to
figure out ways to produce at a lower cost, as one pathway to their
goal of earning higher profits. However, in some cases, the price of
a key input over which the firm has no control may rise. For
example, many chemical companies use petroleum as a key input, but
they have no control over the world market price for crude oil.
Coffee shops use coffee as a key input, but they have no control
over the world market price of coffee. If the cost of a key input
rises, can the firm pass those higher costs along to consumers in
the form of higher prices? Conversely, if new and less expensive
ways of producing are invented, can the firm keep the benefits in
the form of higher profits, or will the market pressure them to pass
the gains along to consumers in the form of lower prices? The price
elasticity of demand plays a key role in answering these
questions.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark382" class="s34">Imagine that as a consumer of legal pharmaceutical products, you read a newspaper story that a technological breakthrough in the production of aspirin has occurred, so that every aspirin factory can now produce aspirin more cheaply. What does this discovery mean to you?</a>
<a href="#bookmark382" class="a">Figure 5.8</a><span class="s54">
</span><a href="#bookmark382" class="s34">illustrates two possibilities. In</a>
<a href="#bookmark382" class="a">Figure 5.8</a><span class="s54">
</span>(a), the demand curve is highly inelastic. In this case, a
technological breakthrough that shifts supply to the right, from

the equilibrium shifts from E<span class="s60">0</span> to E<span

<a href="#bookmark382" class="a">Figure 5.8</a><span class="s54">
</span>(b), the demand curve is highly elastic. In this case, the
technological breakthrough leads to a much greater quantity sold in
the market at very close to the original price. Consumers benefit
more, in general, when the demand curve is more inelastic because
the shift in the supply results in a much lower price for consumers.</p>

<p><span id="bookmark382"><span class="s36">Figure 5.8 Passing along
Cost Savings to Consumers </span></span>Cost-saving gains cause
supply to shift out to the right from S<span class="s63">0</span> to
S<span class="s63">1</span>; that is, at any given price, firms will
be willing to supply a greater quantity. If demand is inelastic, as
in (a), the result of this cost-saving technological improvement
will be substantially lower prices. If demand is elastic, as in (b),
the result will be only slightly lower prices. Consumers benefit in
either case, from a greater quantity at a lower price, but the
benefit is greater when demand is inelastic, as in (a).</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark382" class="s34">Aspirin producers may find themselves in a nasty bind here. The situation in</a>
<a href="#bookmark382" class="a">Figure</a> 5.8<span class="p">,
with extremely inelastic demand, means that a new invention may
cause the price to drop dramatically while quantity changes little.
As a result, the new production technology can lead to a drop in the
revenue that firms earn from aspirin sales. However, if strong
competition exists between aspirin producer, each producer may have
little choice but to search for and implement any breakthrough that
allows it to reduce production costs. After all, if one firm decides
not to implement such a cost-saving technology, other firms that do
can drive them out of business.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark382" class="s34">Since demand for food is generally inelastic, farmers may often face the situation in</a>
<a href="#bookmark382" class="a">Figure 5.8</a> <span class="p">(a).
That is, a surge in</span></p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_124.png" width="624" height="51" alt="image" />
<p>production leads to a severe drop in price that can actually
decrease the total revenue that farmers receive. Conversely, poor
weather or other conditions that cause a terrible year for farm
production can sharply raise prices so that the total revenue that
the farmer receives increases. The Clear It Up box discusses how
these issues relate to coffee.</p>
<p>How do coffee prices fluctuate?</p>
<p>Coffee is an international crop. The top five coffee-exporting
nations are Brazil, Vietnam, Colombia, Indonesia, and Ethiopia. In
these nations and others, 20 million families depend on selling
coffee beans as their main source of income. These families are
exposed to enormous risk, because the world price of coffee bounces
up and down. For example, in 1993, the world price of coffee was
about 50 cents per pound. In 1995 it was four times as high, at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2
per pound. By 1997 it had fallen by half to \)</span>1.00 per pound. In 1998
it leaped back up to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2 per pound. By 2001 it had fallen back to 46
cents a pound. By early 2011 it rose to about \)</span>2.31 per pound. By
the end of 2012, the price had fallen back to about $1.31 per pound.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark382" class="s84">The reason for these price fluctuations lies in a combination of inelastic demand and shifts in supply. The elasticity of coffee demand is only about 0.3; that is, a 10% rise in the price of coffee leads to a decline of about 3% in the quantity of coffee consumed. When a major frost hit the Brazilian coffee crop in 1994, coffee supply shifted to the left with an inelastic demand curve, leading to much higher prices. Conversely, when Vietnam entered the world coffee market as a major producer in the late 1990s, the supply curve shifted out to the right. With a highly inelastic demand curve, coffee prices fell dramatically.</a>
Figure 5.8 <span class="s37">(a) illustrates this situation.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark383" class="s34">Elasticity also reveals whether firms can pass higher costs that they incur on to consumers. Addictive substances, for which demand is inelastic, are products for which producers can pass higher costs on to consumers. For example, the demand for cigarettes is relatively inelastic among regular smokers who are somewhat addicted. Economic research suggests that increasing cigarette prices by 10% leads to about a 3% reduction in the quantity of cigarettes that adults smoke, so the elasticity of demand for cigarettes is 0.3. If society increases taxes on companies that produce cigarettes, the result will be, as in</a>

</span>(a), that the supply curve shifts from S<span
class="s60">0</span> to S<span class="s60">1</span>. However, as the
equilibrium moves from E<span class="s60">0</span> to E<span
class="s60">1</span>, governments mainly pass along these taxes to
consumers in the form of higher prices. These higher taxes on
cigarettes will raise tax revenue for the government, but they will
not much affect the quantity of smoking.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark383" class="s34">If the goal is to reduce the quantity of cigarettes demanded, we must achieve it by shifting this inelastic demand back to the left, perhaps with public programs to discourage cigarette use or to help people to quit. For example, anti-smoking advertising campaigns have shown some ability to reduce smoking. However, if cigarette demand were more elastic, as in</a>
<a href="#bookmark383" class="a">Figure 5.9</a><span class="s54">
</span>(b), then an increase in taxes that shifts supply from S<span
class="s60">0</span> to S<span class="s60">1</span> and equilibrium
from E<span class="s60">0</span> to E<span class="s60">1</span>
would reduce the quantity of cigarettes smoked substantially. Youth
smoking seems to be more elastic than adult smoking—that is, the
quantity of youth smoking will fall by a greater percentage than the
quantity of adult smoking in response to a given percentage increase
in price.</p>

<p><span id="bookmark383">Figure 5.9 Passing along Higher Costs to
Consumers</span> <span class="s37">Higher costs, like a higher tax
on cigarette companies for the example we gave in the text, lead
supply to shift to the left. This shift is identical in (a) and (b).
However, in (a), where demand is inelastic, companies largely can
pass the cost increase along to consumers in the form of higher
prices, without much of a decline in equilibrium quantity. In (b),
demand is elastic, so the shift in supply results primarily in a
lower equilibrium quantity. Consumers suffer in either case, but in
(a), they suffer from paying a higher price for the same quantity,
while in (b), they suffer from buying a lower quantity (and
presumably needing to shift their consumption elsewhere).</span></p>
<p>Elasticity and Tax Incidence</p>
<p><span id="bookmark384">The example of cigarette taxes demonstrated
that because demand is inelastic, taxes are not effective at
reducing the equilibrium quantity of smoking, and they mainly pass
along to consumers in the form of higher prices. The analysis, or
manner, of how a tax burden is divided between consumers and
producers is called</span> <strong>tax incidence</strong>. Typically, the tax
incidence, or burden, falls both on the consumers and producers of
the taxed good. However, if one wants to predict which group will
bear most of the burden, all one needs to do is examine the
elasticity of demand and supply. In the tobacco example, the tax
burden falls on the most inelastic side of the market.</p>
<p>If demand is more inelastic than supply, consumers bear most of the
tax burden, and if supply is more inelastic than demand, sellers
bear most of the tax burden.</p>
<p>The intuition for this is simple. When the demand is inelastic,
consumers are not very responsive to price changes, and the quantity
demanded reduces only modestly when the tax is introduced. In the
case of smoking, the demand is inelastic because consumers are
addicted to the product. The government can then pass the tax burden
along to consumers in the form of higher prices, without much of a
decline in the equilibrium quantity.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark385" class="s34">Similarly, when a government introduces a tax in a market with an inelastic supply, such as, for example, beachfront hotels, and sellers have no alternative than to accept lower prices for their business, taxes do not greatly affect the equilibrium quantity. The tax burden now passes on to the sellers. If the supply was elastic and sellers had the possibility of reorganizing their businesses to avoid supplying the taxed good, the tax burden on the sellers would be much smaller. The tax would result in a much lower quantity sold instead of lower prices received.</a>
<a href="#bookmark385" class="a">Figure</a> 5.10 <span
class="p">illustrates this relationship between the tax incidence
and elasticity of demand and supply.</span></p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_126.jpg" width="530" height="250" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark385">Figure 5.10 Elasticity and Tax
Incidence</span> <span class="s37">An excise tax introduces a wedge
between the price paid by consumers (Pc) and the price received by
producers (Pp). The vertical distance between Pc and Pp is the
amount of the tax per unit. Pe is the equilibrium price prior to
introduction of the tax. (a) When the demand is more elastic than
supply, the tax incidence on consumers Pc – Pe is lower than the tax
incidence on producers Pe – Pp. (b) When the supply is more elastic
than demand, the tax incidence on consumers Pc – Pe is larger than
the tax incidence on producers Pe</span></p>
<p>– Pp. The more elastic the demand and supply curves, the lower the
tax revenue.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark385" class="s34">In</a>
<a href="#bookmark385" class="a">Figure 5.10</a>
<a href="#bookmark385" class="s34">(a), the supply is inelastic and the demand is elastic, such as in the example of beachfront hotels. While consumers may have other vacation choices, sellers can’t easily move their businesses. By introducing a tax, the government essentially creates a wedge between the price paid by consumers Pc and the price received by producers Pp. In other words, of the total price paid by consumers, part is retained by the sellers and part is paid to the government in the form of a tax. The distance between Pc and Pp is the tax rate. The new market price is Pc, but sellers receive only Pp per unit sold, as they pay Pc-Pp to the government. Since we can view a tax as raising the costs of production, this could also be represented by a leftward shift of the supply curve, where the new supply curve would intercept the demand at the new quantity Qt. For simplicity,</a>
<a href="#bookmark385" class="a">Figure 5.10</a> <span
class="p">omits the shift in the supply curve.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark385" class="s34">The tax revenue is given by the shaded area, which we obtain by multiplying the tax per unit by the total quantity sold Qt. The tax incidence on the consumers is given by the difference between the price paid Pc and the initial equilibrium price Pe. The tax incidence on the sellers is given by the difference between the initial equilibrium price Pe and the price they receive after the tax is introduced Pp. In</a>
<a href="#bookmark385" class="a">Figure 5.10</a>
<a href="#bookmark385" class="s34">(a), the tax burden falls disproportionately on the sellers, and a larger proportion of the tax revenue (the shaded area) is due to the resulting lower price received by the sellers than by the resulting higher prices paid by the buyers.</a>
<a href="#bookmark385" class="a">Figure 5.10</a> <span class="p">(b)
describes the example of the tobacco excise tax where the supply is
more elastic than demand. The tax incidence now falls
disproportionately on consumers, as shown by the large difference
between the price they pay, Pc, and the initial equilibrium price,
Pe. Sellers receive a lower price than before the tax, but this
difference is much smaller than the change in consumers’ price. From
this analysis one can also predict whether a tax is likely to create
a large revenue or not. The more elastic the demand curve, the more
likely that consumers will reduce quantity instead of paying higher
prices. The more elastic the supply curve, the more likely that
sellers will reduce the quantity sold, instead of taking lower
prices. In a market where both the demand and supply are very
elastic, the imposition of an excise tax generates low
revenue.</span></p>
<p>Some believe that excise taxes hurt mainly the specific industries
they target. For example, the medical device excise tax, in effect
since 2013, has been controversial for it can delay industry
profitability and therefore hamper start- ups and medical
innovation. However, whether the tax burden falls mostly on the
medical device industry or on the patients depends simply on the
elasticity of demand and supply.</p>
<p>Long-Run vs. Short-Run Impact</p>
<p>Elasticities are often lower in the short run than in the long run.
On the demand side of the market, it can sometimes be difficult to
change Qd in the short run, but easier in the long run. Consumption
of energy is a clear example. In the short run, it is not easy for a
person to make substantial changes in energy consumption. Maybe you
can carpool to work sometimes or adjust your home thermostat by a
few degrees if the cost of energy rises, but that is about all.</p>
<p>However, in the long run you can purchase a car that gets more miles
to the gallon, choose a job that is closer to where you live, buy
more energy-efficient home appliances, or install more insulation in
your home. As a result, the elasticity of demand for energy is
somewhat inelastic in the short run, but much more elastic in the
long run.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark386" class="a">Figure 5.11</a>
<a href="#bookmark386" class="s34">is an example, based roughly on historical experience, for the responsiveness of Qd to price changes. In 1973, the price of crude oil was $12 per barrel and total consumption in the U.S. economy was 17 million barrels per day. That year, the nations who were members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) cut off oil exports to the United States for six months because the Arab members of OPEC disagreed with the U.S. support for Israel. OPEC did not bring exports back to their earlier levels until 1975—a policy that we can interpret as a shift of the supply curve to the left in the U.S. petroleum market.</a>

either in a new equilibrium with a much higher price and an only
slightly smaller quantity, as in (a), with more inelastic demand, or
in a new equilibrium with only a small increase in price and a
relatively larger reduction in quantity, as in (b), with more
elastic demand.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark386" class="a">Figure 5.11</a>
<a href="#bookmark386" class="s34">(a) shows inelastic demand for oil in the short run similar to that which existed for the United States in 1973. In</a>

class="s60">1</span><a href="#bookmark386" class="s34">) occurs at a price of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(25 per barrel, roughly double the price before the OPEC shock, and an equilibrium quantity of 16 million barrels per day.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;#bookmark386&quot; class=&quot;a&quot;&gt;Figure&lt;/a&gt; 5.11 &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(b)
shows what the outcome would have been if the U.S. demand for oil
had been more elastic, a result more likely over the long term. This
alternative equilibrium (E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s60&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;) would have resulted in a smaller price increase to \)</span>14
per barrel and larger reduction in equilibrium quantity to 13
million barrels per day. In 1983, for example, U.S. petroleum
consumption was 15.3 million barrels a day, which was lower than in
1973 or 1975. U.S. petroleum consumption was down even though
the</span></p>
<p>U.S. economy was about one-fourth larger in 1983 than it had been
in 1973. The primary reason for the lower quantity was that higher
energy prices spurred conservation efforts, and after a decade of
home insulation, more fuel-efficient cars, more efficient appliances
and machinery, and other fuel-conserving choices, the demand curve
for energy had become more elastic.</p>
<p>On the supply side of markets, producers of goods and services
typically find it easier to expand production in the long term of
several years rather than in the short run of a few months. After
all, in the short run it can be costly or difficult to build a new
factory, hire many new workers, or open new stores. However, over a
few years, all of these are possible.</p>
<p>In most markets for goods and services, prices bounce up and down
more than quantities in the short run, but quantities often move
more than prices in the long run. The underlying reason for this
pattern is that supply and demand are often inelastic in the short
run, so that shifts in either demand or supply can cause a
relatively greater</p>
<p>change in prices. However, since supply and demand are more elastic
in the long run, the long-run movements in prices are more muted,
while quantity adjusts more easily in the long run.</p>

style=" color: #3767B1;">Elasticity in Areas Other Than
Price</span><span id="bookmark387">‌</span></p>
<p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Calculate the income elasticity of demand and the cross-price
elasticity of demand</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate the elasticity in labor and financial capital markets
through an understanding of the elasticity of labor supply and
the elasticity of savings</p></li>
<li><p>Apply concepts of price elasticity to real-world situations</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The basic idea of elasticity—how a percentage change in one variable
causes a percentage change in another variable—does not just apply
to the responsiveness quantity supplied and quantity demanded to
changes in the price of a product. Recall that quantity demanded
(Qd) depends on income, tastes and preferences, the prices of
related goods, and so on, as well as price. Similarly, quantity
supplied (Qs) depends on factors such as the cost of production, as
well as price. We can measure elasticity for any determinant of
quantity supplied and quantity demanded, not just the price.</p>
<p>Income Elasticity of Demand</p>
<p><span id="bookmark388">The income elasticity of demand is the
percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage
change in income.</span></p>
<p>Income elasticity of demand = <u>% change in quantity demanded</u></p>
<p><span id="bookmark389">For most products, most of the time, the
income elasticity of demand is positive: that is, a rise in income
will cause an increase in the quantity demanded. This pattern is
common enough that we refer to these goods as normal goods. However,
for a few goods, an increase in income means that one might purchase
less of the good. For example, those with a higher income might buy
fewer hamburgers, because they are buying more steak instead, or
those with a higher income might buy less cheap wine and more
imported beer. When the income elasticity of demand is negative, we
call the good an inferior good.</span><span
id="bookmark390">‌</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark159" class="s34">We introduced the concepts of normal and inferior goods in</a>
<a href="#bookmark159" class="a">Demand and</a> Supply<span
class="p">. A higher level of income causes a demand curve to shift
to the right for a normal good, which means that the income
elasticity of demand is positive. How far the demand shifts depends
on the income elasticity of demand. A higher income elasticity means
a larger shift. However, for an inferior good, that is, when the
income elasticity of demand is negative, a higher level of income
would cause the demand curve for that good to shift to the left.
Again, how much it shifts depends on how large the (negative) income
elasticity is.</span></p>
<p>Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand</p>
<p>A change in the price of one good can shift the quantity demanded
for another good. If the two goods are complements, like bread and
peanut butter, then a drop in the price of one good will lead to an
increase in the quantity demanded of the other good. However, if the
two goods are substitutes, like plane tickets and train tickets,
then a drop in the price of one good will cause people to substitute
toward that good, and to reduce consumption of the other good.
Cheaper plane tickets lead to fewer train tickets, and vice versa.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark391">The</span> <strong>cross-price elasticity of
demand</strong> puts some meat on the bones of these ideas. The term
“cross-price” refers to the idea that the price of one good is
affecting the quantity demanded of a different good. Specifically,
the cross-price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in the
quantity of good A that is demanded as a result of a percentage
change in the price of good B.</p>
<p>Cross-price elasticity of demand = <u>% change in Qd of good A  </u></p>
<p>Substitute goods have positive cross-price elasticities of demand:
if good A is a substitute for good B, like coffee and tea, then a
higher price for B will mean a greater quantity consumed of A.
Complement goods have negative cross- price elasticities: if good A
is a complement for good B, like coffee and sugar, then a higher
price for B will mean a</p>
<p>lower quantity consumed of A.</p>
<p>Elasticity in Labor and Financial Capital Markets</p>
<p><span id="bookmark392">The concept of elasticity applies to any
market, not just markets for goods and services. In the labor
market, for example, the</span> <strong>wage elasticity of labor
supply</strong>—that is, the percentage change in hours worked divided by
the percentage change in wages—will reflect the shape of the labor
supply curve. Specifically:</p>
<p>Elasticity of labor supply = <u>% change in quantity of labor
supplied</u></p>
<p>The wage elasticity of labor supply for teenage workers is generally
fairly elastic: that is, a certain percentage change in wages will
lead to a larger percentage change in the quantity of hours worked.
Conversely, the wage elasticity of labor supply for adult workers in
their thirties and forties is fairly inelastic. When wages move up
or down by a certain percentage amount, the quantity of hours that
adults in their prime earning years are willing to supply changes
but by a lesser percentage amount.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark393">In markets for financial capital, the</span>
<strong>elasticity of savings</strong>—that is, the percentage change in the
quantity of savings divided by the percentage change in interest
rates—will describe the shape of the supply curve for financial
capital. That is:</p>
<p>Elasticity of savings =</p>
<p>Sometimes laws are proposed that seek to increase the quantity of
savings by offering tax breaks so that the return on savings is
higher. Such a policy will have a comparatively large impact on
increasing the quantity saved if the supply curve for financial
capital is elastic, because then a given percentage increase in the
return to savings will cause a higher percentage increase in the
quantity of savings. However, if the supply curve for financial
capital is highly inelastic, then a percentage increase in the
return to savings will cause only a small increase in the quantity
of savings. The evidence on the supply curve of financial capital is
controversial but, at least in the short run, the elasticity of
savings with respect to the interest rate appears fairly inelastic.</p>
<p>Expanding the Concept of Elasticity</p>
<p>The elasticity concept does not even need to relate to a typical
supply or demand curve at all. For example, imagine that you are
studying whether the Internal Revenue Service should spend more
money on auditing tax returns. We can frame the question in terms of
the elasticity of tax collections with respect to spending on tax
enforcement; that is, what is the percentage change in tax
collections derived from a given percentage change in spending on
tax enforcement?</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark394" class="s34">With all of the elasticity concepts that we have just described, some of which are in</a>
<a href="#bookmark394" class="a">Table</a> 5.4<span class="p">, the
possibility of confusion arises. When you hear the phrases
“elasticity of demand” or “elasticity of supply,” they refer to the
elasticity with respect to price. Sometimes, either to be extremely
clear or because economists are discussing a wide variety of
elasticities, we will call the elasticity of demand or the demand
elasticity the price elasticity of demand or the “elasticity of
demand with respect to price.” Similarly, economists sometimes use
the term elasticity of supply or the supply elasticity, to avoid any
possibility of confusion, the price elasticity of supply or “the
elasticity of supply with respect to price.” However, in whatever
context, the idea of elasticity always refers to percentage change
in one variable, almost always a price or money variable, and how it
causes a percentage change in another variable, typically a quantity
variable of some kind.</span></p>

Elasticity</span></p>
<p>That Will Be How Much?</p>
<p>How did the 60% price increase in 2011 end up for Netflix? It has
been a very bumpy ride.</p>
<p>Before the price increase, there were about 24.6 million U.S.
subscribers. After the price increase, 810,000 infuriated U.S.
consumers canceled their Netflix subscriptions, dropping the total
number of subscribers to</p>
<p>23.79 million. Fast forward to June 2013, when there were 36 million
streaming Netflix subscribers in the United States. This was an
increase of 11.4 million subscribers since the price increase—an
average per quarter growth of about 1.6 million. This growth is less
than the 2 million per quarter increases Netflix experienced in the
fourth quarter of 2010 and the first quarter of 2011.</p>
<p>During the first year after the price increase, the firm’s stock
price (a measure of future expectations for the firm) fell from
about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(33.60 per share per share to just under \)</span>7.80. By the end of
2016, however, the stock price was at $123 per share. Today, Netflix
has more than 86 million subscribers million subscribers in fifty
countries.</p>
<p>What happened? Obviously, Netflix company officials understood the
law of demand. Company officials reported, when announcing the price
increase, this could result in the loss of about 600,000 existing
subscribers. Using the elasticity of demand formula, it is easy to
see company officials expected an inelastic response:</p>
<p>=</p>
<p>–600,000/[(24 million + 24.6 million)/2]</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(6/\[(\)</span>10 + $16)/2]</p>
<p>=</p>
<p>–600,000/24.3 million</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(6/\)</span>13</p>
<p>=</p>
<p>–0.025</p>
<p>0.46</p>
<p>= –0.05</p>
<p>In addition, Netflix officials had anticipated the price increase
would have little impact on attracting new customers. Netflix
anticipated adding up to 1.29 million new subscribers in the third
quarter of 2011. It is true this was slower growth than the firm had
experienced—about 2 million per quarter.</p>
<p>Why was the estimate of customers leaving so far off? In the more
than two decades since Netflix had been founded, there was an
increase in the number of close, but not perfect, substitutes.
Consumers now had choices ranging from Vudu, Amazon Prime, Hulu, and
Redbox, to retail stores. Jaime Weinman reported in <em>Maclean’s</em> that
Redbox kiosks are “a five-minute drive for less from 68 percent of
Americans, and it seems that many people still find a five-minute
drive more convenient than loading up a movie online.” It seems that
in 2012, many consumers still preferred a physical DVD disk over
streaming video.</p>
<p>What missteps did the Netflix management make? In addition to
misjudging the elasticity of demand, by failing</p>
<p>to account for close substitutes, it seems they may have also
misjudged customers’ preferences and tastes. Yet, as the population
increases, the preference for streaming video may overtake physical
DVD disks. Netflix, the source of numerous late night talk show
laughs and jabs in 2011, may yet have the last laugh.</p>

<p>KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY</p>
<ol>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark353" class="a">Price Elasticity of Demand and Price Elasticity of</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark353">Supply</a></p>
<p>Price elasticity measures the responsiveness of the quantity
demanded or supplied of a good to a change in its price. We
compute it as the percentage change in quantity demanded (or
supplied) divided by the percentage change in price. We can
describe elasticity as elastic (or very responsive), unit
elastic, or inelastic (not very responsive). Elastic demand or
supply curves indicate that quantity demanded or supplied
respond to price changes in a greater than proportional manner.
An inelastic demand or supply curve is one where a given
percentage change in price will cause a smaller percentage
change in quantity demanded or supplied. A unitary elasticity
means that a given percentage change in price leads to an equal
percentage change in quantity demanded or supplied.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark369" class="a">Polar Cases of Elasticity and Constant</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark369">Elasticity</a></p>
<p>Infinite or perfect elasticity refers to the extreme case where
either the quantity demanded or supplied changes by an infinite
amount in response to any change in price at all. Zero
elasticity refers to the extreme case in which a percentage
change in price, no matter how large, results in zero change in
quantity. Constant unitary elasticity in either a supply or
demand curve refers to a situation where a price change of one
percent results in a quantity change of one percent.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark378" class="a">Elasticity and</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark378">Pricing</a></p>
<p>In the market for goods and services, quantity supplied and
quantity demanded are often relatively slow to react to changes
in price in the short run, but react more substantially in the
long run. As a result, demand and supply often (but not always)
tend to be relatively inelastic in the short run and relatively
elastic in the long run. A tax incidence depends on the relative
price elasticity of supply and demand. When supply is more
elastic than demand, buyers bear most of the tax burden, and
when demand is more elastic than supply, producers bear most of
the cost of the tax. Tax revenue is larger the more inelastic
the demand and supply are.</p>

<p>Elasticity is a general term, that reflects responsiveness. It refers to
the change of one variable divided by the percentage change of a related
variable that we can apply to many economic connections. For instance,
the income elasticity of demand is the percentage change in quantity
demanded divided by the percentage change in income. The cross-price
elasticity of demand is the percentage change in the quantity demanded
of a good divided by the percentage change in the price of another good.
Elasticity applies in labor markets and financial capital markets just
as it does in markets for goods and services. The wage elasticity of
labor supply is the percentage change in the quantity of hours supplied
divided by the percentage change in the wage. The elasticity of savings
with respect to interest rates is the percentage change in the quantity
of savings divided by the percentage change in interest rates.</p>

the employers’ demand for such workers is fairly inelastic. If the
policy goal is to expand employment for low-skilled workers, is it
better to focus on policy tools to shift the supply of unskilled

<p>How is the Economy Doing? How Does One Tell?</p>
<p>The 1990s were boom years for the U.S. economy. Beginning in the late
2000s, from 2007 to 2014 economic performance in in the U.S. was poor.
What causes the economy to expand or contract? Why do businesses fail
when they are making all the right decisions? Why do workers lose their
jobs when they are hardworking and productive? Are bad economic times a
failure of the market system? Are they a failure of the government?
These are all questions of macroeconomics, which we will begin to
address in this chapter. We will not be able to answer all of these
questions here, but we will start with the basics: How is the economy
doing? How can we tell?</p>
<p>The macro economy includes all buying and selling, all production and
consumption; everything that goes on in every market in the economy. How
can we get a handle on that? The answer begins more than 80 years ago,
during the Great Depression. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his
economic advisers knew things were bad—but how could they express and
measure just how bad it was? An economist named Simon Kuznets, who later
won the Nobel Prize for his work, came up with a way to track what the
entire economy is producing. In this chapter, you will learn how the
government constructs GDP, how we use it, and why it is so important.</p>

is more difficult to ascertain how the economy of a country is doing.

<h2>Introduction to the Macroeconomic Perspective<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-to-the-macroeconomic-perspective" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In this chapter, you will learn about:</p>
<ul class="simple">

<li><p>Adjusting Nominal Values to Real Values</p></li>

</ul>
<p>Macroeconomics focuses on the economy as a whole (or on whole economies
as they interact). What causes recessions? What makes unemployment stay
high when recessions are supposed to be over? Why do some countries grow
faster than others? Why do some countries have higher standards of
living than others? These are all questions that macroeconomics
addresses. Macroeconomics involves adding up the economic activity of
all households and all businesses in all markets to obtain the overall
demand and supply in the economy. However, when we do that, something
curious happens. It is not unusual that what results at the macro level
is different from the sum of the microeconomic parts. What seems
sensible from a microeconomic point of view can have unexpected or
counterproductive results at the macroeconomic level. Imagine that you
are sitting at an event with a large audience, like a live concert or a
basketball game. A few people decide that they want a better view, and
so they stand up. However, when these people stand up, they block the
view for other people, and the others need to stand up as well if they
wish to see. Eventually, nearly everyone is standing up, and as a
result, no one can see much better than before. The rational decision of
some individuals at the micro level—to stand up for a better view—ended
up as self-defeating at the macro level. This is not macroeconomics, but
it is an apt analogy.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark433" class="s34">Macroeconomics is a rather massive subject. How are we going to tackle it?</a>
<a href="#bookmark433" class="a">Figure 6.2</a> <span
class="p">illustrates the structure we will use. We will study
macroeconomics from three different perspectives:</span></p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>What are the macroeconomic goals? (Macroeconomics as a discipline
does not have goals, but we do have goals for the macro economy.)</p></li>
<li><p>What are the frameworks economists can use to analyze the
macroeconomy?</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, what are the policy tools governments can use to manage the
macroeconomy?</p></li>
</ol>

<p><span id="bookmark433">Figure 6.2 Macroeconomic Goals, Framework, and
Policies</span> <span class="s37">This chart shows what macroeconomics
is about. The box on the left indicates a consensus of what are the most
important goals for the macro economy, the middle box lists the
frameworks economists use to analyze macroeconomic changes (such as
inflation or recession), and the box on the right indicates the two
tools the federal government uses to influence the macro economy.</span></p>
<p>Goals</p>
<p>In thinking about the macroeconomy’s overall health, it is useful to
consider three primary goals: economic growth, low unemployment, and low
inflation.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Economic growth ultimately determines the prevailing standard of
living in a country. Economists measure growth by the percentage
change in real (inflation-adjusted) gross domestic product. A growth
rate of more than 3% is considered good.</p></li>
<li><p>Unemployment, as measured by the unemployment rate, is the
percentage of people in the labor force who do not have a job. When
people lack jobs, the economy is wasting a precious resource-labor,
and the result is</p>
<p>lower goods and services produced. Unemployment, however, is more
than a statistic—it represents people’s livelihoods. While measured
unemployment is unlikely to ever be zero, economists consider a
measured unemployment rate of 5% or less low (good).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Inflation is a sustained increase in the overall level of prices,
and is measured by the consumer price index. If many people face a
situation where the prices that they pay for food, shelter, and
healthcare are rising much faster than the wages they receive for
their labor, there will be widespread unhappiness as their standard
of living declines. For that reason, low inflation—an inflation rate
of 1–2%—is a major goal.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Frameworks</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark14" id="bookmark434" class="s34">As you learn in the micro part of this book, principal tools that economists use are theories and models (see</a>
<a href="#bookmark14" class="a">Welcome to Economics!</a> <span
class="p">for more on this). In microeconomics, we used the theories of
supply and demand. In macroeconomics, we use the theories of aggregate
demand (AD) and aggregate supply (AS). This book presents two
perspectives on macroeconomics: the Neoclassical perspective and the
Keynesian perspective, each of which has its own version of AD and AS.
Between the two perspectives, you will obtain a good understanding of
what drives the macroeconomy.</span></p>
<p>Policy Tools</p>
<p>National governments have two tools for influencing the macroeconomy.
The first is monetary policy, which involves managing the money supply
and interest rates. The second is fiscal policy, which involves changes
in government spending/purchases and taxes.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark433" class="s34">We will explain each of the items in</a>
<a href="#bookmark433" class="a">Figure 6.2</a> <span class="p">in
detail in one or more other chapters. As you learn these things, you
will discover that the goals and the policy tools are in the news almost
every day.</span></p>

style=" color: #3767B1;">Measuring the Size of the Economy: Gross
Domestic Product</span><span id="bookmark435">‌</span></p>
<p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Identify the components of GDP on the demand side and on the
supply side</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate how economists measure gross domestic product (GDP)</p></li>
<li><p>Contrast and calculate GDP, net exports, and net national
product</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Macroeconomics is an empirical subject, so the first step toward
understanding it is to measure the economy.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark436">How large is the U.S. economy? Economists
typically measure the size of a nation’s overall economy by
its</span> <strong>gross domestic product (GDP)</strong>, which is the value of
all final goods and services produced within a country in a given
year. Measuring GDP involves counting the production of millions of
different goods and services—smart phones, cars, music downloads,
computers, steel, bananas, college educations, and all other new
goods and services that a country produced in the current year—and
summing them into a total dollar value. This task is
straightforward: take the quantity of everything produced, multiply
it by the price at which each product sold, and add up the total. In
2016, the U.S. GDP totaled $18.6 trillion, the largest GDP in the
world.</p>
<p>Each of the market transactions that enter into GDP must involve
both a buyer and a seller. We can measure an economy’s GDP either by
the total dollar value of what consumers purchase in the economy, or
by the total dollar value of what is the country produces. There is
even a third way, as we will explain later.</p>
<p>GDP Measured by Components of Demand</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark438" id="bookmark437" class="s34">Who buys all of this production? We can divide this demand into four main parts: consumer spending (consumption), business spending (investment), government spending on goods and services, and spending on net exports. (See the following Clear It Up feature to understand what we mean by investment.)</a>
<a href="#bookmark438" class="a">Table 6.1</a>

<p>What does the word “investment” mean?</p>
<p>What do economists mean by investment, or business spending? In
calculating GDP, investment does not refer to purchasing stocks and
bonds or trading financial assets. It refers to purchasing new
capital goods, that is, new commercial real estate (such as
buildings, factories, and stores) and equipment, residential housing
construction, and inventories. Inventories that manufacturers
produce this year are included in this year’s GDP—even if they are
not yet sold. From the accountant’s perspective, it is as if the
firm invested in its own inventories. Business investment in 2016
was $3 trillion, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.</p>

<p><span id="bookmark439">Figure 6.4 Components of GDP on the Demand
Side</span>
<a href="http://bea.gov/iTable/index_nipa.cfm)" class="s84">(a) Consumption is about two-thirds of GDP, and it has been on a slight upward trend over time. Business investment hovers around 15% of GDP, but it fluctuates more than consumption. Government spending on goods and services is slightly under 20% of GDP and has declined modestly over time. (b) Exports are added to total demand for goods and services, while imports are subtracted from total demand. If exports exceed imports, as in most of the 1960s and 1970s in the U.S. economy, a trade surplus exists. If imports exceed exports, as in recent years, then a trade deficit exists. (Source: http://bea.gov/iTable/index_nipa.cfm)</a></p>
<p>Consumption expenditure by households is the largest component of
GDP, accounting for about two-thirds of the GDP in any year. This
tells us that consumers’ spending decisions are a major driver of
the economy. However, consumer spending is a gentle elephant: when
viewed over time, it does not jump around too much, and has
increased modestly from about 60% of GDP in the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark440">Investment expenditure refers to purchases of
physical plant and equipment, primarily by businesses. If Starbucks
builds a new store, or Amazon buys robots, they count these
expenditures under business investment. Investment demand is far
smaller than consumption demand, typically accounting for only about
15–18% of GDP, but it is very important for the economy because this
is where jobs are created. However, it fluctuates more noticeably
than consumption. Business investment is volatile. New technology or
a new product can spur business investment, but then confidence can
drop and business investment can pull back sharply.</span><span

<p><span id="bookmark443">How do statisticians measure GDP?</span></p>
<p>Government economists at the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA),
within the U.S. Department of Commerce, piece together estimates of
GDP from a variety of sources.</p>
<p>Once every five years, in the second and seventh year of each
decade, the Bureau of the Census carries</p>
<p>If you have noticed any of the infrastructure projects (new bridges,
highways, airports) launched during the 2009 recession, you have
seen how important government spending can be for the economy.
Government expenditure in the United States is close to 20% of GDP,
and includes spending by all three levels of government: federal,
state, and local. The only part of government spending counted in
demand is government purchases of goods or services produced in the
economy. Examples include the government buying a new fighter jet
for the Air Force (federal government spending), building a new
highway (state government spending), or a new school (local
government spending). A significant portion of government budgets
consists of transfer payments, like unemployment benefits, veteran’s
benefits, and Social Security payments to retirees. The government
excludes these payments from GDP because it does not receive a new
good or service in return or exchange. Instead they are transfers of
income from taxpayers to others. If you are curious about the
awesome undertaking of adding up GDP, read the following Clear It Up
feature.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_144.png" width="624" height="495" alt="image" />
<p>out a detailed census of businesses throughout the United States. In
between, the Census Bureau carries out a monthly survey of retail
sales. The government adjusts these figures with foreign trade data
to account for exports that are produced in the United States and
sold abroad and for imports that are produced abroad and sold here.
Once every ten years, the Census Bureau conducts a comprehensive
survey of housing and residential finance. Together, these sources
provide the main basis for figuring out what is produced for
consumers.</p>
<p>For investment, the Census Bureau carries out a monthly survey of
construction and an annual survey of expenditures on physical
capital equipment.</p>
<p>For what the federal government purchases, the statisticians rely on
the U.S. Department of the Treasury. An annual Census of Governments
gathers information on state and local governments. Because the
government spends a considerable amount at all levels hiring people
to provide services, it also tracks a large portion of spending
through payroll records that state governments and the Social
Security Administration collect.</p>
<p>With regard to foreign trade, the Census Bureau compiles a monthly
record of all import and export documents. Additional surveys cover
transportation and travel, and make adjustments for financial
services that are produced in the United States for foreign
customers.</p>
<p>Many other sources contribute to GDP estimates. Information on
energy comes from the U.S. Department of Transportation and
Department of Energy. The Agency for Health Care Research and
Quality collects information on healthcare. Surveys of landlords
find out about rental income. The Department of Agriculture collects
statistics on farming.</p>
<p>All these bits and pieces of information arrive in different forms,
at different time intervals. The BEA melds them together to produce
GDP estimates on a quarterly basis (every three months). The BEA
then “annualizes” these numbers by multiplying by four. As more
information comes in, the BEA updates and revises these estimates.
BEA releases the GDP “advance” estimate for a certain quarter one
month after a quarter. The “preliminary” estimate comes out one
month after that. The BEA publishes the “final” estimate one month
later, but it is not actually final. In July, the BEA releases
roughly updated estimates for the previous calendar year. Then, once
every five years, after it has processed all the results of the
latest detailed five-year business census, the BEA revises all of
the past GDP estimates according to the newest methods and data,
going all the way back to 1929.</p>

<p><span id="bookmark444">When thinking about the demand for
domestically produced goods in a global economy, it is important to
count spending on exports—domestically produced goods that a country
sells abroad. Similarly, we must also subtract spending on
imports—goods that a country produces in other countries that
residents of this country purchase. The GDP net export component is
equal to the dollar value of exports (X) minus the dollar value of
imports (M), (X – M). We call the gap between exports and imports
the</span> <strong>trade balance</strong>. If a country’s exports are larger than
its imports, then a country has a <strong>trade
surplus</strong><a href="#bookmark439" class="s34">. In the United States, exports typically exceeded imports in the 1960s and 1970s, as</a>
<a href="#bookmark439" class="a">Figure</a> <span
class="s54">6.4</span>(b) shows.<span id="bookmark445">‌</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark446">Since the early 1980s, imports have typically
exceeded exports, and so the United States has experienced a</span>
<strong>trade</strong></p>
<p><span id="bookmark447">deficit</span>
<a href="#bookmark439" class="s34">in most years. The trade deficit grew quite large in the late 1990s and in the mid-2000s.</a>

</span><span class="p">(b) also shows that imports and exports have
both risen substantially in recent decades, even after the declines
during the Great Recession between 2008 and 2009. As we noted
before, if exports and imports are equal, foreign trade has no
effect on total GDP. However, even if exports and imports are
balanced overall, foreign trade might still have powerful effects on
particular industries and workers by causing nations to shift
workers and physical capital investment toward one industry rather
than another.</span></p>
<p>Based on these four components of demand, we can measure GDP as:</p>
<p>GDP = Consumption + Investment + Government + Trade balance GDP =
C + I + G + (X – M)</p>
<p>Understanding how to measure GDP is important for analyzing
connections in the macro economy and for thinking about
macroeconomic policy tools.</p>

<p><span id="bookmark451">Figure 6.6 Types of Production</span> <span
class="s37">Services are the largest single component of total
supply, representing over 60 percent of GDP, up from about 45 perent
in the early 1960s. Durable and nondurable goods constitute the
manufacturing sector, and they have declined from 45 percent of GDP
in 1960 to about 30 percent in 2016.</span></p>
<p>Nondurable goods used to be larger than durable goods, but in recent
years, nondurable goods have been dropping to below the share of
durable goods, which is less than 20% of GDP. Structures hover
around 10% of GDP. We do not show here the change in inventories,
the final component of aggregate supply. It is typically less than
1% of GDP.</p>
<p>In thinking about what is produced in the economy, many
non-economists immediately focus on solid, long-lasting goods, like
cars and computers. By far the largest part of GDP, however, is
services. Moreover, services have been a growing share of GDP over
time. A detailed breakdown of the leading service industries would
include healthcare, education, and legal and financial services. It
has been decades since most of the U.S. economy involved making
solid objects. Instead, the most common jobs in a modern economy
involve a worker looking at pieces of paper or a computer screen;
meeting with co-workers, customers, or suppliers; or making phone
calls.</p>
<p>Even within the overall category of goods, long-lasting durable
goods like cars and refrigerators are about the same share of the
economy as short-lived nondurable goods like food and clothing. The
category of structures includes everything from homes, to office
buildings, shopping malls, and factories. Inventories is a small
category that refers to the goods that one business has produced but
has not yet sold to consumers, and are still sitting in warehouses
and on shelves. The amount of inventories sitting on shelves tends
to decline if business is better than expected, or to rise if
business is worse than expected.</p>
<p>Another Way to Measure GDP: The National Income Approach</p>
<p><span id="bookmark452">GDP is a measure of what is produced in a
nation. The primary way GDP is estimated is with the Expenditure
Approach we discussed above, but there is another way. Everything a
firm produces, when sold, becomes revenues to the firm. Businesses
use revenues to pay their bills: Wages and salaries for labor,
interest and dividends for capital, rent for land, profit to the
entrepreneur, etc. So adding up all the income produced in a year
provides a second way of measuring GDP. This is why the terms GDP
and</span> <strong>national income</strong> are sometimes used interchangeably.
The total</p>
<p>value of a nation’s output is equal to the total value of a nation’s
income.</p>
<p>The Problem of Double Counting</p>
<p><span id="bookmark453">We define GDP as the current value of all
final goods and services produced in a nation in a year. What are
final goods? They are goods at the furthest stage of production at
the end of a year. Statisticians who calculate GDP must avoid the
mistake of</span> <strong>double counting</strong>, in which they count output
more than once as it travels through the production stages. For
example, imagine what would happen if government statisticians first
counted the value of tires that a tire manufacturer produces, and
then counted the value of a new truck that an automaker sold that
contains those tires. In this example, the statisticians would have
counted the value of the tires twice-because the truck’s price
includes the value of the tires.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark454">To avoid this problem, which would overstate
the size of the economy considerably, government statisticians count
just the value of</span> <strong>final goods and services</strong> in the chain
of production that are sold for consumption, investment, government,
and trade purposes. Statisticians exclude intermediate
<strong>intermediate goods</strong>, which are goods that go into producing other
goods, from GDP calculations. From the example above, they will only
count the Ford truck’s value. The value of what businesses provide
to other businesses is captured in the final products at the end of
the production chain.<span id="bookmark455">‌</span></p>
<p>The concept of GDP is fairly straightforward: it is just the dollar
value of all final goods and services produced in the economy in a
year. In our decentralized, market-oriented economy, actually
calculating the more than $18 trillion- dollar U.S. GDP—along with
how it is changing every few months—is a full-time job for a brigade
of government statisticians.</p>

<a href="#bookmark456" class="a">Table 6.3</a> <span
class="p">outlines. The sales of used goods are not included because
they were produced in a previous year and are part of that year’s
GDP. The entire underground economy of services paid “under the
table” and illegal sales should be counted, but is not, because it
is impossible to track these sales. In Friedrich Schneider’s recent
study of shadow economies, he estimated the underground economy in
the United States to be 6.6% of GDP, or close to $2 trillion dollars
in 2013 alone. Transfer payments, such as payment by the government
to individuals, are not included, because they do not represent
production. Also, production of some goods—such as home production
as when you make your breakfast—is not counted because these goods
are not sold in the marketplace.</span></p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_149.png" width="624" height="160" alt="image" />
<p>Other Ways to Measure the Economy</p>
<p>Besides GDP, there are several different but closely related ways of
measuring the size of the economy. We mentioned above that we can
think of GDP as total production and as total purchases. We can also
think of it as total income since anything one produces and sells
yields income.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark457">One of the closest cousins of GDP is
the</span> <strong>gross national product (GNP)</strong>. GDP includes only what
country produces within its borders. GNP adds what domestic
businesses and labor abroad produces, and subtracts any payments
that foreign labor and businesses located in the United States send
home to other countries. In other words, GNP is based more on what a
country’s citizens and firms produce, wherever they are located, and
GDP is based on what happens within a certain county’s geographic
boundaries. For the United States, the gap between GDP and GNP is
relatively small; in recent years, only about 0.2%. For small
nations, which may have a substantial share of their population
working abroad and sending money back home, the difference can be
substantial.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark458">We calculate</span> <strong>net national product
(NNP)</strong> by taking GNP and then subtracting the value of how much
physical capital is worn out, or reduced in value because of aging,
over the course of a year. The process by which capital ages and
loses value is called <strong>depreciation</strong>. We can further subdivide NNP
into <strong>national income</strong>, which includes all income to businesses
and individuals, and personal income, which includes only income to
people.<span id="bookmark459">‌</span></p>

<p>For practical purposes, it is not vital to memorize these
definitions. However, it is important to be aware that these
differences exist and to know what statistic you are examining, so
that you do not accidentally compare, say, GDP in one year or for
one country with GNP or NNP in another year or another country. To

<p><span id="bookmark462">When examining economic statistics, there is
a crucial distinction worth emphasizing. The distinction is between
nominal and real measurements, which refer to whether or not
inflation has distorted a given statistic. Looking at economic
statistics without considering inflation is like looking through a
pair of binoculars and trying to guess how close something is:
unless you know how strong the lenses are, you cannot guess the
distance very accurately. Similarly, if you do not know the
inflation rate, it is difficult to figure out if a rise in GDP is
due mainly to a rise in the overall level of prices or to a rise in
quantities of goods produced. The</span> <strong>nominal value</strong> of any
economic statistic means that we measure the statistic in terms of
actual prices that exist at the time. The <strong>real value</strong> refers to
the same statistic after it has been adjusted for inflation.
Generally, it is the real value that is more important.<span

<span class="s37">Nominal GDP values have risen exponentially from
1960 through 2010, according to the BEA.</span></p>
<p>If an unwary analyst compared nominal GDP in 1960 to nominal GDP in
2010, it might appear that national output had risen by a factor of
more than twenty-seven over this time (that is, GDP of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(14,958
billion in 2010 divided by GDP of \)</span>543 billion in 1960 = 27.5). This
conclusion would be highly misleading. Recall that we define nominal
GDP as the quantity of every good or service produced multiplied by
the price at which it was sold, summed up for all goods and
services. In order to see how much production has actually
increased, we need to extract the effects of higher prices on
nominal GDP. We can easily accomplish this using the GDP deflator.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark690" id="bookmark466" class="s34">The GDP deflator is a price index measuring the average prices of all goods and services included in the economy. We explore price indices in detail and how we compute them in</a>

<p><span id="bookmark467">Figure 6.8 U.S. GDP Deflator,
1960–2010</span> <span class="s37">Much like nominal GDP, the GDP
deflator has risen exponentially from 1960 through 2010. (Source:
BEA)</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark467" class="a">Figure 6.8</a> <span
class="p">shows that the price level has risen dramatically
since 1960. The price level in 2010 was almost six times higher than
in 1960 (the deflator for 2010 was 110 versus a level of 19 in
1960). Clearly, much of the growth in nominal GDP was due to
inflation, not an actual change in the quantity of goods and
services produced, in other words, not in real GDP. Recall that
nominal GDP can rise for two reasons: an increase in output, and/or
an increase in prices. What is needed is to extract the increase in
prices from nominal GDP so as to measure only changes in output.
After all, the dollars used to measure nominal GDP in 1960 are worth
more than the inflated dollars of 1990—and the price index tells
exactly how much more. This adjustment is easy to do if you
understand that nominal measurements are in value terms,
where</span></p>
<p>Value = Price × Quantity</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>Nominal GDP = GDP Deflator × Real GDP</p>
<p>Let’s look at an example at the micro level. Suppose the t-shirt
company, Coolshirts, sells 10 t-shirts at a price of $9 each.</p>
<p>Then,</p>
<p>Coolshirt’s nominal revenue from sales = Price × Quantity</p>
<p>= $9 × 10</p>
<p>= $90</p>
<p>Price</p>
<p>Coolshirt’s real income = <u>Nominal revenue</u></p>
<p>=</p>
<p>$90</p>
<p>$9</p>
<p>= 10</p>
<p>In other words, when we compute “real” measurements we are trying to
obtain actual quantities, in this case, 10 t- shirts.</p>
<p>With GDP, it is just a tiny bit more complicated. We start with the
same formula as above:</p>
<p>Real GDP =</p>
<p>Nominal GDP<span class="s16"> Price Index</span></p>
<p>For reasons that we will explain in more detail below,
mathematically, a price index is a two-digit decimal number like</p>
<p>1.00 or 0.85 or 1.25. Because some people have trouble working with
decimals, when the price index is published, it has traditionally
been multiplied by 100 to get integer numbers like 100, 85, or 125.
What this means is that when we “deflate” nominal figures to get
real figures (by dividing the nominal by the price index). We also
need to remember to divide the published price index by 100 to make
the math work. Thus, the formula becomes:</p>
<p>Real GDP =</p>
<p>Nominal GDP<span class="s16"> Price Index / 100</span></p>
<p>Now read the following Work It Out feature for more practice
calculating real GDP.</p>
<p>Computing GDP</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark464" class="s84">It is possible to use the data in</a>
<a href="#bookmark464" class="s43">Table</a> 6.5 <span
class="s37">to compute real GDP.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark464" class="s84">Step 1. Look at</a>
<a href="#bookmark464" class="s43">Table</a> 6.5<span class="s37">,
to see that, in 1960, nominal GDP was $543.3 billion and the price
index (GDP deflator) was 19.0.</span></p>
<p>Step 2. To calculate the real GDP in 1960, use the formula:</p>
<p>Real GDP =</p>
<p>Nominal GDP<span class="s16"> Price Index / 100</span></p>
<p>=</p>
<p>$543.3 billion<span class="s16"> 19 / 100</span></p>
<p>= $2,859.5 billion</p>
<p>We’ll do this in two parts to make it clear. First adjust the price
index: 19 divided by 100 = 0.19. Then divide into nominal GDP:
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(543.3 billion / 0.19 = \)</span>2,859.5 billion.</p>
<p>Step 3. Use the same formula to calculate the real GDP in 1965.</p>
<p>Real GDP =</p>
<p>Nominal GDP<span class="s16"> Price Index / 100</span></p>
<p>=</p>
<p>$743.7 billion<span class="s16"> 20.3 / 100</span></p>
<p>= $3,663.5 billion</p>

<p>Table 6.6 Converting Nominal to Real GDP <span class="s47">(Source:
Bureau of Economic Analysis, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bea.gov">www.bea.gov</a>)</span></p>
<p>There are a couple things to notice here. Whenever you compute a
real statistic, one year (or period) plays a special role. It is
called the base year (or base period). The base year is the year
whose prices we use to compute the real statistic. When we calculate
real GDP, for example, we take the quantities of goods and services
produced in each year (for example, 1960 or 1973) and multiply them
by their prices in the base year (in this case, 2005), so we get a
measure of GDP that uses prices that do not change from year to
year. That is why real GDP is labeled “Constant Dollars” or, in this
example, “2005 Dollars,” which means that real GDP is constructed
using prices that existed in 2005. While the example here uses 2005
as the base year, more generally, you can use any year as the base
year. The formula is:</p>
<p>Real GDP</p>
<p>GDP deflator = <u>Nominal GDP</u><span class="s86"> </span>× 100</p>
<p>Rearranging the formula and using the data from 2005:</p>
<p>Real GDP =</p>
<p>Nominal GDP<span class="s16"> Price Index / 100</span></p>
<p>=</p>
<p>$13,095.4 billion<span class="s16"> 100 / 100</span></p>
<p>= $13,095.4 billion</p>
<p>Comparing real GDP and nominal GDP for 2005, you see they are the
same. This is no accident. It is because we have chosen 2005 as the
“base year” in this example. Since the price index in the base year
always has a value of 100 (by definition), nominal and real GDP are
always the same in the base year.</p>
<p>Look at the data for 2010.</p>
<p>Real GDP =</p>
<p>Nominal GDP<span class="s16"> Price Index / 100</span></p>
<p>=</p>
<p>$14,958.3 billion<span class="s16"> 110 / 100</span></p>
<p>= $13,598.5 billion</p>
<p>Use this data to make another observation: As long as inflation is
positive, meaning prices increase on average from year to year, real
GDP should be less than nominal GDP in any year after the base year.
The reason for this should be clear: The value of nominal GDP is
“inflated” by inflation. Similarly, as long as inflation is
positive, real GDP should be greater than nominal GDP in any year
before the base year.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark471" id="bookmark469" class="a">Figure 6.9</a>
<span class="p">shows the U.S. nominal and real GDP since 1960.
Because 2005 is the base year, the nominal and real values are
exactly the same in that year. However, over time, the rise in
nominal GDP looks much larger than the rise in real GDP (that is,
the nominal GDP line rises more steeply than the real GDP line),
because the presence of</span><span id="bookmark470">‌</span></p>
<p>inflation, especially in the 1970s exaggerates the rise in nominal
GDP.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_156.jpg" width="384" height="269" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark471">Figure 6.9 U.S. Nominal and Real GDP,
1960–2012</span> <span class="s37">The red line measures U.S. GDP in
nominal dollars. The black line measures U.S. GDP in real dollars,
where all dollar values are converted to 2005 dollars. Since we
express real GDP in 2005 dollars, the two lines cross in 2005.
However, real GDP will appear higher than nominal GDP in the years
before 2005, because dollars were worth less in 2005 than in
previous years. Conversely, real GDP will appear lower in the years
after 2005, because dollars were worth more in 2005 than in later
years.</span></p>
<p>Let’s return to the question that we posed originally: How much did
GDP increase in real terms? What was the real GDP growth rate from
1960 to 2010? To find the real growth rate, we apply the formula for
percentage change:</p>
<p>2,859.5</p>
<p>1960 real GDP</p>
<p>2010 real GDP – 1960 real GDP<span class="s16"> </span><span
class="s87">× 100 = % change </span>13,598.5 – 2,859.5<span
class="s16"> </span><span class="s81">× 100 = 376%</span></p>
<p>In other words, the U.S. economy has increased real production of
goods and services by nearly a factor of four since 1960. Of course,
that understates the material improvement since it fails to capture
improvements in the quality of products and the invention of new
products.</p>
<p>There is a quicker way to answer this question approximately, using
another math trick. Because:</p>
<p>Nominal = Price × Quantity</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>Therefore, real GDP growth rate (% change in quantity) equals the
growth rate in nominal GDP (% change in value) minus the inflation
rate (% change in price).</p>
<p>Note that using this equation provides an approximation for small
changes in the levels. For more accurate measures, one should use
the first formula.</p>

</ul>
<p>When news reports indicate that “the economy grew 1.2% in the first
quarter,” the reports are referring to the percentage change in real
GDP. By convention, governments report GDP growth is at an
annualized rate: Whatever the calculated growth in real GDP was for
the quarter, we multiply it by four when it is reported as if the
economy were growing at that rate for a full year.</p>

class="s37">Real GDP in the United States in 2016 (in 2009 dollars)
was about $16.7 trillion. After adjusting to remove the effects of

economy’s production of goods and services since the start of the
twentieth century. (Source: <a class="reference external" href="http://bea.gov">bea.gov</a>)</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark473" id="bookmark474" class="a">Figure 6.10</a><span
class="s54"> </span>shows the pattern of U.S. real GDP since 1900.
Short term declines have regularly interrupted the generally upward
long-term path of GDP. We call a significant decline in real GDP a
<strong>recession</strong>. We call an especially lengthy and deep recession a
<strong>depression</strong>. The severe drop in GDP that occurred during the
1930s Great Depression is clearly visible in the figure, as is the
2008–2009 Great Recession.<span id="bookmark475">‌</span><span
id="bookmark476">‌</span></p>
<p>Real GDP is important because it is highly correlated with other
measures of economic activity, like employment and unemployment.
When real GDP rises, so does employment.</p>
<p>The most significant human problem associated with recessions (and
their larger, uglier cousins, depressions) is that a slowdown in
production means that firms need to lay off or fire some of their
workers. Losing a job imposes painful financial and personal costs
on workers, and often on their extended families as well. In
addition, even those who keep their jobs are likely to find that
wage raises are scanty at best—or their employers may ask them to
take pay cuts.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark480" id="bookmark477" class="a">Table 6.7</a><span
class="s54"> </span>lists the pattern of recessions and expansions
in the U.S. economy since 1900. We call the highest point of the
economy, before the recession begins, the <strong>peak</strong>. Conversely, the
lowest point of a recession, before a recovery begins, is the
<strong>trough</strong>. Thus, a recession lasts from peak to trough, and an
economic upswing runs from trough to peak. We call the economy’s
movement from peak to trough and trough to peak the <strong>business
cycle</strong>. It is intriguing to notice that the three longest
trough-to-peak expansions of the twentieth century have happened
since 1960. The most recent recession started in December 2007 and
ended formally in June 2009. This was the most severe recession
since the 1930s Great Depression. The ongoing expansion since the
June 2009 trough will also be quite long, comparatively, having
already reached 90 months at the end of 2016.<span

<p><span id="bookmark481">A private think tank, the National Bureau of

<li><p>Explain how we can use GDP to compare the economic welfare of
different nations</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate the conversion of GDP to a common currency by using

<li><p>Calculate GDP per capita using population data</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is common to use GDP as a measure of economic welfare or standard
of living in a nation. When comparing the GDP of different nations
for this purpose, two issues immediately arise. First, we measure a
country’s GDP in its own currency: the United States uses the U.S.
dollar; Canada, the Canadian dollar; most countries of Western
Europe, the euro; Japan, the yen; Mexico, the peso; and so on. Thus,
comparing GDP between two countries requires converting to a common
currency. A second issue is that countries have very different
numbers of people. For instance, the United States has a much larger
economy than Mexico or Canada, but it also has almost three times as
many people as Mexico and nine times as many people as Canada. Thus,
if we are trying to compare standards of living across countries, we
need to divide GDP by population.</p>
<p>Converting Currencies with Exchange Rates</p>
<p><span id="bookmark483">To compare the GDP of countries with
different currencies, it is necessary to convert to a “common
denominator” using an</span> <strong>exchange rate</strong>, which is the value
of one currency in terms of another currency. We express exchange
rates either as the units of country A’s currency that need to be
traded for a single unit of country B’s currency (for example,
Japanese yen per British pound), or as the inverse (for example,
British pounds per Japanese yen). We can use two types of exchange
rates for this purpose, market exchange rates and purchasing power
parity (PPP)<span id="bookmark484">‌</span></p>

<p><a href="#bookmark690" class="s34">equivalent exchange rates. Market exchange rates vary on a day-to-day basis depending on supply and demand in foreign exchange markets. PPP-equivalent exchange rates provide a longer run measure of the exchange rate. For this reason, economists typically use PPP-equivalent exchange rates for GDP cross country comparisons. We will discuss exchange rates in more detail in</a>
<a href="#bookmark690" class="a">Exchange Rates and International Capital</a>
Flows<span class="p">. The following Work It Out feature explains
how to convert GDP to a common currency.</span></p>
<p>Converting GDP to a Common Currency</p>
<p>Using the exchange rate to convert GDP from one currency to another
is straightforward. Say that the task is to compare Brazil’s GDP in
2013 of 4.8 trillion reals with the U.S. GDP of $16.6 trillion for
the same year.</p>
<p>Step 1. Determine the exchange rate for the specified year. In 2013,
the exchange rate was 2.230 reals = $1. (These numbers are
realistic, but rounded off to simplify the calculations.)</p>
<p>Step 2. Convert Brazil’s GDP into U.S. dollars:</p>
<p>Brazil’s GDP in $ U.S. =</p>
<p>Brazil’s GDP in reals     <span class="s16"> Exchange rate
(reals/$ U.S.)</span></p>
<p>=</p>
<p>4.8 trillion reals</p>
<p>2.230 reals per $ U.S.</p>
<p>= $2.2 trillion</p>
<p>Step 3. Compare this value to the GDP in the United States in the
same year. The U.S. GDP was $16.6 trillion in 2013, which is nearly
eight times that of GDP in Brazil in 2012.</p>

<p>GDP Per Capita</p>
<p>The U.S. economy has the largest GDP in the world, by a considerable
amount. The United States is also a populous country; in fact, it is
the third largest country by population in the world, although well
behind China and India. Is the</p>
<p><span id="bookmark486">U.S. economy larger than other countries just
because the United States has more people than most other countries,
or because the U.S. economy is actually larger on a per-person
basis? We can answer this question by calculating a country’s</span>
<strong>GDP per capita</strong>; that is, the GDP divided by the population.</p>
<p>GDP per capita = GDP/population</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark487" class="s34">The second column of</a>
<a href="#bookmark487" class="a">Table 6.9</a>

the population for each country. The fourth column lists the GDP per
capita. We obtain GDP per capita in two steps: First, by multiplying
column two (GDP, in billions of dollars) by 1000 so it has the same
units as column three (Population, in millions). Then divide the
result (GDP in millions of dollars) by column three (Population, in
millions).</span></p>

<p>Notice that the ranking by GDP is different from the ranking by GDP
per capita. India has a somewhat larger GDP than Germany, but on a
per capita basis, Germany has more than 10 times India’s standard of
living. Will China soon have a better standard of living than the
U.S.? Read the following Clear It Up feature to find out.</p>
<p>Is China going to surpass the United States in terms of standard of
living?</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark487" class="s84">As</a> Table 6.9 <span
class="s37">shows, China has the second largest GDP of the
countries: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(9.5 trillion compared to the United States’ \)</span>16.8
trillion. Perhaps it will surpass the United States, but probably
not any time soon. China has a much larger population so that in per
capita terms, its GDP is less than one fifth that of the United
States (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(6,958.48 compared to \)</span>53,013). The Chinese people are still
quite poor relative to the United States and other developed
countries. One caveat: For reasons we will discuss shortly, GDP per
capita can give us only a rough idea of the differences in living
standards across countries.</span></p>
<p>The world’s high-income nations—including the United States, Canada,
the Western European countries, and Japan—typically have GDP per
capita in the range of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(20,000 to \)</span>50,000. Middle-income countries,
which include much of Latin America, Eastern Europe, and some
countries in East Asia, have GDP per capita in the range of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(6,000
to \)</span>12,000. The world’s low-income countries, many of them located
in Africa and Asia, often have GDP per capita of less than $2,000
per year.</p>

Well GDP Measures the Well-Being of Society</span><span
id="bookmark488">‌</span></p>
<p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Discuss how productivity influences the standard of living</p></li>
<li><p>Explain the limitations of GDP as a measure of the standard of
living</p></li>
<li><p>Analyze the relationship between GDP data and fluctuations in
the standard of living</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The level of GDP per capita clearly captures some of what we mean by
the phrase “standard of living.” Most of the migration in the world,
for example, involves people who are moving from countries with
relatively low GDP per capita to countries with relatively high GDP
per capita.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark489">“Standard of living” is a broader term than
GDP. While GDP focuses on production that is bought and sold in
markets,</span> <strong>standard of living</strong> includes all elements that
affect people’s well-being, whether they are bought and sold in the
market or not. To illuminate the difference between GDP and standard
of living, it is useful to spell out some things that GDP does not
cover that are clearly relevant to standard of living.</p>
<p>Limitations of GDP as a Measure of the Standard of Living</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark487" class="s34">While GDP includes spending on recreation and travel, it does not cover leisure time. Clearly, however, there is a substantial difference between an economy that is large because people work long hours, and an economy that is just as large because people are more productive with their time so they do not have to work as many hours. The GDP per capita of the U.S. economy is larger than the GDP per capita of Germany, as</a>
<a href="#bookmark487" class="a">Table 6.9</a> <span
class="p">showed, but does that prove that the standard of living in
the United States is higher? Not necessarily, since it is also true
that the average U.S. worker works several hundred hours more per
year more than the average German worker. Calculating GDP does not
account for the German worker’s extra vacation weeks.</span></p>
<p>While GDP includes what a country spends on environmental
protection, healthcare, and education, it does not include actual
levels of environmental cleanliness, health, and learning. GDP
includes the cost of buying pollution- control equipment, but it
does not address whether the air and water are actually cleaner or
dirtier. GDP includes spending on medical care, but does not address
whether life expectancy or infant mortality have risen or fallen.
Similarly, it counts spending on education, but does not address
directly how much of the population can read, write,</p>
<p>or do basic mathematics.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark490">GDP includes production that is exchanged in
the market, but it does not cover production that is not exchanged
in the market. For example, hiring someone to mow your lawn or clean
your house is part of GDP, but doing these tasks yourself is not
part of GDP. One remarkable change in the U.S. economy in recent
decades is the growth in women’s participation in the labor force.
As of 1970, only about 42% of women participated in the paid labor
force. By the second decade of the 2000s, nearly 60% of women
participated in the paid labor force according to the Bureau of
Labor Statistics. As women are now in the labor force, many of the
services they used to produce in the non-market economy like food
preparation and child care have shifted to some extent into the
market economy, which makes the GDP appear larger even if people
actually are not consuming more services.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark491">GDP has nothing to say about the level of
inequality in society. GDP per capita is only an average. When GDP
per capita rises by 5%, it could mean that GDP for everyone in the
society has risen by 5%, or that GDP of some groups has risen by
more while that of others has risen by less—or even declined. GDP
also has nothing in particular to say about the amount of variety
available. If a family buys 100 loaves of bread in a year, GDP does
not care whether they are all white bread, or whether the family can
choose from wheat, rye, pumpernickel, and many others—it just looks
at the total amount the family spends on bread.</span></p>
<p>Likewise, GDP has nothing much to say about what technology and
products are available. The standard of living in, for example, 1950
or 1900 was not affected only by how much money people had—it was
also affected by what they could buy. No matter how much money you
had in 1950, you could not buy an iPhone or a personal computer.</p>
<p>In certain cases, it is not clear that a rise in GDP is even a good
thing. If a city is wrecked by a hurricane, and then experiences a
surge of rebuilding construction activity, it would be peculiar to
claim that the hurricane was therefore economically beneficial. If
people are led by a rising fear of crime, to pay for installing bars
and burglar alarms on all their windows, it is hard to believe that
this increase in GDP has made them better off. Similarly, some
people would argue that sales of certain goods, like pornography or
extremely violent movies, do not represent a gain to society’s
standard of living.</p>
<p>Does a Rise in GDP Overstate or Understate the Rise in the Standard
of Living?</p>
<p>The fact that GDP per capita does not fully capture the broader idea
of standard of living has led to a concern that the increases in GDP
over time are illusory. It is theoretically possible that while GDP
is rising, the standard of living could be falling if human health,
environmental cleanliness, and other factors that are not included
in GDP are worsening. Fortunately, this fear appears to be
overstated.</p>
<p>In some ways, the rise in GDP understates the actual rise in the
standard of living. For example, the typical workweek for a U.S.
worker has fallen over the last century from about 60 hours per week
to less than 40 hours per week. Life expectancy and health have
risen dramatically, and so has the average level of education. Since
1970, the air and water in the United States have generally been
getting cleaner. Companies have developed new technologies for
entertainment, travel, information, and health. A much wider variety
of basic products like food and clothing is available today than
several decades ago. Because GDP does not capture leisure, health, a
cleaner environment, the possibilities that new technology creates,
or an increase in variety, the actual rise in the standard of living
for Americans in recent decades has exceeded the rise in GDP.</p>

<p>On the other side, crime rates, traffic congestion levels, and
income inequality are higher in the United States now than they were
in the 1960s. Moreover, a substantial number of services that women
primarily provided in the non- market economy are now part of the
market economy that GDP counts. By ignoring these factors, GDP would
tend to overstate the true rise in the standard of living.</p>

<p>GDP is Rough, but Useful</p>
<p>A high level of GDP should not be the only goal of macroeconomic
policy, or government policy more broadly. Even though GDP does not
measure the broader standard of living with any precision, it does
measure production well and it does indicate when a country is
materially better or worse off in terms of jobs and incomes. In most
countries, a significantly higher GDP per capita occurs hand in hand
with other improvements in everyday life along many dimensions, like
education, health, and environmental protection.</p>

<p>How is the Economy Doing? How Does One Tell?</p>
<p>To determine the state of the economy, one needs to examine economic
indicators, such as GDP. To calculate GDP is quite an undertaking.
It is the broadest measure of a nation’s economic activity and we
owe a debt to Simon Kuznets, the creator of the measurement, for
that.</p>
<p>The sheer size of the U.S. economy as measured by GDP is huge—as of
the fourth quarter of 2016, $18.9 trillion worth of goods and
services were produced annually. Real GDP informed us that the
2008–2009 recession was severe and that the recovery from that
recession has been slow, but the economy is improving. GDP per
capita gives a rough estimate of a nation’s standard of living. This
chapter is the building block for other chapters that explore more
economic indicators such as unemployment, inflation, or interest
rates, and perhaps more importantly, will explain how they are
related and what causes them to rise or fall.</p>
<p>No single number can capture all the elements of a term as broad as
“standard of living.” Nonetheless, GDP per capita is a reasonable,
rough-and-ready measure of the standard of living.</p>

<p>KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY</p>
<ol>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark435" class="a">Measuring the Size of the Economy: Gross Domestic</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark435">Product</a></p>
<p>Economists generally express the size of a nation’s economy as
its gross domestic product (GDP), which measures the value of
the output of all goods and services produced within the country
in a year. Economists measure GDP by taking the quantities of
all goods and services produced, multiplying them by their
prices, and summing the total. Since GDP measures what is bought
and sold in the economy, we can measure it either by the sum of
what is purchased in the economy or what is produced.</p>
<p>We can divide demand into consumption, investment, government,
exports, and imports. We can divide what is produced in the
economy into durable goods, nondurable goods, services,
structures, and inventories. To avoid double counting, GDP
counts only final output of goods and services, not the
production of intermediate goods or the value of labor in the
chain of production.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark461" class="a">Adjusting Nominal Values to Real</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark461">Values</a></p>
<p>The nominal value of an economic statistic is the commonly
announced value. The real value is the value after adjusting for
changes in inflation. To convert nominal economic data from
several different years into real, inflation- adjusted data, the
starting point is to choose a base year arbitrarily and then use
a price index to convert the measurements so that economists
measure them in the money prevailing in the base year.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark472" class="a">Tracking Real GDP over</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark472">Time</a></p>
<p>Over the long term, U.S. real GDP have increased dramatically.
At the same time, GDP has not increased the same amount each
year. The speeding up and slowing down of GDP growth represents
the business cycle. When GDP declines significantly, a recession
occurs. A longer and deeper decline is a depression. Recessions
begin at the business cycle’s peak and end at the trough.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark482" class="a">Comparing GDP among</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark482">Countries</a></p>
<p>Since we measure GDP in a country’s currency, in order to
compare different countries’ GDPs, we need to convert them to a
common currency. One way to do that is with the exchange rate,
which is the price of one country’s currency in terms of
another. Once we express GDPs in a common currency, we can
compare each country’s GDP per capita by dividing GDP by
population. Countries with large populations often have large
GDPs, but GDP alone can be a misleading indicator of a nation’s
wealth. A better measure is GDP per capita.</p>

</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>GDP is an indicator of a society’s standard of living, but it is only a
rough indicator. GDP does not directly take account of leisure,
environmental quality, levels of health and education, activities
conducted outside the market, changes in inequality of income, increases
in variety, increases in technology, or the (positive or negative) value
that society may place on certain types of output.</p>

<p>Calories and Economic Growth</p>
<p>On average, humans need about 2,500 calories a day to survive, depending
on height, weight, and gender. The economist Brad DeLong estimates that
the average worker in the early 1600s earned wages that could afford him
2,500 food calories. This worker lived in Western Europe. Two hundred
years later, that same worker could afford 3,000 food calories. However,
between 1800 and 1875, just a time span of just 75 years, economic
growth was so rapid that western European workers could purchase 5,000
food calories a day. By 2012, a low skilled worker in an affluent
Western European/North American country could afford to purchase</p>
<p>2.4 million food calories per day.</p>
<p>What caused such a rapid rise in living standards between 1800 and 1875
and thereafter? Why is it that many countries, especially those in
Western Europe, North America, and parts of East Asia, can feed their
populations more than adequately, while others cannot? We will look at
these and other questions as we examine long-run economic growth.</p>

<p>Every country worries about economic growth. In the United States and
other high-income countries, the question is whether economic growth
continues to provide the same remarkable gains in our standard of living
as it did during the twentieth century. Meanwhile, can middle-income
countries like Brazil, Egypt, or Poland catch up to the higher- income
countries, or must they remain in the second tier of per capita income?
Of the world’s population of roughly</p>
<p>7.5 billion people, about 1.1 billion are scraping by on incomes that
average less than $2 per day, not that different from the standard of
living 2,000 years ago. Can the world’s poor be lifted from their
fearful poverty? As the 1995 Nobel laureate in economics, Robert E.
Lucas Jr., once noted: “The consequences for human welfare involved in
questions like these are simply staggering: Once one starts to think
about them, it is hard to think about anything else.”</p>
<p>Dramatic improvements in a nation’s standard of living are possible.
After the Korean War in the late 1950s, the Republic of Korea, often
called South Korea, was one of the poorest economies in the world. Most
South Koreans worked in peasant agriculture. According to the British
economist Angus Maddison, who devoted life’s work to measuring GDP and
population in the world economy, GDP per capita in 1990 international
dollars was <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(854 per year. From the 1960s to the early twenty-first
century, a time period well within the lifetime and memory of many
adults, the South Korean economy grew rapidly. Over these four decades,
GDP per capita increased by more than 6% per year. According to the
World Bank, GDP for South Korea now exceeds \)</span>30,000 in nominal terms,
placing it firmly among high-income countries like Italy, New Zealand,
and Israel. Measured by total GDP in 2015, South Korea is the
eleventh-largest economy in the world. For a nation of 50 million
people, this transformation is extraordinary.</p>
<p>South Korea is a standout example, but it is not the only case of rapid
and sustained economic growth. Other East Asian nations, like Thailand
and Indonesia, have seen very rapid growth as well. China has grown
enormously since it enacted market-oriented economic reforms around
1980. GDP per capita in high-income economies like the United States
also has grown dramatically albeit over a longer time frame. Since the
Civil War, the U.S. economy has transformed from a primarily rural and
agricultural economy to an economy based on services, manufacturing, and
technology.</p>

<p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Explain the conditions that have allowed for modern economic
growth in the last two centuries</p></li>
<li><p>Analyze the influence of public policies on an economy’s
long-run economic growth</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span id="bookmark539">Let’s begin with a brief overview of
spectacular economic growth patterns around the world in the last
two centuries. We commonly refer to this as the period of</span>
<strong>modern economic growth</strong>. (Later in the chapter we will discuss
lower economic growth rates and some key ingredients for economic
progress.) Rapid and sustained economic growth is a relatively
recent experience for the human race. Before the last two centuries,
although rulers, nobles, and conquerors could afford some
extravagances and although economies rose above the subsistence
level, the average person’s standard of living had not changed much
for centuries.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark540">Progressive, powerful economic and
institutional changes started to have a significant effect in the
late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. According to the
Dutch economic historian Jan Luiten van Zanden, slavery-based
societies, favorable demographics, global trading routes, and
standardized trading institutions that spread with different empires
set the stage for the Industrial Revolution to succeed. The</span>
<strong>Industrial Revolution</strong> refers to the widespread use of
power-driven machinery and the economic and social changes that
resulted in the first half of the 1800s. Ingenious machines—the
steam engine, the power loom, and the steam locomotive—performed
tasks that otherwise would have taken vast numbers of workers to do.
The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain, and soon spread to
the United States, Germany, and other countries.<span
id="bookmark541">‌</span></p>
<p>The jobs for ordinary people working with these machines were often
dirty and dangerous by modern standards, but the alternative jobs of
that time in peasant agriculture and small-village industry were
often dirty and dangerous, too. The new jobs of the Industrial
Revolution typically offered higher pay and a chance for social
mobility. A self- reinforcing cycle began: New inventions and
investments generated profits, the profits provided funds for more
new investment and inventions, and the investments and inventions
provided opportunities for further profits. Slowly, a</p>

<p>group of national economies in Europe and North America emerged from
centuries of sluggishness into a period of rapid modern growth.
During the last two centuries, the average GDP growth rate per
capita in the leading industrialized countries has been about 2% per
year. What were times like before then? Read the following Clear It
Up feature for the answer.</p>
<p>What were economic conditions like before 1870?</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark542" class="s84">Angus Maddison, a quantitative economic historian, led the most systematic inquiry into national incomes before 1870. Economists recently have refined and used his methods to compile GDP per capita estimates from year 1 C.E. to 1348.</a>
<a href="#bookmark542" class="s43">Table 7.1</a> <span
class="s37">is an important counterpoint to most of the narrative in
this chapter. It shows that nations can decline as well as rise. A
wide array of forces, such as epidemics, natural and weather-
related disasters, the inability to govern large empires, and the
remarkably slow pace of technological and institutional progress
explain declines in income. Institutions are the traditions and laws
by which people in a community agree to behave and govern
themselves. Such institutions include marriage, religion, education,
and laws of governance. Institutional progress is the development
and codification of these institutions to reinforce social order,
and thus, economic growth.</span></p>
<p>One example of such an institution is the Magna Carta (Great
Charter), which the English nobles forced King John to sign in 1215.
The Magna Carta codified the principles of due process, whereby a
free man could not be penalized unless his peers had made a lawful
judgment against him. The United States in its own constitution
later adopted this concept. This social order may have contributed
to England’s GDP per capita in 1348, which was second to that of
northern Italy.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark542" class="s84">In studying economic growth, a country’s institutional framework plays a critical role.</a>
<a href="#bookmark542" class="s43">Table 7.1</a> <span
class="s37">also shows relative global equality for almost 1,300
years. After this, we begin to see significant divergence in income
(not in the table).</span></p>

from AD 1 to</p>

<p>Another fascinating and underreported fact is the high levels of
income, compared to others at that time, attained by the Islamic
Empire Abbasid Caliphate—which was founded in present-day Iraq in
730 C.E. At its height, the empire spanned large regions of the
Middle East, North Africa, and Spain until its gradual decline over
200 years.</p>
<p>The Industrial Revolution led to increasing inequality among
nations. Some economies took off, whereas others, like many of those
in Africa or Asia, remained close to a subsistence standard of
living. General calculations show that the 17 countries of the world
with the most-developed economies had, on average, 2.4 times the GDP
per capita of the world’s poorest economies in 1870. By 1960, the
most developed economies had 4.2 times the GDP per capita of the
poorest economies.</p>

Bank.</span></p>
<p>However, by the middle of the twentieth century, some countries had
shown that catching up was possible. Japan’s economic growth took
off in the 1960s and 1970s, with a growth rate of real GDP per
capita averaging 11% per year during those decades. Certain
countries in Latin America experienced a boom in economic growth in
the 1960s as well. In Brazil, for example, GDP per capita expanded
by an average annual rate of 11.1% from 1968 to 1973. In the 1970s,
some East Asian economies, including South Korea, Thailand, and
Taiwan, saw rapid growth. In these countries, growth rates of 11% to
12% per year in GDP per capita were not uncommon. More recently,
China, with its population of nearly 1.4 billion people, grew at a
per capita rate 9% per year from 1984 into the 2000s. India, with a
population of 1.3 billion, has shown promising signs of economic
growth, with growth in GDP per capita of about 4% per year during
the 1990s and climbing toward 7% to 8% per year in the 2000s.</p>
<p>These waves of catch-up economic growth have not reached all shores.
In certain African countries like Niger, Tanzania, and Sudan, for
example, GDP per capita at the start of the 2000s was still less
than $300, not much higher than it was in the nineteenth century and
for centuries before that. In the context of the overall situation
of low-income people around the world, the good economic news from
China (population: 1.4 billion) and India (population: 1.3 billion)
is, nonetheless, astounding and heartening.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark543">Economic growth in the last two centuries has
made a striking change in the human condition. Richard Easterlin, an
economist at the University of Southern California, wrote in
2000:</span></p>
<p>By many measures, a revolution in the human condition is sweeping
the world. Most people today are better fed, clothed, and housed
than their predecessors two centuries ago. They are healthier, live
longer, and are better educated. Women’s lives are less centered on
reproduction and political democracy has gained a foothold. Although
Western Europe and its offshoots have been the leaders of this
advance, most of the less developed nations have joined in during
the 20th century, with the newly emerging nations of sub-Saharan
Africa the latest to participate. Although the picture is not one of
universal progress, it is the greatest advance in the human
condition of the world’s population ever achieved in such a brief
span of time.</p>
<p>Rule of Law and Economic Growth</p>
<p><span id="bookmark544">Economic growth depends on many factors. Key
among those factors is adherence to the</span> <strong>rule of law</strong> and
protection of property rights and <strong>contractual rights</strong>
<a href="http://cnx.org/content/m63688/latest/" class="s34">by a country’s government so that markets can work effectively and efficiently. Laws must be clear, public, fair, enforced, and equally applicable to all members of society. Property rights, as you might recall from</a>
<a href="http://cnx.org/content/m63688/latest/" class="a">Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities (http://cnx.org/ content/m63688/latest/)</a><span
class="s54"> </span>are the rights of individuals and firms to own
property and use it as they see fit. If you have $100, you have the
right to use that money, whether you spend it, lend it, or keep it
in a jar. It is your property. The definition of property includes
physical property as well as the right to your training and
experience, especially<span id="bookmark545">‌</span></p>
<p>since your training is what determines your livelihood. Using this
property includes the right to enter into contracts with other
parties with your property. Individuals or firms must own the
property to enter into a contract.</p>
<p>Contractual rights, then, are based on property rights and they
allow individuals to enter into agreements with others regarding the
use of their property providing recourse through the legal system in
the event of noncompliance. One example is the employment agreement:
a skilled surgeon operates on an ill person and expects payment.
Failure to pay would constitute property theft by the patient. The
theft is property the services that the surgeon provided. In a
society with strong property rights and contractual rights, the
terms of the patient–surgeon contract will be fulfilled, because the
surgeon would have recourse through the court system to extract
payment from that individual. Without a legal system that enforces
contracts, people would not be likely to enter into contracts for
current or future services because of the risk of non-payment. This
would make it difficult to transact business and would slow economic
growth.</p>
<p>The World Bank considers a country’s legal system effective if it
upholds property rights and contractual rights. The World Bank has
developed a ranking system for countries’ legal systems based on
effective protection of property rights and rule-based governance
using a scale from 1 to 6, with 1 being the lowest and 6 the highest
rating. In 2013, the world average ranking was 2.9. The three
countries with the lowest ranking of 1.5 were Afghanistan, the
Central African Republic, and Zimbabwe. Their GDP per capita was
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(679, \)</span>333, and $1,007 respectively. The World Bank cites
Afghanistan as having a low standard of living, weak government
structure, and lack of adherence to the rule of law, which has
stymied its economic growth. The landlocked Central African Republic
has poor economic resources as well as political instability and is
a source of children used in human trafficking. Zimbabwe has had
declining and often negative growth for much of the period
since 1998. Land redistribution and price controls have disrupted
the economy, and corruption and violence have dominated the
political process. Although global economic growth has increased,
those countries lacking a clear system of property rights and an
independent court system free from corruption have lagged far
behind.</p>

<li><p><span id="bookmark532">|</span> <span style=" color: #3767B1;">Labor
Productivity and Economic Growth</span><span
id="bookmark546">‌</span></p>
<p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Identify the role of labor productivity in promoting economic
growth</p></li>
<li><p>Analyze the sources of economic growth using the aggregate
production function</p></li>
<li><p>Measure an economy’s rate of productivity growth</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate the power of sustained growth</p>
<p><span id="bookmark547">Sustained long-term economic growth comes
from increases in worker productivity, which essentially means
how well we do things. In other words, how efficient is your
nation with its time and workers?</span> <strong>Labor productivity</strong>
is the value that each employed person creates per unit of his
or her input. The easiest way to comprehend labor productivity
is to imagine a Canadian worker who can make 10 loaves of bread
in an hour versus a U.S. worker who in the same hour can make
only two loaves of bread. In this fictional example, the
Canadians are more productive. More productivity essentially
means you can do more in the same amount of time. This in turn
frees up resources for workers to use elsewhere.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark548">What determines how productive workers
are? The answer is pretty intuitive. The first determinant of
labor productivity is human capital.</span> <strong>Human capital</strong> is
the accumulated knowledge (from education and experience),
skills, and expertise that the average worker in an economy
possesses. Typically the higher the average level of education
in an economy, the higher the accumulated human capital and the
higher the labor productivity.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark549">The second factor that determines labor
productivity is technological change.</span> <strong>Technological
change</strong> is a combination of <strong>invention</strong>—advances in
knowledge—and <strong>innovation</strong>, which is putting those advances to
use in a new product or service. For example, the transistor was
invented in 1947. It allowed us to miniaturize the footprint of
electronic devices and use less power than the tube technology
that came before it. Innovations since then have produced
smaller and better transistors that are ubiquitous in products
as varied as smart-phones, computers, and escalators. Developing
the transistor has allowed workers to be anywhere with smaller
devices. People can use these devices to communicate with other
workers, measure product quality or do any other task in less
time, improving worker productivity.<span
id="bookmark550">‌</span></p>
<p><a href="http://cnx.org/content/m63680/latest/" class="s34">The third factor that determines labor productivity is economies of scale. Recall that economies of scale are the cost advantages that industries obtain due to size. (Read more about economies of scale in</a>
<a href="http://cnx.org/content/m63680/latest/" class="a">Production, Cost and Industry Structure (http://cnx.org/content/m63680/latest/)</a>
<span class="p">.) Consider again the case of the
fictional</span></p>
<p>Canadian worker who could produce 10 loaves of bread in an hour.
If this difference in productivity was due only to economies of
scale, it could be that the Canadian worker had access to a
large industrial-size oven while the U.S. worker was using a
standard residential size oven.</p>
<p>Now that we have explored the determinants of worker
productivity, let’s turn to how economists measure economic
growth and productivity.</p>
<p>Sources of Economic Growth: The Aggregate Production Function</p>
<p><span id="bookmark551">To analyze the sources of economic
growth, it is useful to think about a</span> <strong>production
function</strong>, which is the technical relationship by which
economic inputs like labor, machinery, and raw materials are
turned into outputs like goods and services that consumers use.
A microeconomic production function describes a firm’s or
perhaps an industry’s inputs and outputs. In macroeconomics, we
call the connection from inputs to outputs for the entire
economy an <strong>aggregate production function</strong>.<span
id="bookmark552">‌</span></p>
<p>Components of the Aggregate Production Function</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark553" class="s34">Economists construct different production functions depending on the focus of their studies.</a>
<a href="#bookmark553" class="a">Figure 7.2</a>
<a href="#bookmark553" class="s34">presents two examples of aggregate production functions. In the first production function in</a>
<a href="#bookmark553" class="a">Figure 7.2</a> <span
class="p">(a), the output is GDP. The inputs in this example are
workforce, human capital, physical capital, and technology. We
discuss these inputs further in the module, Components of
Economic Growth.</span></p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_168.jpg" width="316" height="471" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark553">Figure 7.2 Aggregate Production
Functions</span> <span class="s37">An aggregate production
function shows what goes into producing the output for an
overall economy. (a) This aggregate production function has GDP
as its output. (b) This aggregate production function has GDP
per capita as its output. Because we calculate it on a
per-person basis, we already figure the labor input into the
other factors and we do not need to list it separately.</span></p>
<p>Measuring Productivity</p>
<p>An economy’s rate of productivity growth is closely linked to
the growth rate of its GDP per capita, although the two are not
identical. For example, if the percentage of the population who
holds jobs in an economy increases, GDP per capita will increase
but the productivity of individual workers may not be affected.
Over the long term, the only way that GDP per capita can grow
continually is if the productivity of the average worker rises
or if there are complementary increases in capital.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark554" class="s34">A common measure of U.S. productivity per worker is dollar value per hour the worker contributes to the employer’s output. This measure excludes government workers, because their output is not sold in the market and so their productivity is hard to measure. It also excludes farming, which accounts for only a relatively small share of the U.S. economy.</a>
<a href="#bookmark554" class="a">Figure 7.3</a> <span
class="p">shows an index of output per hour, with 2009 as the
base year (when the index equals 100). The index equaled about
106 in 2014. In 1972, the index equaled 50, which shows that
workers have more than doubled their productivity since
then.</span></p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_169.jpg" width="427" height="317" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark554">Figure 7.3 Output per Hour Worked in the
U.S. Economy, 1947–2011</span> <span class="s37">Output per hour
worked is a measure of worker productivity. In the U.S. economy,
worker productivity rose more quickly in the 1960s and the
mid-1990s compared with the 1970s and 1980s. However, these
growth-rate differences are only a few percentage points per
year. Look carefully to see them in the changing slope of the
line. The average U.S. worker produced over twice as much per
hour in 2014 than he did in the early 1970s. (Source: U.S.
Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics.)</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark555" class="s34">According to the Department of Labor, U.S. productivity growth was fairly strong in the 1950s but then declined in the 1970s and 1980s before rising again in the second half of the 1990s and the first half of the 2000s. In fact, the rate of productivity measured by the change in output per hour worked averaged 3.2% per year from 1950 to 1970; dropped to 1.9% per year from 1970 to 1990; and then climbed back to over 2.3% from 1991 to the present, with another modest slowdown after 2001.</a>
<a href="#bookmark555" class="a">Figure 7.4</a> <span
class="p">shows average annual rates of productivity growth
averaged over time since 1950.</span></p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_170.jpg" width="374" height="352" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark555">Figure 7.4 Productivity Growth Since
1950</span> <span class="s37">U.S. growth in worker productivity
was very high between 1950 and 1970. It then declined to lower
levels in the 1970s and the 1980s. The late 1990s and early
2000s saw productivity rebound, but then productivity sagged a
bit in the 2000s. Some think the productivity rebound of the
late 1990s and early 2000s marks the start of a “new economy”
built on higher productivity growth, but we cannot determine
this until more time has passed. (Source: U.S. Department of
Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics.)</span></p>
<p>The “New Economy” Controversy</p>
<p>In recent years a controversy has been brewing among economists
about the resurgence of U.S. productivity in the second half of
the 1990s. One school of thought argues that the United States
had developed a “new economy” based on the extraordinary
advances in communications and information technology of the
1990s. The most optimistic proponents argue that it would
generate higher average productivity growth for decades to come.
The pessimists, alternatively, argue that even five or ten years
of stronger productivity growth does not prove that higher
productivity will last for the long term. It is hard to infer
anything about long-term productivity trends during the later
part of the 2000s, because the steep 2008-2009 recession, with
its sharp but not completely synchronized declines in output and
employment, complicates any interpretation. While productivity
growth was high in 2009 and 2010 (around 3%), it has slowed down
since then.</p>

<p><span id="bookmark557">Comparing the Economies of Two
Countries</span></p>
<p>The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) tracks data on the annual growth rate of real GDP per
hour worked. You can find these data on the OECD data webpage
“Growth in GDP per capita,</p>
<p><span id="bookmark556">Productivity growth is also closely
linked to the average level of wages. Over time, the amount that
firms are willing to pay workers will depend on the value of the
output those workers produce. If a few employers tried to pay
their workers less than what those workers produced, then those
workers would receive offers of higher wages from other
profit-seeking employers. If a few employers mistakenly paid
their workers more than what those workers produced, those
employers would soon end up with losses. In the long run,
productivity per hour is the most important determinant of the
average wage level in any economy. To learn how to compare
economies in this regard, follow the steps in the following Work

<p>Table 7.2</p>
<p>Step 5. For both measures, growth in Canada is greater than
growth in Belgium for the first four years. In addition, there
are year-to-year fluctuations. Many factors can affect growth.
For example, one factor that may have contributed to Canada’s
stronger growth may be its larger inflows of immigrants, who
generally contribute to economic growth.</p>
<p>The Power of Sustained Economic Growth</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark559" class="s34">Nothing is more important for people’s standard of living than sustained economic growth. Even small changes in the rate of growth, when sustained and compounded over long periods of time, make an enormous difference in the standard of living. Consider</a>
<a href="#bookmark559" class="a">Table</a> 7.3<span class="p">,
in which the rows of the table show several different rates of
growth in GDP per capita and the columns show different periods
of time. Assume for simplicity that an economy starts with a GDP
per capita of 100. The table then applies the following formula
to calculate what GDP will be at the given growth rate in the
future:</span></p>
<p>GDP at starting date × (1 + growth rate of GDP)<span
class="s88">years</span><span class="s89"> </span>= GDP at end
date</p>
<p>For example, an economy that starts with a GDP of 100 and grows
at 3% per year will reach a GDP of 209 after 25 years; that is,
100 (1.03)<span class="s28">25</span> = 209.</p>
<p>The slowest rate of GDP per capita growth in the table, just 1%
per year, is similar to what the United States experienced
during its weakest years of productivity growth. The second
highest rate, 3% per year, is close to what the U.S. economy
experienced during the strong economy of the late 1990s and into
the 2000s. Higher rates of per capita growth, such as 5% or 8%
per year, represent the experience of rapid growth in economies
like Japan, Korea, and China.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark559" class="a">Table 7.3</a> <span
class="p">shows that even a few percentage points of difference
in economic growth rates will have a profound effect if
sustained and compounded over time. For example, an economy
growing at a 1% annual rate over 50 years will see its GDP per
capita rise by a total of 64%, from 100 to 164 in this example.
However, a country growing at a 5% annual rate will see (almost)
the same amount of growth—from 100 to 163—over just 10 years.
Rapid rates of economic growth can bring profound
transformation. (See the following Clear It Up feature on the
relationship between compound growth rates and compound interest
rates.) If the rate of growth is 8%, young adults starting
at</span></p>
<p>age 20 will see the average standard of living in their country
more than double by the time they reach age 30, and grow nearly
sixfold by the time they reach age 45.</p>

<p>How are compound growth rates and compound interest rates
related?</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark554" class="s84">The formula for GDP growth rates over different periods of time, as</a>
<a href="#bookmark554" class="s43">Figure 7.3</a>
<a href="#bookmark96" class="s84">shows, is exactly the same as the formula for how a given amount of financial savings grows at a certain interest rate over time, as presented in</a>
<a href="#bookmark96" class="s43">Choice in a World of</a>
Scarcity<span class="s37">. Both formulas have the same
ingredients:</span></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>an original starting amount, in one case GDP and in the
other case an amount of financial saving;</p></li>
<li><p>a percentage increase over time, in one case the GDP growth
rate and in the other case an interest rate;</p></li>
<li><p>and an amount of time over which this effect happens.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="bookmark560">Recall that compound interest is interest
that is earned on past interest. It causes the total amount of
financial savings to grow dramatically over time. Similarly,
compound rates of economic growth, or the</span> <strong>compound growth
rate</strong>, means that we multiply the rate of growth by a base that
includes past GDP growth, with dramatic effects over time.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark561" class="s84">For example, in 2013, the Central Intelligence Agency’s World Fact Book reported that South Korea had a GDP of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1.67 trillion with a growth rate of 2.8%. We can estimate that at that growth rate, South Korea’s GDP will be \)</span>1.92 trillion in five years. If we apply the growth rate to each year’s ending GDP for the next five years, we will calculate that at the end of year one, GDP is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1.72 trillion. In year two, we start with the end-of-year one value of \)</span>1.72 and increase it by 2.8%. Year three starts with the end-of-year two GDP, and we increase it by 2.8% and so on, as</a>

<p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Discuss the components of economic growth, including physical
capital, human capital, and technology</p></li>
<li><p>Explain capital deepening and its significance</p></li>
<li><p>Analyze the methods employed in economic growth accounting studies</p></li>

</ul>
<p>Over decades and generations, seemingly small differences of a few
percentage points in the annual rate of economic growth make an enormous
difference in GDP per capita. In this module, we discuss some of the
components of economic growth, including physical capital, human
capital, and technology.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark563">The category of</span> <strong>physical capital</strong>
includes the plant and equipment that firms use as well as things like
roads (also called <strong>infrastructure</strong>). Again, greater physical capital
implies more output. Physical capital can affect productivity in two
ways: (1) an increase in the <em>quantity</em> of physical capital (for
example, more computers of the same quality); and<span
id="bookmark564">‌</span></p>
<ol>
<li><p><span id="bookmark565">an increase in the</span> <em>quality</em> of
physical capital (same number of computers but the computers are
faster, and so on). <strong>Human capital</strong> refers to the skills and
knowledge that make workers productive. Human capital and physical
capital accumulation are similar: In both cases, investment now pays
off in higher productivity in the future.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark566">The category of</span> <strong>technology</strong> is the
“joker in the deck.” Earlier we described it as the combination of
invention and innovation. When most people think of new technology,
the invention of new products like the laser, the smartphone, or
some new wonder drug come to mind. In food production, developing
more drought-resistant seeds is another example of technology.
Technology, as economists use the term, however, includes still
more. It includes new ways of organizing work, like the invention of
the assembly line, new methods for ensuring better quality of output
in factories, and innovative institutions that facilitate the
process of converting inputs into output. In short, technology
comprises all the advances that make the existing machines and other
inputs produce more, and at higher quality, as well as altogether
new products.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark567">It may not make sense to compare the GDPs of
China and say, Benin, simply because of the great difference in
population size. To understand economic growth, which is really
concerned with the growth in living standards of an average person,
it is often useful to focus on GDP per capita. Using GDP per capita
also makes it easier to compare countries with smaller numbers of
people, like Belgium, Uruguay, or Zimbabwe, with countries that have
larger populations, like the United States, the Russian Federation,
or Nigeria.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark553" id="bookmark568" class="s34">To obtain a per capita production function, divide each input in</a>
<a href="#bookmark553" class="a">Figure</a>
7.2<a href="#bookmark553" class="s34">(a) by the population. This creates a second aggregate production function where the output is GDP per capita (that is, GDP divided by population). The inputs are the average level of human capital per person, the average level of physical capital per person, and the level of technology per person—see</a>
<a href="#bookmark553" class="a">Figure</a> 7.2<span class="p">(b).
The result of having population in the denominator is mathematically
appealing. Increases in population lower per capita income. However,
increasing population is important for the average person only if
the rate of income growth exceeds population growth. A more
important reason for constructing a per capita production function
is to understand the contribution of human and physical
capital.</span></p>
<p>Capital Deepening</p>
<p><span id="bookmark569">When society increases the level of capital
per person, we call the result</span> <strong>capital deepening</strong>. The
idea of capital deepening can apply both to additional human capital
per worker and to additional physical capital per worker.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark570" class="s34">Recall that one way to measure human capital is to look at the average levels of education in an economy.</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark570">Figure</a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark570" class="a">7.5</a> <span class="p">illustrates
the human capital deepening for U.S. workers by showing that the
proportion of the U.S. population with a high school and a college
degree is rising. As recently as 1970, for example, only about half
of U.S. adults had at least a high school diploma. By the start of
the twenty-first century, more than 80% of adults had graduated from
high school. The idea of human capital deepening also applies to the
years of experience that workers have, but the average experience
level of U.S. workers has not changed much in recent decades. Thus,
the key dimension for deepening human capital in the U.S. economy
focuses more on additional education and training than on a higher
average level of work experience.</span></p>

<p><span id="bookmark570">Figure 7.5 Human Capital Deepening in the
U.S.</span> <span class="s37">Rising levels of education for persons
25 and older show the deepening of human capital in the U.S.
economy. Even today, under one-third of U.S. adults have completed a
four- year college degree. There is clearly room for additional
deepening of human capital to occur. (Source: US Department of
Education, National Center for Education Statistics)</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark571" class="a">Figure 7.6</a> <span
class="p">shows physical capital deepening in the U.S. economy. The
average U.S. worker in the late 2000s was working with physical
capital worth almost three times as much as that of the average
worker of the early 1950s.</span></p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_175.jpg" width="442" height="378" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark571">Figure 7.6 Physical Capital per Worker in the
United States</span> <span class="s37">The value of the physical
capital, measured by plant and equipment, used by the average worker
in the U.S. economy has risen over the decades. The increase may
have leveled off a bit in the 1970s and 1980s, which were, not
coincidentally, times of slower-than-usual growth in worker
productivity. We see a renewed increase in physical capital per
worker in the late 1990s, followed by a flattening in the early
2000s. (Source: Center for International Comparisons of Production,
Income and Prices, University of Pennsylvania)</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark572">Not only does the current U.S. economy have
better-educated workers with more and improved physical capital than
it did several decades ago, but these workers have access to more
advanced technologies. Growth in technology is impossible to measure
with a simple line on a graph, but evidence that we live in an age
of technological marvels is all around us—discoveries in genetics
and in the structure of particles, the wireless internet, and other
inventions almost too numerous to count. The U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office typically has issued more than 150,000 patents
annually in recent years.</span></p>
<p>This recipe for economic growth—investing in labor productivity,
with investments in human capital and technology, as well as
increasing physical capital—also applies to other economies. South
Korea, for example, already achieved universal enrollment in primary
school (the equivalent of kindergarten through sixth grade in the
United States) by 1965, when Korea’s GDP per capita was still near
its rock bottom low. By the late 1980s, Korea had achieved almost
universal secondary school education (the equivalent of a high
school education in the United States). With regard to physical
capital, Korea’s rates of investment had been about 15% of GDP at
the start of the 1960s, but doubled to 30–35% of GDP by the late
1960s and early 1970s. With regard to technology, South Korean
students went to universities and colleges around the world to
obtain scientific and technical training, and South Korean firms
reached out to study and form partnerships with firms that could
offer them technological insights. These factors combined to foster
South Korea’s high rate of economic growth.</p>
<p>Growth Accounting Studies</p>
<p>Since the late 1950s, economists have conducted growth accounting
studies to determine the extent to which physical and human capital
deepening and technology have contributed to growth. The usual
approach uses an aggregate production function to estimate how much
of per capita economic growth can be attributed to growth in
physical capital and human capital. We can measure these two inputs
at least roughly. The part of growth that is unexplained by measured
inputs, called the residual, is then attributed to growth in
technology. The exact numerical estimates differ from study to study
and from country to country, depending on how researchers measured
these three main</p>
<p>factors and over what time horizons. For studies of the U.S.
economy, three lessons commonly emerge from growth accounting
studies.</p>
<p>First, technology is typically the most important contributor to
U.S. economic growth. Growth in human capital and physical capital
often explains only half or less than half of the economic growth
that occurs. New ways of doing things are tremendously important.</p>
<p>Second, while investment in physical capital is essential to growth
in labor productivity and GDP per capita, building human capital is
at least as important. Economic growth is not just a matter of more
machines and buildings. One vivid example of the power of human
capital and technological knowledge occurred in Europe in the years
after World War II (1939–1945). During the war, a large share of
Europe’s physical capital, such as factories, roads, and vehicles,
was destroyed. Europe also lost an overwhelming amount of human
capital in the form of millions of men, women, and children who died
during the war. However, the powerful combination of skilled workers
and technological knowledge, working within a market-oriented
economic framework, rebuilt Europe’s productive capacity to an even
higher level within less than two decades.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_176.png" width="624" height="51" alt="image" />
<p>How do girls’ education and economic growth relate in low- income
countries?</p>
<p>In the early 2000s, according to the World Bank, about 110 million
children between the ages of 6 and 11 were not in school—and about
two-thirds of them were girls. In Afghanistan, for example, the
literacy rate for those aged 15-24 for the period 2005-2014 was 62%
for males and only 32% for females. In Benin, in West Africa, it was
55% for males and 31% for females. In Nigeria, Africa’s most
populous country, it was 76% for males and 58 percent for females.</p>
<p>Whenever any child does not receive a basic education, it is both a
human and an economic loss. In low- income countries, wages
typically increase by an average of 10 to 20% with each additional
year of education. There is, however, some intriguing evidence that
helping girls in low-income countries to close the education gap
with boys may be especially important, because of the social role
that many of the girls will play as mothers and homemakers.</p>
<p>Girls in low-income countries who receive more education tend to
grow up to have fewer, healthier, better- educated children. Their
children are more likely to be better nourished and to receive basic
health care like immunizations. Economic research on women in
low-income economies backs up these findings. When 20 women obtain
one additional year of schooling, as a group they will, on average,
have one less child. When 1,000 women obtain one additional year of
schooling, on average one to two fewer women from that group will
die in childbirth. When a woman stays in school an additional year,
that factor alone means that, on average, each of her children will
spend an additional half-year in school. Education for girls is a
good investment because it is an investment in economic growth with
benefits beyond the current generation.</p>
<p>A third lesson is that these three factors of human capital,
physical capital, and technology work together. Workers with a
higher level of education and skills are often better at coming up
with new technological innovations. These technological innovations
are often ideas that cannot increase production until they become a
part of new investment in physical capital. New machines that embody
technological innovations often require additional training, which
builds worker skills further. If the recipe for economic growth is
to succeed, an economy needs all the ingredients of the aggregate
production function. See the following Clear It Up feature for an
example of how human capital, physical capital, and technology can
combine to significantly impact lives.</p>
<p>A Healthy Climate for Economic Growth</p>
<p>While physical and human capital deepening and better technology are
important, equally important to a nation’s well-being is the climate
or system within which these inputs are cultivated. Both the type of
market economy and a legal system that governs and sustains property
rights and contractual rights are important contributors to a
healthy economic climate.</p>
<p>A healthy economic climate usually involves some sort of market
orientation at the microeconomic, individual, or firm
decision-making level. Markets that allow personal and business
rewards and incentives for increasing human and physical capital
encourage overall macroeconomic growth. For example, when workers
participate in a competitive and well-functioning labor market, they
have an incentive to acquire additional human capital, because
additional education and skills will pay off in higher wages. Firms
have an incentive to invest in physical capital and in training
workers, because they expect to earn higher profits for their
shareholders. Both individuals and firms look for new technologies,
because even small inventions can make work easier or lead to
product improvement. Collectively, such individual and business
decisions made within a market structure add up to macroeconomic
growth. Much of the rapid growth since the late nineteenth century
has come from harnessing the power of competitive markets to
allocate resources. This market orientation typically reaches beyond
national borders and includes openness to international trade.</p>
<p>A general orientation toward markets does not rule out important
roles for government. There are times when markets fail to allocate
capital or technology in a manner that provides the greatest benefit
for society as a whole. The government’s role is to correct these
failures. In addition, government can guide or influence markets
toward certain outcomes. The following examples highlight some
important areas that governments around the world have chosen to
invest in to facilitate capital deepening and technology:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Education. The Danish government requires all children under 16
to attend school. They can choose to attend a public school
(<em>Folkeskole</em>) or a private school. Students do not pay tuition
to attend <em>Folkeskole</em>. Thirteen percent of primary/secondary
(elementary/high) school is private, and the government supplies
vouchers to citizens who choose private school.</p></li>
<li><p>Savings and Investment. In the United States, as in other
countries, the government taxes gains from private investment.
Low capital gains taxes encourage investment and so also
economic growth.</p></li>
<li><p>Infrastructure. The Japanese government in the mid-1990s
undertook significant infrastructure projects to improve roads
and public works. This in turn increased the stock of physical
capital and ultimately economic growth.</p></li>
<li><p><span id="bookmark573">Special Economic Zones. The island of
Mauritius is one of the few African nations to encourage
international trade in government-supported</span> <strong>special
economic zones (SEZ)</strong>. These are areas of the country, usually
with access to a port where, among other benefits, the
government does not tax trade. As a result of its SEZ, Mauritius
has enjoyed above-average economic growth since the 1980s. Free
trade does not have to occur in an SEZ however. Governments can
encourage international trade across the board, or surrender to
protectionism.</p></li>
<li><p><span id="bookmark574">Scientific Research. The European Union
has strong programs to invest in scientific research. The
researchers Abraham García and Pierre Mohnen demonstrate that
firms which received support from the Austrian government
actually increased their research intensity and had more sales.
Governments can support scientific research and technical
training that helps to create and spread new technologies.
Governments can also provide a legal environment that protects
the ability of inventors to profit from their inventions.</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#bookmark1530" class="s34">There are many more ways in which the government can play an active role in promoting economic growth. We explore them in other chapters and in particular in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1530" class="a">Macroeconomic Policy Around the</a>
World<span class="p">. A healthy climate for growth in GDP per
capita and labor productivity includes human capital deepening,
physical capital deepening, and technological gains, operating in a
market-oriented economy with supportive government policies.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When countries with lower GDP levels per capita catch up to countries
with higher GDP levels per capita, we call the process convergence.
Convergence can occur even when both high- and low-income countries
increase investment in physical and human capital with the objective of
growing GDP. This is because the impact of new investment in physical
and human capital on a low-income country may result in huge gains as
new skills or equipment combine with the labor force. In higher-income
countries, however, a level of investment equal to that of the low
income country is not likely to have as big an impact, because the more
developed country most likely already has high levels of capital
investment. Therefore, the marginal gain from this additional investment
tends to be successively less and less. Higher income countries are more
likely to have diminishing returns to their investments and must
continually invent new technologies. This allows lower-income economies
to have a chance for convergent growth. However, many high-income
economies have developed economic and political institutions that
provide a healthy economic climate for an ongoing stream of
technological innovations. Continuous technological innovation can
counterbalance diminishing returns to investments in human and physical
capital.</p>

<p>Unemployment and the Great Recession</p>
<p>Nearly eight million U.S. jobs were lost as a consequence of the Great
Recession, which lasted from December 2007 to June 2009. At the outset
of the recession, the unemployment rate was 5.0%. The rate began rising
several months after the recession began, and it peaked at 10.0% in
October 2009, several months after the recession ended, according to the
Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The job loss represented a huge number
of positions gone. Subsequently, the recovery was tepid. Companies added
some positions, but as of summer 2013, four years after the end of the
recession, unemployment was about 7.5%, well above the pre-recession
rate. Employment began increasing at the outset of 2010, and reached its
pre-recession level in mid-2014. However, because of population and
labor force growth, the unemployment rate at that point was still
slightly above 6%. The economy only returned to an unemployment rate of
5.0% in September 2015, and it has remained at or slightly below that
level since then, up through January 2017.</p>
<p>This brief overview of unemployment during and after the Great Recession
highlights a few important points. First, unemployment is a lagging
indicator of business activity. It didn’t begin to increase until a few
months after the onset of the recession, and it didn’t begin to decline
until several months after the recovery. Second, the decline in the
unemployment rate was quite slow, with the pre-recession unemployment
rate only reaching a higher level than six years after the recession
ended. This reflects a combination of slow increase in the number of
jobs and ongoing increases in the size of the population and the labor
force.</p>
<p>It turns out that recent recessions, going back to the early 1990s, have
been characterized by longer periods of recovery than their
predecessors. We will return to this point at the end of the chapter.
However, first we</p>

it?</p>

<p><a href="#bookmark577" class="s34">Each of the countries in</a>
<a href="#bookmark577" class="a">Table</a> 7.5 <span class="p">has
its own unique story of investments in human and physical capital,
technological gains, market forces, government policies, and even
lucky events, but an overall pattern of convergence is clear. The
low-income countries have GDP growth that is faster than that of the
middle-income countries, which in turn have GDP growth that is
faster than that of the high-income countries. Two prominent members
of the fast- growth club are China and India, which between them
have nearly 40% of the world’s population. Some prominent members of
the slow-growth club are high-income countries like France, Germany,
Italy, and Japan.</span></p>
<p>Will this pattern of economic convergence persist into the future?
This is a controversial question among economists that we will
consider by looking at some of the main arguments on both sides.</p>
<p>Arguments Favoring Convergence</p>
<p>Several arguments suggest that low-income countries might have an
advantage in achieving greater worker productivity and economic
growth in the future.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark578">A first argument is based on diminishing
marginal returns. Even though deepening human and physical capital
will tend to increase GDP per capita, the law of diminishing returns
suggests that as an economy continues to increase its human and
physical capital, the marginal gains to economic growth will
diminish. For example, raising the average education level of the
population by two years from a tenth-grade level to a high school
diploma (while holding all other inputs constant) would produce a
certain increase in output. An additional two-year increase, so that
the average person had a two-year college degree, would increase
output further, but the marginal gain would be smaller. Yet another
additional two-year increase in the level of education, so that the
average person would have a four-year- college bachelor’s degree,
would increase output still further, but the marginal increase would
again be smaller. A similar lesson holds for physical capital. If
the quantity of physical capital available to the average worker
increases, by, say, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(5,000 to \)</span>10,000 (again, while holding all
other inputs constant), it will increase the level of output. An
additional increase from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10,000 to \)</span>15,000 will increase output
further, but the marginal increase will be smaller.</span></p>
<p>Low-income countries like China and India tend to have lower levels
of human capital and physical capital, so an investment in capital
deepening should have a larger marginal effect in these countries
than in high-income countries, where levels of human and physical
capital are already relatively high. Diminishing returns implies
that low-income economies could converge to the levels that the
high-income countries achieve.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark579">A second argument is that low-income
countries may find it easier to improve their technologies than
high-income countries. High-income countries must continually invent
new technologies, whereas low-income countries can often find ways
of applying technology that has already been invented and is well
understood. The economist Alexander Gerschenkron (1904–1978) gave
this phenomenon a memorable name: “the advantages of backwardness.”
Of course, he did not literally mean that it is an advantage to have
a lower standard of living. He was pointing out that a country that
is behind has some extra potential for catching up.</span></p>
<p>Finally, optimists argue that many countries have observed the
experience of those that have grown more quickly and have learned
from it. Moreover, once the people of a country begin to enjoy the
benefits of a higher standard of living, they may be more likely to
build and support the market-friendly institutions that will help
provide this standard of living.</p>

<p>Arguments That Convergence Is neither Inevitable nor Likely</p>
<p>If the economy’s growth depended only on the deepening of human
capital and physical capital, then we would expect that economy’s
growth rate to slow down over the long run because of diminishing
marginal returns. However, there is another crucial factor in the
aggregate production function: technology.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark580" class="s34">Developing new technology can provide a way for an economy to sidestep the diminishing marginal returns of capital deepening.</a>
<a href="#bookmark580" class="a">Figure 7.7</a><span class="s54">
</span>shows how. The figure’s horizontal axis measures the amount
of capital deepening, which on this figure is an overall measure
that includes deepening of both physical and human capital. The
amount of human and physical capital per worker increases as you
move from left to right, from C<span class="s60">1</span> to C<span
class="s60">2</span> to C<span class="s60">3</span>. The diagram’s
vertical axis measures per capita output. Start by considering the
lowest line in this diagram, labeled Technology 1. Along this
aggregate production function, the level of technology is held
constant, so the line shows only the relationship between capital
deepening and output. As capital deepens from C<span
class="s60">1</span> to C<span class="s60">2</span> to C<span
class="s60">3</span> and the economy moves from R to U to W, per
capita output does increase—but the way in which the line starts out
steeper on the left but then flattens as it moves to the right shows
the diminishing marginal returns, as additional marginal amounts of
capital deepening increase output by ever-smaller amounts. The shape
of the aggregate production line (Technology 1) shows that the
ability of capital deepening, by itself, to generate sustained
economic growth is limited, since diminishing returns will
eventually set in.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_180.jpg" width="252" height="176" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark580"><span class="s36">Figure 7.7 Capital
Deepening and New Technology </span></span>Imagine that the economy
starts at point R, with the level of physical and human capital
C<span class="s63">1</span> and the output per capita at G<span
class="s63">1</span>. If the economy relies only on capital
deepening, while remaining at the technology level shown by the
Technology 1 line, then it would face diminishing marginal returns
as it moved from point R to point U to point W. However, now imagine
that capital deepening is combined with improvements in technology.
Then, as capital deepens from C<span class="s63">1</span> to C<span
class="s63">2</span>, technology improves from Technology 1 to
Technology 2, and the economy moves from R to S. Similarly, as
capital deepens from C<span class="s63">2</span> to C<span
class="s63">3</span>, technology increases from Technology 2 to
Technology 3, and the economy moves from S to T. With improvements
in technology, there is no longer any reason that economic growth
must necessarily slow down.</p>
<p>Now, bring improvements in technology into the picture. Improved
technology means that with a given set of inputs, more output is
possible. The production function labeled Technology 1 in the figure
is based on one level of technology, but Technology 2 is based on an
improved level of technology, so for every level of capital
deepening on</p>
<p>the horizontal axis, it produces a higher level of output on the
vertical axis. In turn, production function Technology 3 represents
a still higher level of technology, so that for every level of
inputs on the horizontal axis, it produces a higher level of output
on the vertical axis than either of the other two aggregate
production functions.</p>
<p>Most healthy, growing economies are deepening their human and
physical capital and increasing technology at the same time. As a
result, the economy can move from a choice like point R on the
Technology 1 aggregate production line to a point like S on
Technology 2 and a point like T on the still higher aggregate
production line (Technology 3). With the combination of technology
and capital deepening, the rise in GDP per capita in high-income
countries does not need to fade away because of diminishing returns.
The gains from technology can offset the diminishing returns
involved with capital deepening.</p>
<p>Will technological improvements themselves run into diminishing
returns over time? That is, will it become continually harder and
more costly to discover new technological improvements? Perhaps
someday, but, at least over the last two centuries since the
beginning of the Industrial Revolution, improvements in technology
have not run into diminishing marginal returns. Modern inventions,
like the internet or discoveries in genetics or materials science,
do not seem to provide smaller gains to output than earlier
inventions like the steam engine or the railroad. One reason that
technological ideas do not seem to run into diminishing returns is
that we often can apply widely the ideas of new technology at a
marginal cost that is very low or even zero. A specific worker or
group of workers must use a specific additional machine, or an
additional year of education. Many workers across the economy can
use a new technology or invention at very low marginal cost.</p>

<p>The argument that it is easier for a low-income country to copy and
adapt existing technology than it is for a high-income country to
invent new technology is not necessarily true, either. When it comes
to adapting and using new technology, a society’s performance is not
necessarily guaranteed, but is the result of whether the country’s
economic, educational, and public policy institutions are
supportive. In theory, perhaps, low-income countries have many
opportunities to copy and adapt technology, but if they lack the
appropriate supportive economic infrastructure and institutions, the
theoretical possibility that backwardness might have certain
advantages is of little practical relevance.</p>
<p>The Slowness of Convergence</p>
<p>Although economic convergence between the high-income countries and
the rest of the world seems possible and even likely, it will
proceed slowly. Consider, for example, a country that starts off
with a GDP per capita of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(40,000, which would roughly represent a
typical high-income country today, and another country that starts
out at \)</span>4,000, which is roughly the level in low-income but not
impoverished countries like Indonesia, Guatemala, or Egypt. Say that
the rich country chugs along at a 2% annual growth rate of GDP per
capita, while the poorer country grows at the aggressive rate of 7%
per year. After 30 years, GDP per capita in the rich country will be
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(72,450 (that is, \)</span>40,000 (1</p>
<p>+ 0.02)<span class="s28">30</span>) while in the poor country it
will be <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(30,450 (that is, \)</span>4,000 (1 + 0.07)<span
class="s28">30</span>). Convergence has occurred. The rich country
used to be 10 times as wealthy as the poor one, and now it is only
about 2.4 times as wealthy. Even after 30 consecutive years of very
rapid growth, however, people in the low-income country are still
likely to feel quite poor compared to people in the rich country.
Moreover, as the poor country catches up, its opportunities for
catch-up growth are reduced, and its growth rate may slow down
somewhat.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_182.png" width="624" height="492" alt="image" />
<p>The slowness of convergence illustrates again that small differences
in annual rates of economic growth become huge differences over
time. The high-income countries have been building up their
advantage in standard of living over decades—more than a century in
some cases. Even in an optimistic scenario, it will take decades for
the low-income countries of the world to catch up significantly.</p>
<p>Calories and Economic Growth</p>
<p><span id="bookmark581">We can tell the story of modern economic
growth by looking at calorie consumption over time. The dramatic
rise in incomes allowed the average person to eat better and consume
more calories. How did these incomes increase? The neoclassical
growth consensus uses the aggregate production function to suggest
that the period of modern economic growth came about because of
increases in inputs such as technology and physical and human
capital. Also important was the way in which technological progress
combined with physical and human capital deepening to create growth
and convergence. The issue of distribution of income
notwithstanding, it is clear that the average worker can afford more
calories in 2017 than in 1875.</span></p>
<p>Aside from increases in income, there is another reason why the
average person can afford more food. Modern agriculture has allowed
many countries to produce more food than they need. Despite having
more than enough food, however, many governments and multilateral
agencies have not solved the food distribution problem. In fact,
food shortages, famine, or general food insecurity are caused more
often by the failure of government macroeconomic policy, according
to the Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen. Sen has conducted
extensive research into issues of inequality, poverty, and the role
of government in improving standards of living. Macroeconomic
policies that strive toward stable inflation, full employment,
education of women, and preservation of property rights are more
likely to eliminate starvation and provide for a more even
distribution of food.</p>
<p>Because we have more food per capita, global food prices have
decreased since 1875. The prices of some foods, however, have
decreased more than the prices of others. For example, researchers
from the University of Washington have shown that in the United
States, calories from zucchini and lettuce are 100 times more
expensive than calories from oil, butter, and sugar. Research from
countries like India, China, and the United States suggests that as
incomes rise, individuals want more calories from fats and protein
and fewer from carbohydrates. This has very interesting implications
for global food production, obesity, and environmental consequences.
Affluent urban India has an obesity problem much like many parts of
the United States. The forces of convergence are at work.</p>

<p>KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY</p>
<ol>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark538" class="a">The Relatively Recent Arrival of Economic</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark538">Growth</a></p>
<p>Since the early nineteenth century, there has been a spectacular
process of long-run economic growth during which the world’s
leading economies—mostly those in Western Europe and North
America—expanded GDP per capita at an average rate of about 2%
per year. In the last half-century, countries like Japan, South
Korea, and China have shown the potential to catch up. The
Industrial Revolution facilitated the extensive process of
economic growth, that economists often refer to as modern
economic growth. This increased worker productivity and trade,
as well as the</p>
<p>development of governance and market institutions.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark546" class="a">Labor Productivity and Economic</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark546">Growth</a></p>
<p>We can measure productivity, the value of what is produced per
worker, or per hour worked, as the level of GDP per worker or
GDP per hour. The United States experienced a productivity
slowdown between 1973 and 1989. Since then,</p>
<p>U.S. productivity has rebounded for the most part, but annual
growth in productivity in the nonfarm business sector has been
less than one percent each year between 2011 and 2016. It is not
clear what productivity growth will be in the coming years. The
rate of productivity growth is the primary determinant of an
economy’s rate of long-term economic growth and higher wages.
Over decades and generations, seemingly small differences of a
few percentage points in the annual rate of economic growth make
an enormous difference in GDP per capita. An aggregate
production function specifies how certain inputs in the economy,
like human capital, physical capital, and technology, lead to
the output measured as GDP per capita.</p>
<p>Compound interest and compound growth rates behave in the same
way as productivity rates. Seemingly small changes in percentage
points can have big impacts on income over time.</p>

<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark562">Growth</a></p>
<p>Over decades and generations, seemingly small differences of a
few percentage points in the annual rate of economic growth make
an enormous difference in GDP per capita. Capital deepening
refers to an increase in the amount of capital per worker,
either human capital per worker, in the form of higher education
or skills, or physical capital per worker. Technology, in its
economic meaning, refers broadly to all new methods of
production, which includes major scientific inventions but also
small inventions and even better forms of management or other
types of institutions. A healthy climate for growth in GDP per
capita consists of improvements in human capital, physical
capital, and technology, in a market-oriented environment with
supportive public policies and institutions.</p>

</ul>
<p>Unemployment can be a terrible and wrenching life experience—like a
serious automobile accident or a messy divorce—whose consequences only
someone who has gone through it can fully understand. For unemployed
individuals and their families, there is the day-to-day financial stress
of not knowing from where the next paycheck is coming. There are painful
adjustments, like watching your savings account dwindle, selling a car
and buying a cheaper one, or moving to a less expensive place to live.
Even when the unemployed person finds a new job, it may pay less than
the previous one. For many people, their job is an important part of
their self worth. When unemployment separates people from the workforce,
it can affect family relationships as well as mental and physical
health.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark620">The human costs of unemployment alone would
justify making a low level of unemployment an important public policy
priority. However, unemployment also includes economic costs to the
broader society. When millions of unemployed but willing workers cannot
find jobs, economic resource are unused. An economy with high
unemployment is like a company operating with a functional but unused
factory. The opportunity cost of unemployment is the output that the
unemployed workers could have produced.</span></p>
<p>This chapter will discuss how economists define and compute the
unemployment rate. It will examine the patterns of unemployment over
time, for the U.S. economy as a whole, for different demographic groups
in the U.S. economy, and for other countries. It will then consider an
economic explanation for unemployment, and how it explains the patterns
of unemployment and suggests public policies for reducing it.</p>

<p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Calculate the labor force participation rate and the

<li><p>Explain hidden unemployment and what it means to be in or out of

<li><p>Evaluate the collection and interpretation of unemployment data</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Newspaper or television reports typically describe unemployment as a
percentage or a rate. A recent report might have said, for example,
<em>from August 2009 to November 2009, the U.S. unemployment rate rose
from 9.7% to 10.0%, but by June 2010, it had fallen to 9.5%</em>. At a
glance, the changes between the percentages may seem small. However,
remember that the U.S. economy has about 160 million adults (as of
the beginning of 2017) who either have jobs or are looking for them.
A rise or fall of just 0.1% in the unemployment rate of 160 million
potential workers translates into 160,000 people, which is roughly
the total population of a city like Syracuse, New York, Brownsville,
Texas, or Pasadena, California. Large rises in the unemployment rate
mean large numbers of job losses. In November 2009, at the peak of
the recession, about 15 million people were out of work. Even with
the unemployment rate now at 4.8% as of January 2017, about 7.6
million people who would like to have jobs are out of work.</p>

unemployment.</span></p>
<p>Who’s In or Out of the Labor Force?</p>
<p>Should we count everyone without a job as unemployed? Of course not.
For example, we should not count children as unemployed. Surely, we
should not count the retired as unemployed. Many full-time college
students have only a part-time job, or no job at all, but it seems
inappropriate to count them as suffering the pains of unemployment.
Some people are not working because they are rearing children, ill,
on vacation, or on parental leave.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark622">The point is that we do not just divide the
adult population into employed and unemployed. A third group exists:
people who do not have a job, and for some reason—retirement,
looking after children, taking a voluntary break before a new
job—are not interested in having a job, either. It also includes
those who do want a job but have quit looking, often due to
discouragement due to their inability to find suitable employment.
Economists refer to this third group of those who are not working
and not looking for work as</span> <strong>out of the labor force</strong> or not
in the labor force.</p>
<p>The U.S. unemployment rate, which is based on a monthly survey
carried out by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, asks a series of
questions to divide the adult population into employed, unemployed,
or not in the labor force. To be classified as unemployed, a person
must be without a job, currently available to work, and actively
looking for work in the previous four weeks. Thus, a person who does
not have a job but who is not currently available to work or has not
actively looked for work in the last four weeks is counted as out of
the labor force.</p>
<p>Employed: currently working for pay</p>
<p>Unemployed: Out of work and actively looking for a job</p>
<p>Out of the labor force: Out of paid work and not actively looking
for a job Labor force: the number of employed plus the unemployed</p>
<p>Calculating the Unemployment Rate</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark624" id="bookmark623" class="a">Figure 8.2</a>
<a href="#bookmark625" class="s34">shows the three-way division of the 16-and-over population. In January 2017, about 62.9% of the adult population was “in the labor force”; that is, people are either employed or without a job but looking for work. We can divide those in the labor force into the employed and the unemployed.</a>
<a href="#bookmark625" class="a">Table 8.1</a> <span class="p">shows
those values. The </span><span class="s31">unemployment rate

in the labor force but who do not have jobs:</span></p>

<p>Calculating Labor Force Percentages</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark625" class="s84">How do economists arrive at the percentages in and out of the labor force and the unemployment rate? We will use the values in</a>
<a href="#bookmark625" class="s43">Table</a> 8.1 <span
class="s37">to illustrate the steps.</span></p>
<p>To determine the percentage in the labor force:</p>
<p>Step 1. Divide the number of people in the labor force (159.716
million) by the total adult (working-age) population (254.082
million).</p>
<p>Step 2. Multiply by 100 to obtain the percentage.</p>
<p>In this example, we can calculate the unemployment rate as 7.635
million unemployed people divided by 159.716 million people in the
labor force, which works out to a 4.8% rate of unemployment. The
following Work It Out feature will walk you through the steps of
this calculation.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_188.png" width="624" height="354" alt="image" />
<p>Percentage in the labor force =</p>
<p>159.716</p>
<p>= 0.6286</p>
<p>= 62.9%</p>
<p>254.082</p>
<p>To determine the percentage out of the labor force:</p>
<p>Step 1. Divide the number of people out the labor force (94.366
million) by the total adult (working-age) population (254.082
million).</p>
<p>Step 2. Multiply by 100 to obtain the percentage.</p>
<p>Percentage in the labor force = <u>94.366</u></p>
<p>= 0.3714</p>
<p>= 37.1%</p>
<p>254.082</p>
<p>To determine the unemployment rate:</p>
<p>Step 1. Divide the number of unemployed people (7.635 million) by
the total labor force (157 million). Step 2. Multiply by 100 to
obtain the rate.</p>
<p>Unemployment rate = <u>   7.635  </u></p>
<p>159.716</p>
<p>= 0.0478</p>
<p>= 4.8%</p>
<p>Hidden Unemployment</p>
<p><span id="bookmark626">Even with the “out of the labor force”
category, there are still some people who are mislabeled in the
categorization of employed, unemployed, or out of the labor force.
There are some people who have only part time or temporary jobs, and
they are looking for full time and permanent employment that are
counted as employed, although they are not employed in the way they
would like or need to be. Additionally, there are individuals who
are</span> <strong>underemployed</strong>. This includes those who are trained or
skilled for one type or level of work but are working in a lower
paying job or one that does not utilize their skills. For example,
we would consider an individual with a college degree in finance who
is working as a sales clerk underemployed. They are, however, also
counted in the employed group. All of these individuals fall under
the umbrella of the term “hidden unemployment.” <strong>Discouraged
workers</strong>, those who have stopped looking for employment and, hence,
are no longer counted in the unemployed also fall into this
group<span id="bookmark627">‌</span></p>
<p>Labor Force Participation Rate</p>
<p><span id="bookmark628"><span class="p">Another important statistic
is the </span></span><span class="s31">labor force participation
rate</span><a href="#bookmark624" class="s34">. This is the percentage of adults in an economy who are either employed or who are unemployed and looking for a job. Using the data in</a>
<a href="#bookmark624" class="a">Figure 8.2</a>
<a href="#bookmark625" class="s34">and</a>
<a href="#bookmark625" class="a">Table</a> 8.1<span class="p">,
those included in this calculation would be the 159.716 million
individuals in the labor force. We calculate the rate by taking the
number of people in the labor force, that is, the number employed
and the number unemployed, divided by the total adult population and
multiplying by 100 to get the percentage. For the data from January
2017, the labor force participation rate is 62.9%. Historically, the
civilian labor force participation rate in the United States climbed
beginning in the 1960s as women increasingly entered the workforce,
and it peaked at just over 67% in late 1999 to early 2000. Since
then, the labor force participation rate has steadily declined,
slowly to about 66% in 2008, early in the Great Recession, and then
more rapidly during and after that recession, reaching its present
level, where it has remained stable, near the end of 2013.</span></p>
<p>The Establishment Payroll Survey</p>
<p>When the unemployment report comes out each month, the Bureau of
Labor Statistics (BLS) also reports on the number of jobs
created—which comes from the establishment payroll survey. The
payroll survey is based on a survey of about 147,000 businesses and
government agencies throughout the United States. It generates
payroll employment estimates by the following criteria: all
employees, average weekly hours worked, and average hourly, weekly,
and overtime earnings. One of the criticisms of this survey is that
it does not count the self-employed. It also does not make a
distinction between new, minimum wage, part time or temporary jobs
and full time jobs with “decent” pay.</p>
<p>How Does the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Collect the U.S.</p>
<p>Unemployment Data?</p>
<p>The unemployment rate announced by the U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics on the first Friday of each month for the previous month
is based on the Current Population Survey (CPS), which the Bureau
has carried out every month since 1940. The Bureau takes great care
to make this survey representative of the country as a whole. The
country is first divided into 3,137 areas. The U.S. Bureau of the
Census then selects 729 of these areas to survey. It divides the 729
areas into districts of about 300 households each, and divides each
district into clusters of about four dwelling units. Every month,
Census Bureau employees call about 15,000 of the four-household
clusters, for a total of 60,000 households. Employees interview
households for four consecutive months, then rotate them out of the
survey for eight months, and then interview them again for the same
four months the following year, before leaving the sample
permanently.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_189.png" width="624" height="51" alt="image" />
<p>What is the difference between CPS and EPS?</p>
<p>The United States Census Bureau conducts the Current Population
Survey (CPS), which measures the percentage of the labor force that
is unemployed. The Bureau of Labor Statistics’ establishment payroll
survey (EPS) is a payroll survey that measures the net change in
jobs created for the month.</p>
<p>Based on this survey, state, industry, urban and rural areas,
gender, age, race or ethnicity, and level of education statistics
comprise components that contribute to unemployment rates. A wide
variety of other information is available, too. For example, how
long have people been unemployed? Did they become unemployed because
they quit, or were laid off, or their employer went out of business?
Is the unemployed person the only wage earner in the family? The
Current Population Survey is a treasure trove of information about
employment and unemployment. If you are wondering what the
difference is between the CPS and EPS, read the following Clear it
Up feature.</p>
<p>Criticisms of Measuring Unemployment</p>
<p>There are always complications in measuring the number of
unemployed. For example, what about people who do not have jobs and
would be available to work, but are discouraged by the lack of
available jobs in their area and stopped looking? Such people, and
their families, may be suffering the pains of unemployment. However,
the survey counts them as out of the labor force because they are
not actively looking for work. Other people may tell the Census
Bureau that they are ready to work and looking for a job but, truly,
they are not that eager to work and are not looking very hard at
all. They are counted as unemployed, although they might more
accurately be classified as out of the labor force. Still other
people may have a job, perhaps doing something like yard work, child
care, or cleaning houses, but are not reporting the income earned to
the tax authorities. They may report being unemployed, when they
actually are working.</p>

frequently asked questions about employment and labor.</span></p>
<p>Although the unemployment rate gets most of the public and media
attention, economic researchers at the Bureau of Labor Statistics
publish a wide array of surveys and reports that try to measure
these kinds of issues and to develop a more nuanced and complete
view of the labor market. It is not exactly a hot news flash that
economic statistics are imperfect. Even imperfect measures like the
unemployment rate, however, can still be quite informative, when
interpreted knowledgeably and sensibly.</p>

<p>Let’s look at how unemployment rates have changed over time and how

<p>The Historical U.S. Unemployment Rate</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark630" class="a">Figure 8.3</a> <span
class="p">shows the historical pattern of U.S. unemployment
since 1955.</span></p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_192.jpg" width="365" height="243" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark630">Figure 8.3 The U.S. Unemployment Rate,
1955–2015</span> <span class="s37">The U.S. unemployment rate moves
up and down as the economy moves in and out of recessions. However,
over time, the unemployment rate seems to return to a range of 4% to
6%. There does not seem to be a long-term trend toward the rate
moving generally higher or generally lower. (Source: Federal Reserve
Economic Data (FRED)
<a class="reference external" href="https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/LRUN64TTUSA156S0">https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/LRUN64TTUSA156S0</a>)</span><span
id="bookmark631">‌</span></p>
<p>As we look at this data, several patterns stand out:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Unemployment rates do fluctuate over time. During the deep
recessions of the early 1980s and of 2007–2009, unemployment
reached roughly 10%. For comparison, during the 1930s Great
Depression, the unemployment rate reached almost 25% of the
labor force.</p></li>
<li><p>Unemployment rates in the late 1990s and into the mid-2000s were
rather low by historical standards. The unemployment rate was
below 5% from 1997 to 2000, and near 5% during almost all of
2006–2007, and 5% or slightly less from September 2015 through
January 2017 (the latest date for which data are available as of
this writing). The previous time unemployment had been less than
5% for three consecutive years was three</p>
<p>decades earlier, from 1968 to 1970.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The unemployment rate never falls all the way to zero. It almost
never seems to get below 3%—and it stays that low only for very
short periods. (We discuss reasons why this is the case later in
this chapter.)</p></li>
<li><p><span id="bookmark632">The timing of rises and falls in
unemployment matches fairly well with the timing of upswings and
downswings in the overall economy, except that unemployment
tends to lag changes in economic activity, and especially so
during upswings of the economy following a recession. During
periods of recession and depression, unemployment is high.
During periods of economic growth, unemployment tends to be
lower.</span><span id="bookmark633">‌</span></p></li>
<li><p>No significant upward or downward trend in unemployment rates is
apparent. This point is especially worth noting because the U.S.
population more than quadrupled from 76 million in 1900 to over
324 million by 2017. Moreover, a higher proportion of U.S.
adults are now in the paid workforce, because women have entered
the paid labor force in significant numbers in recent decades.
Women comprised 18% of the paid workforce in 1900 and nearly
half of the paid workforce in 2017. However, despite the
increased number of workers, as well as other economic events
like globalization and the continuous invention of new
technologies, the economy has provided jobs without causing any
long-term upward or downward trend in unemployment rates.</p>
<p>Unemployment Rates by Group</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark634" class="s34">Unemployment is not distributed evenly across the U.S. population.</a>
<a href="#bookmark634" class="a">Figure 8.4</a> <span
class="p">shows unemployment rates broken down in various ways:
by gender, age, and race/ethnicity.</span></p>

<p><span id="bookmark634">Figure 8.4 Unemployment Rate by
Demographic Group</span> <span class="s37">(a) By gender,
1972–2016. Unemployment rates for men used to be lower than
unemployment rates for women, but in recent decades, the two
rates have been very close, often– and especially during and
soon after the Great Recession – with the unemployment rate for
men somewhat higher. (b) By age, 1972–2016. Unemployment rates
are highest for the very young and become lower with age. (c) By
race and ethnicity, 1972–2016. Although unemployment rates for
all groups tend to rise and fall together, the unemployment rate
for blacks is typically about twice as high as that for whites,
while the unemployment rate for Hispanics is in between.

style=" color: #000;">for detailed information on the 2008–2009
recession. It also provides some very useful information on the
statistics of unemployment.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark634" class="s34">The unemployment rate for women had historically tended to be higher than the unemployment rate for men, perhaps reflecting the historical pattern that women were seen as “secondary” earners. By about 1980, however, the unemployment rate for women was essentially the same as that for men, as</a>
<a href="#bookmark634" class="a">Figure 8.4</a> <span
class="p">(a) shows. During the 2008-2009 recession and in the
immediate aftermath, the unemployment rate for men exceeded the
unemployment rate for women. Subsequently, however, the gap has
narrowed.</span></p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_195.png" width="624" height="160" alt="image" />
<p><a href="#bookmark634" class="s34">Younger workers tend to have higher unemployment, while middle-aged workers tend to have lower unemployment, probably because the middle-aged workers feel the responsibility of needing to have a job more heavily. Younger workers move in and out of jobs more than middle-aged workers, as part of the process of matching of workers and jobs, and this contributes to their higher unemployment rates. In addition, middle-aged workers are more likely to feel the responsibility of needing to have a job more heavily. Elderly workers have extremely low rates of unemployment, because those who do not have jobs often exit the labor force by retiring, and thus are not counted in the unemployment statistics.</a>
<a href="#bookmark634" class="a">Figure 8.4</a> <span
class="p">(b) shows unemployment rates for women divided by age.
The pattern for men is similar.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark634" class="s34">The unemployment rate for African-Americans is substantially higher than the rate for other racial or ethnic groups, a fact that surely reflects, to some extent, a pattern of discrimination that has constrained blacks’ labor market opportunities. However, the gaps between unemployment rates for whites and for blacks and Hispanics diminished in the 1990s, as</a>
<a href="#bookmark634" class="a">Figure</a> 8.4 <span
class="p">(c) shows. In fact, unemployment rates for blacks and
Hispanics were at the lowest levels for several decades in the
mid-2000s before rising during the recent Great
Recession.</span></p>
<p>Finally, those with less education typically suffer higher
unemployment. In January 2017, for example, the unemployment
rate for those with a college degree was 2.5%; for those with
some college but not a four year degree, the unemployment rate
was 3.8%; for high school graduates with no additional degree,
the unemployment rate was 5.3%; and for those without a high
school diploma, the unemployment rate was 7.7%. This pattern
arises because additional education typically offers better
connections to the labor market and higher demand. With less
attractive labor market opportunities for low-skilled workers
compared to the opportunities for the more highly- skilled,
including lower pay, low-skilled workers may be less motivated
to find jobs.</p>
<p>Breaking Down Unemployment in Other Ways</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark635" class="s34">The Bureau of Labor Statistics also gives information about the reasons for unemployment, as well as the length of time individuals have been unemployed.</a>

<p>Table 8.4 International Comparisons of Unemployment Rates</p>
<p>However, we need to treat cross-country comparisons of
unemployment rates with care, because each country has slightly
different definitions of unemployment, survey tools for
measuring unemployment, and also different labor markets. For
example, Japan’s unemployment rates appear quite low, but
Japan’s economy has been mired in slow growth and recession
since the late 1980s, and Japan’s unemployment rate probably
paints too rosy a picture of its</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_197.png" width="624" height="268" alt="image" />
<p><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/ChinaEmployment" class="s84">We hear about the Chinese economy in the news all the time. The value of the Chinese yuan in comparison to the U.S. dollar is likely to be part of the nightly business report, so why is the Chinese economy not included in this discussion of international unemployment? The lack of reliable statistics is the reason. This</a>
<a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/ChinaEmployment" class="s41">article (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/ChinaEmployment)</a>
<span style=" color: #000;">explains why.</span></p>
<p>labor market. In Japan, workers who lose their jobs are often
quick to exit the labor force and not look for a new job, in
which case they are not counted as unemployed. In addition,
Japanese firms are often quite reluctant to fire workers, and so
firms have substantial numbers of workers who are on reduced
hours or officially employed, but doing very little. We can view
this Japanese pattern as an unusual method for society to
provide support for the unemployed, rather than a sign of a
healthy economy.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark638">Comparing unemployment rates in the
United States and other high-income economies with unemployment
rates in Latin America, Africa, Eastern Europe, and Asia is very
difficult. One reason is that the statistical agencies in many
poorer countries lack the resources and technical capabilities
of the U.S. Bureau of the Census. However, a more difficult
problem with international comparisons is that in many
low-income countries, most workers are not involved in the labor
market through an employer who pays them regularly. Instead,
workers in these countries are engaged in short-term work,
subsistence activities, and barter. Moreover, the effect of
unemployment is very different in high-income and low-income
countries. Unemployed workers in the developed economies have
access to various government programs like unemployment
insurance, welfare, and food stamps. Such programs may barely
exist in poorer countries. Although unemployment is a serious
problem in many low-income countries, it manifests itself in a
different way than in high-income countries.</span></p>

style=" color: #3767B1;">What Causes Changes in Unemployment
over the Short Run</span><span id="bookmark639">‌</span></p>
<p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Analyze cyclical unemployment</p></li>
<li><p>Explain the relationship between sticky wages and
employment using various economic arguments</p></li>
<li><p>Apply supply and demand models to unemployment and wages</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We have seen that unemployment varies across times and
places. What causes changes in unemployment? There are
different answers in the short run and in the long run.
Let’s look at the short run first.</p>
<p>Cyclical Unemployment</p>
<p>Let’s make the plausible assumption that in the short run,
from a few months to a few years, the quantity of hours that
the average person is willing to work for a given wage does
not change much, so the labor supply curve does not shift
much. In addition, make the standard <em>ceteris paribus</em>
assumption that there is no substantial short-term change in
the age structure of the labor force, institutions and laws
affecting the labor market, or other possibly relevant
factors.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark640">One primary determinant of the demand
for labor from firms is how they perceive the state of the
macro economy. If firms believe that business is expanding,
then at any given wage they will desire to hire a greater
quantity of labor, and</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark641">the labor demand curve shifts to the
right. Conversely, if firms perceive that the economy is
slowing down or entering a recession, then they will wish to
hire a lower quantity of labor at any given wage, and the
labor demand curve will shift to the left. Economists call
the variation in unemployment that the economy causes moving
from expansion to recession or from recession to expansion
(i.e. the business cycle)</span> <strong>cyclical unemployment</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark643" id="bookmark642" class="s34">From the standpoint of the supply-and-demand model of competitive and flexible labor markets, unemployment represents something of a puzzle. In a supply-and-demand model of a labor market, as</a>
<a href="#bookmark643" class="a">Figure 8.5</a> <span

<p>One possibility for unemployment is that people who are
unemployed are those who are not willing to work at the
current equilibrium wage, say <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10 an hour, but would be
willing to work at a higher wage, like \)</span>20 per hour. The
monthly Current Population Survey would count these people
as unemployed, because they say they are ready and looking
for work (at $20 per hour). However, from an economist’s
perspective, these people are choosing to be unemployed.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark644">Probably a few people are unemployed
because of unrealistic expectations about wages, but they do
not represent the majority of the unemployed. Instead,
unemployed people often have friends or acquaintances of
similar skill levels who are employed, and the unemployed
would be willing to work at the jobs and wages similar to
what those people are receiving. However, the employers of
their friends and acquaintances do not seem to be hiring. In
other words, these people are involuntarily unemployed. What
causes involuntary unemployment?</span></p>
<p>Why Wages Might Be Sticky Downward</p>
<p>If a labor market model with flexible wages does not
describe unemployment very well—because it predicts that
anyone willing to work at the going wage can always find a
job—then it may prove useful to consider economic models in
which wages are not flexible or adjust only very slowly. In
particular, even though wage increases may occur with
relative ease, wage decreases are few and far between.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark645">One set of reasons why wages may be
“sticky downward,” as economists put it, involves economic
laws and institutions. For low-skilled workers receiving
minimum wage, it is illegal to reduce their wages. For union
workers operating under a multiyear contract with a company,
wage cuts might violate the contract and create a labor
dispute or a strike. However, minimum wages and union
contracts are not a sufficient reason why wages would be
sticky downward for the U.S. economy as a whole. After all,
out of the 150 million or so employed workers in the U.S.
economy, only about 2.6 million—less than 2% of the total—do
not receive compensation above the minimum wage. Similarly,
labor unions represent only about 11% of American wage and
salary workers. In other high-income countries, more workers
may have their wages determined by unions or the minimum
wage may be set at a level that applies to a larger share of
workers. However, for the United States, these two factors
combined affect only about 15% or less of the labor
force.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark646">Economists looking for reasons why
wages might be sticky downwards have focused on factors that
may characterize most labor relationships in the economy,
not just a few. Many have proposed a number of different
theories, but they share a common tone.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark647">One argument is that even employees
who are not union members often work under an</span>
<strong>implicit contract</strong>, which is that the employer will try
to keep wages from falling when the economy is weak or the
business is having trouble, and the employee will not expect
huge salary increases when the economy or the business is
strong. This wage-setting behavior acts like a form of
insurance: the employee has some protection against wage
declines in bad times, but pays for that protection with
lower wages in good times. Clearly, this sort of implicit
contract means that firms will be hesitant to cut wages,
lest workers feel betrayed and work less hard or even leave
the firm.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark648">Efficiency wage theory</span> <span
class="p">argues that workers’ productivity depends on their
pay, and so employers will often find it worthwhile to pay
their employees somewhat more than market conditions might
dictate. One reason is that employees who receive better pay
than others will be more productive because they recognize
that if they were to lose their current jobs, they would
suffer a decline in salary. As a result, they are motivated
to work harder and to stay with the current employer. In
addition, employers know that it is costly and
time-consuming to hire and train new employees, so they
would prefer to pay workers a little extra now rather than
to lose them and have to hire and train new workers. Thus,
by avoiding wage cuts, the employer minimizes costs of
training and hiring new workers, and reaps the benefits of
well-motivated employees.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark649">The</span> <strong>adverse selection of
wage cuts argument</strong> points out that if an employer reacts
to poor business conditions by reducing wages for all
workers, then the best workers, those with the best
employment alternatives at other firms, are the most likely
to leave. The least attractive workers, with fewer
employment alternatives, are more likely to stay.
Consequently, firms are more likely to choose which workers
should depart, through layoffs and firings, rather than
trimming wages across the board. Sometimes companies that
are experiencing difficult times can persuade workers to
take a pay cut for the short term, and still retain most of
the firm’s workers. However, it is far more typical for
companies to lay off some workers, rather than to cut wages
for everyone.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark650">The</span> <strong>insider-outsider model</strong>
of the labor force, in simple terms, argues that those
already working for firms are “insiders,” while new
employees, at least for a time, are “outsiders.” A firm
depends on its insiders to keep the organization running
smoothly, to be familiar with routine procedures, and to
train new employees. However, cutting wages will alienate
the insiders and damage the firm’s productivity and
prospects.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark651">Finally, the</span> <strong>relative wage
coordination argument</strong> points out that even if most workers
were hypothetically willing to see a decline in their own
wages in bad economic times as long as everyone else also
experiences such a decline, there is no obvious way for a
decentralized economy to implement such a plan. Instead,
workers confronted with the possibility of a wage cut will
worry that other workers will not have such a wage cut, and
so a wage cut means being worse off both in absolute terms
and relative to others. As a result, workers fight hard
against wage cuts.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark652" class="s34">These theories of why wages tend not to move downward differ in their logic and their implications, and figuring out the strengths and weaknesses of each theory is an ongoing subject of research and controversy among economists. All tend to imply that wages will decline only very slowly, if at all, even when the economy or a business is having tough times. When wages are inflexible and unlikely to fall, then either short-run or long-run unemployment can result.</a>

</ul>
<p><span id="bookmark655">Cyclical unemployment explains why
unemployment rises during a recession and falls during an
economic expansion, but what explains the remaining level of
unemployment even in good economic times? Why is the
unemployment rate never zero? Even when the U.S. economy is
growing strongly, the unemployment rate only rarely dips as
low as 4%. Moreover, the discussion earlier in this chapter
pointed out that unemployment rates in many European
countries like Italy, France, and Germany have often been
remarkably high at various times in the last few decades.
Why does some level of unemployment persist even when
economies are growing strongly? Why are unemployment rates
continually higher in certain economies, through good
economic years and bad? Economists have a term to describe
the remaining level of unemployment that occurs even when
the economy is healthy: they call it the</span> <strong>natural
rate of unemployment</strong>.</p>
<p>The Long Run: The Natural Rate of Unemployment</p>
<p>The natural rate of unemployment is not “natural” in the
sense that water freezes at 32 degrees Fahrenheit or boils
at 212 degrees Fahrenheit. It is not a physical and
unchanging law of nature. Instead, it is only the “natural”
rate because it is the unemployment rate that would result
from the combination of economic, social, and political
factors that exist at a time—assuming the economy was
neither booming nor in recession. These forces include the
usual pattern of companies expanding and contracting their
workforces in a dynamic economy, social and economic forces
that affect the labor market, or public policies that affect
either the eagerness of people to work or the willingness of
businesses to hire. Let’s discuss these factors in more
detail.</p>
<p>Frictional Unemployment</p>
<p><span id="bookmark656">In a market economy, some companies
are always going broke for a variety of reasons: old
technology; poor management; good management that happened
to make bad decisions; shifts in tastes of consumers so that
less of the firm’s product is desired; a large customer who
went broke; or tough domestic or foreign competitors.
Conversely, other companies will be doing very well for just
the opposite reasons and looking to hire more employees. In
a perfect world, all of those who lost jobs would
immediately find new ones. However, in the real world, even
if the number of job seekers is equal to the number of job
vacancies, it takes time to find out about new jobs, to
interview and figure out if the new job is a good match, or
perhaps to sell a house and buy another in proximity to a
new job. Economists call the unemployment that occurs in the
meantime, as workers move between jobs,</span> <strong>frictional
unemployment</strong>. Frictional unemployment is not inherently a
bad thing. It takes time on part of both the employer and
the individual to match those looking for employment with
the correct job openings. For individuals and companies to
be successful and productive, you want people to find the
job for which they are best suited, not just the first job
offered.<span id="bookmark657">‌</span></p>
<p>In the mid-2000s, before the 2008–2009 recession, it was
true that about 7% of U.S. workers saw their jobs disappear
in any three-month period. However, in periods of economic
growth, these destroyed jobs are counterbalanced for the
economy as a whole by a larger number of jobs created. In
2005, for example, there were typically about 7.5 million
unemployed people at any given time in the U.S. economy.
Even though about two-thirds of those unemployed people
found a job in 14 weeks or fewer, the unemployment rate did
not change much during the year, because those who found new
jobs were largely offset by others who lost jobs.</p>
<p>Of course, it would be preferable if people who were losing
jobs could immediately and easily move into newly created
jobs, but in the real world, that is not possible. Someone
who is laid off by a textile mill in South Carolina cannot
turn around and immediately start working for a textile mill
in California. Instead, the adjustment process happens in
ripples. Some people find new jobs near their old ones,
while others find that they must move to new locations. Some
people can do a very similar job with a different company,
while others must start new career paths. Some people may be
near retirement and decide to look only for part-time work,
while others want an employer that offers a long-term career
path. The frictional unemployment that results from people
moving between jobs in a dynamic economy may account for one
to two percentage points of total unemployment.</p>
<p>The level of frictional unemployment will depend on how easy
it is for workers to learn about alternative jobs, which may
reflect the ease of communications about job prospects in
the economy. The extent of frictional unemployment will also
depend to some extent on how willing people are to move to
new areas to find jobs—which in turn may depend on history
and culture.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark634" class="s34">Frictional unemployment and the natural rate of unemployment also seem to depend on the age distribution of the population.</a>
<a href="#bookmark634" class="a">Figure 8.4</a> <span
class="p">(b) showed that unemployment rates are typically
lower for people between 25–54 years of age or aged 55 and
over than they are for those who are younger. “Prime-age
workers,” as those in the 25–54 age bracket are sometimes
called, are typically at a place in their lives when they
want to have a job and income arriving at all times. In
addition, older workers who lose jobs may prefer to opt for
retirement. By contrast, it is likely that a relatively high
proportion of those who are under 25 will be trying out jobs
and life options, and this leads to greater job mobility and
hence higher frictional unemployment. Thus, a society with a
relatively high proportion of young workers, like the U.S.
beginning in the mid-1960s when Baby Boomers began entering
the labor market, will tend to have a higher unemployment
rate than a society with a higher proportion of its workers
in older ages.</span></p>
<p>Structural Unemployment</p>
<p><span id="bookmark658">Another factor that influences the
natural rate of unemployment is the amount of</span>
<strong>structural unemployment</strong>. The structurally unemployed are
individuals who have no jobs because they lack skills valued
by the labor market, either because demand has shifted away
from the skills they do have, or because they never learned
any skills. An example of the former would be the
unemployment among aerospace engineers after the U.S. space
program downsized in the 1970s. An example of the latter
would be high school dropouts.</p>
<p>Some people worry that technology causes structural
unemployment. In the past, new technologies have put lower
skilled employees out of work, but at the same time they
create demand for higher skilled workers to use the new
technologies. Education seems to be the key in minimizing
the amount of structural unemployment. Individuals who have
degrees can be retrained if they become structurally
unemployed. For people with no skills and little education,
that option is more limited.</p>
<p>Natural Unemployment and Potential Real GDP</p>
<p>The natural unemployment rate is related to two other
important concepts: full employment and potential real GDP.
Economists consider the economy to be at full employment
when the actual unemployment rate is equal to the natural
unemployment rate. When the economy is at full employment,
real GDP is equal to potential real GDP. By contrast, when
the economy is below full employment, the unemployment rate
is greater than the natural unemployment rate and real GDP
is less than potential. Finally, when the economy is above
full employment, then the unemployment rate is less than the
natural unemployment rate and real GDP is greater than
potential. Operating above potential is only possible for a
short while, since it is analogous to all workers working
overtime.</p>
<p>Productivity Shifts and the Natural Rate of Unemployment</p>
<p>Unexpected shifts in productivity can have a powerful effect
on the natural rate of unemployment. Over time, workers’
productivity determines the level of wages in an economy.
After all, if a business paid workers more than could be
justified by their productivity, the business will
ultimately lose money and go bankrupt. Conversely, if a
business tries to pay workers less than their productivity
then, in a competitive labor market, other businesses will
find it worthwhile to hire away those workers and pay them
more.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark659">However, adjustments of wages to
productivity levels will not happen quickly or smoothly.
Employers typically review wages only once or twice a year.
In many modern jobs, it is difficult to measure productivity
at the individual level. For example, how precisely would
one measure the quantity produced by an accountant who is
one of many people working in the tax department of a large
corporation? Because productivity is difficult to observe,
employers often determine wage increases based on recent
experience with productivity. If productivity has been
rising at, say, 2% per year, then wages rise at that level
as well. However, when productivity changes unexpectedly, it
can affect the natural rate of unemployment for a
time.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark537" class="s34">The U.S. economy in the 1970s and 1990s provides two vivid examples of this process. In the 1970s, productivity growth slowed down unexpectedly (as we discussed in</a>
<a href="#bookmark537" class="a">Economic</a> <span
class="s54">Growth</span><a href="#bookmark660" class="s34">). For example, output per hour of U.S. workers in the business sector increased at an annual rate of 3.3% per year from 1960 to 1973, but only 0.8% from 1973 to 1982.</a>
<a href="#bookmark660" class="a">Figure</a> <span
class="s54">8.8 </span>(a) illustrates the situation where
the demand for labor—that is, the quantity of labor that
business is willing to hire at any given wage—has been
shifting out a little each year because of rising
productivity, from D<span class="s60">0</span> to D<span
class="s60">1</span> to D<span class="s60">2</span>. As a
result, equilibrium wages have been rising each year from
W<span class="s60">0</span> to W<span class="s60">1</span>
to W<span class="s60">2</span>. However, when productivity
unexpectedly slows down, the pattern of wage increases does
not adjust right away. Wages keep rising each year from
W<span class="s60">2</span> to W<span class="s60">3</span>
to W<span class="s60">4</span>, but the demand for labor is
no longer shifting up. A gap opens where the quantity of
labor supplied at wage level W<span class="s60">4</span> is
greater than the quantity demanded. The natural rate of
unemployment rises. In the aftermath of this unexpectedly
low productivity in the 1970s, the national unemployment
rate did not fall below 7% from May, 1980 until 1986. Over
time, the rise in wages will adjust to match the slower
gains in productivity, and the unemployment rate will ease
back down, but this process may take years.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_202.jpg" width="493" height="262" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark660"><span class="s36">Figure 8.8
Unexpected Productivity Changes and Unemployment
</span></span>(a) Productivity is rising, increasing the
demand for labor. Employers and workers become used to the
pattern of wage increases. Then productivity suddenly stops
increasing. However, the expectations of employers and
workers for wage increases do not shift immediately, so
wages keep rising as before. However, the demand for labor
has not increased, so at wage W<span class="s63">4</span>,
unemployment exists where the quantity supplied of labor
exceeds the quantity demanded. (b) The rate of productivity
increase has been zero for a time, so employers and workers
have come to accept the equilibrium wage level (W). Then
productivity increases unexpectedly, shifting demand for
labor from D<span class="s63">0</span> to D<span
class="s63">1</span>. At the wage (W), this means that the
quantity demanded of labor exceeds the quantity supplied,
and with job offers plentiful, the unemployment rate will be
low.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark660" class="s34">The late 1990s provide an opposite example: instead of the surprise decline in productivity that occurred in the 1970s, productivity unexpectedly rose in the mid-1990s. The annual growth rate of real output per hour of labor increased from 1.7% from 1980–1995, to an annual rate of 2.6% from 1995–2001. Let’s simplify the situation a bit, so that the economic lesson of the story is easier to see graphically, and say that productivity had not been increasing at all in earlier years, so the intersection of the labor market was at point E in</a>
<a href="#bookmark660" class="a">Figure 8.8</a><span
class="s54"> </span>(b), where the demand curve for labor
(D<span class="s60">0</span>) intersects the supply curve
for labor. As a result, real wages were not increasing. Now,
productivity jumps upward, which shifts the demand for labor
out to the right, from D<span class="s60">0</span> to D<span
class="s60">1</span>. At least for a time, however, wages
are still set according to the earlier expectations of no
productivity growth, so wages do not rise. The result is
that at the prevailing wage level (W), the quantity of labor
demanded (Qd) will for a time exceed the quantity of labor
supplied (Qs), and unemployment will be very low—actually
below the natural level of unemployment for a time. This
pattern of unexpectedly high productivity helps to explain
why the unemployment rate stayed below 4.5%—quite a low
level by historical standards—from 1998 until after the U.S.
economy had entered a recession in 2001.</p>
<p>Levels of unemployment will tend to be somewhat higher on
average when productivity is unexpectedly low, and
conversely, will tend to be somewhat lower on average when
productivity is unexpectedly high. However, over time, wages
do eventually adjust to reflect productivity levels.</p>
<p>Public Policy and the Natural Rate of Unemployment</p>
<p>Public policy can also have a powerful effect on the natural
rate of unemployment. On the supply side of the labor
market, public policies to assist the unemployed can affect
how eager people are to find work. For example, if a worker
who loses a job is guaranteed a generous package of
unemployment insurance, welfare benefits, food stamps, and
government medical benefits, then the opportunity cost of
unemployment is lower and that worker will be less eager to
seek a new job.</p>
<p>What seems to matter most is not just the amount of these
benefits, but how long they last. A society that provides
generous help for the unemployed that cuts off after, say,
six months, may provide less of an incentive for
unemployment than a society that provides less generous help
that lasts for several years. Conversely, government
assistance for job search or retraining can in some cases
encourage people back to work sooner. See the Clear it Up to
learn how the U.S. handles unemployment insurance.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_203.png" width="624" height="740" alt="image" />
<p>How does U.S. unemployment insurance work?</p>
<p>Unemployment insurance is a joint federal–state program that
the federal government enacted in 1935. While the federal
government sets minimum standards for the program, state
governments conduct most of the administration.</p>
<p>The funding for the program is a federal tax collected from
employers. The federal government requires tax collection on
the first $7,000 in wages paid to each worker; however,
states can choose to collect the tax on a higher amount if
they wish, and 41 states have set a higher limit. States can
choose the length of time that they pay benefits, although
most states limit unemployment benefits to 26 weeks—with
extensions possible in times of especially high
unemployment. The states then use the fund to pay benefits
to those who become unemployed. Average unemployment
benefits are equal to about one-third of the wage that the
person earned in his or her previous job, but the level of
unemployment benefits varies considerably across states.</p>

<span style=" color: #000;">for an explanation of exactly
who is eligible for unemployment benefits.</span></p>
<p>One other interesting thing to note about the
classifications of unemployment—an individual does not have
to collect unemployment benefits to be classified as
unemployed. While there are statistics kept and studied
relating to how many people are collecting unemployment
insurance, this is not the source of unemployment rate
information.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_205.png" width="624" height="160" alt="image" />
<p>On the demand side of the labor market, government rules,
social institutions, and the presence of unions can affect
the willingness of firms to hire. For example, if a
government makes it hard for businesses to start up or to
expand, by wrapping new businesses in bureaucratic red tape,
then businesses will become more discouraged about hiring.
Government regulations can make it harder to start a
business by requiring that a new business obtain many
permits and pay many fees, or by restricting the types and
quality of products that a company can sell. Other
government regulations, like zoning laws, may limit where
companies can conduct business, or whether businesses are
allowed to be open during evenings or on Sunday.</p>
<p>Whatever defenses may be offered for such laws in terms of
social value—like the value some Christians place on not
working on Sunday, or Orthodox Jews or highly observant
Muslims on Saturday—these kinds of restrictions impose a
barrier between some willing workers and other willing
employers, and thus contribute to a higher natural rate of
unemployment. Similarly, if government makes it difficult to
fire or lay off workers, businesses may react by trying not
to hire more workers than strictly necessary—since laying
these workers off would be costly and difficult. High
minimum wages may discourage businesses from hiring
low-skill workers. Government rules may encourage and
support powerful unions, which can then push up wages for
union workers, but at a cost of discouraging businesses from
hiring those workers.</p>
<p>The Natural Rate of Unemployment in Recent Years</p>
<p>The underlying economic, social, and political factors that
determine the natural rate of unemployment can change over
time, which means that the natural rate of unemployment can
change over time, too.</p>
<p>Estimates by economists of the natural rate of unemployment
in the U.S. economy in the early 2000s run at about 4.5 to
5.5%. This is a lower estimate than earlier. We outline
three of the common reasons that economists propose for this
change below.</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>The internet has provided a remarkable new tool through
which job seekers can find out about jobs at different
companies and can make contact with relative ease. An
internet search is far easier than trying to find a list
of local employers and then hunting up phone numbers for
all of their human resources departments, and requesting
a list of jobs and application forms. Social networking
sites such as LinkedIn have changed how people find work
as well.</p></li>
<li><p>The growth of the temporary worker industry has probably
helped to reduce the natural rate of unemployment. In
the early 1980s, only about 0.5% of all workers held
jobs through temp agencies. By the early 2000s, the
figure had risen above 2%. Temp agencies can provide
jobs for workers while they are looking for permanent
work. They can also serve as a clearinghouse, helping
workers find out about jobs with certain employers and
getting a tryout with the employer. For many workers, a
temp job is a stepping-stone to a permanent job that
they might not have heard about or obtained any other
way, so the growth of temp jobs will also tend to reduce
frictional unemployment.</p></li>
<li><p>The aging of the “baby boom generation”—the especially
large generation of Americans born between 1946 and
1964—meant that the proportion of young workers in the
economy was relatively high in the 1970s, as the boomers
entered the labor market, but is relatively low today.
As we noted earlier, middle-aged and older workers are
far more likely to experience low unemployment than
younger workers, a factor that tends to reduce the
natural rate of unemployment as the baby boomers age.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The combined result of these factors is that the natural rate of
unemployment was on average lower in the 1990s and the early 2000s
than in the 1980s. The 2008–2009 Great Recession pushed monthly
unemployment rates up to 10% in late 2009. However, even at that
time, the Congressional Budget Office was forecasting that by 2015,
unemployment</p>
<p>rates would fall back to about 5%. During the last four months of
2015 the unemployment rate held steady at 5.0%. Throughout 2016 and
up through January 2017, the unemployment rate has remained at or
slightly below 5%. As of the first quarter of 2017, the
Congressional Budget Office estimates the natural rate to be 4.74%,
and the measured unemployment rate for January 2017 is 4.8%.</p>
<p>The Natural Rate of Unemployment in Europe</p>
<p>By the standards of other high-income economies, the natural rate of
unemployment in the U.S. economy appears relatively low. Through
good economic years and bad, many European economies have had
unemployment rates hovering near 10%, or even higher, since the
1970s. European rates of unemployment have been higher not because
recessions in Europe have been deeper, but rather because the
conditions underlying supply and demand for labor have been
different in Europe, in a way that has created a much higher natural
rate of unemployment.</p>
<p>Many European countries have a combination of generous welfare and
unemployment benefits, together with nests of rules that impose
additional costs on businesses when they hire. In addition, many
countries have laws that require firms to give workers months of
notice before laying them off and to provide substantial severance
or retraining packages after laying them off. The legally required
notice before laying off a worker can be more than three months in
Spain, Germany, Denmark, and Belgium, and the legally required
severance package can be as high as a year’s salary or more in
Austria, Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Greece. Such laws will surely
discourage laying off or firing current workers. However, when
companies know that it will be difficult to fire or lay off workers,
they also become hesitant about hiring in the first place.</p>
<p>We can attribute the typically higher levels of unemployment in many
European countries in recent years, which have prevailed even when
economies are growing at a solid pace, to the fact that the sorts of
laws and regulations that lead to a high natural rate of
unemployment are much more prevalent in Europe than in the United
States.</p>
<p>A Preview of Policies to Fight Unemployment</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1384" class="s34">The</a>
<a href="#bookmark1384" class="a">Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy</a>
<a href="#bookmark1530" class="s34">and</a>
<a href="#bookmark1530" class="a">Macroeconomic Policy Around the World</a>
<span class="p">chapters provide a detailed discussion of how to
fight unemployment, when we can discuss these policies in the
context of the full array of macroeconomic goals and frameworks for
analysis. However, even at this preliminary stage, it is useful to
preview the main issues concerning policies to fight
unemployment.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1384" class="s34">The remedy for unemployment will depend on the diagnosis. Cyclical unemployment is a short-term problem, caused because the economy is in a recession. Thus, the preferred solution will be to avoid or minimize recessions. As</a>
<a href="#bookmark1384" class="a">Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy</a>
<span class="p">discusses, governments can enact this policy by
stimulating the overall buying power in the economy, so that firms
perceive that sales and profits are possible, which makes them eager
to hire.</span></p>
<p>Dealing with the natural rate of unemployment is trickier. In a
market-oriented economy, firms will hire and fire workers.
Governments cannot control this. Furthermore, the evolving age
structure of the economy’s population, or unexpected shifts in
productivity are beyond a government’s control and, will affect the
natural rate of unemployment for a time. However, as the example of
high ongoing unemployment rates for many European countries
illustrates, government policy clearly can affect the natural rate
of unemployment that will persist even when GDP is growing.</p>
<p>When a government enacts policies that will affect workers or
employers, it must examine how these policies will affect the
information and incentives employees and employers have to find one
another. For example, the government may have a role to play in
helping some of the unemployed with job searches. Governments may
need to rethink the design of their programs that offer assistance
to unemployed workers and protections to employed workers so that
they will not unduly discourage the supply of labor. Similarly,
governments may need to reassess rules that make it difficult for
businesses to begin or to expand so that they will not unduly
discourage the demand for labor. The message is not that governments
should repeal all laws affecting labor markets, but only that when
they enact such laws, a society that cares about unemployment will
need to consider the tradeoffs involved.</p>

<p>Unemployment and the Great Recession</p>
<p>In the review of unemployment during and after the Great Recession
at the outset of this chapter, we noted that unemployment tends to
be a lagging indicator of business activity. This has historically
been the case, and it is evident for all recessions that have taken
place since the end of World War II. In brief, this results from the
costs to employers of recruitment, hiring, and training workers.
Those costs represent investments by firms in their work forces.</p>
<p>At the outset of a recession, when a firm realizes that demand for
its product or service is not as strong as anticipated, it has an
incentive to lay off workers. However, doing so runs the risk of
losing those workers, and if the weak demand proves to be only
temporary, the firm will be obliged to recruit, hire, and train new
workers. Thus, firms tend to retain workers initially in a downturn.
Similarly, as business begins to pick up when a recession is over,
firms are not sure if the improvement will last. Rather than incur
the costs of hiring and training new workers, they will wait, and
perhaps resort to overtime work for existing workers, until they are
confident that the recession is over.</p>
<p>Another point that we noted at the outset is that the duration of
recoveries in employment following recessions has been longer
following the last three recessions (going back to the early 1990s)
than previously. Nir Jaimovich and Henry Siu have argued that these
“jobless recoveries” are a consequence of job polarization</p>
<p>– the disappearance of employment opportunities focused on “routine”
tasks. Job polarization refers to the increasing concentration of
employment in the highest- and lowest-wage occupations, as jobs in
middle-skill occupations disappear. Job polarization is an outcome
of technological progress in robotics, computing, and information
and communication technology. The result of this progress is a
decline in demand for labor in occupations that perform “routine”
tasks – tasks that are limited in scope and can be performed by
following a well-defined set of procedures – and hence a decline in
the share of total employment that is composed of routine
occupations. Jaimovich and Siu have shown that job polarization
characterizes the aftermath of the last three recessions, and this
appears to be responsible for the jobless recoveries.</p>

<p>KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY</p>
<ol>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark621" class="a">How Economists Define and Compute Unemployment</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark621">Rate</a></p>
<p>Unemployment imposes high costs. Unemployed individuals suffer
from loss of income and from stress. An economy with high
unemployment suffers an opportunity cost of unused resources. We
can divide the adult population into those in the labor force
and those out of the labor force. In turn, we divide those in
the labor force into employed and unemployed. A person without a
job must be willing and able to work and actively looking for
work to be counted as unemployed; otherwise, a person without a
job is counted as out of the labor force. Economists define the
unemployment rate as the number of unemployed persons divided by
the number of persons in the labor force (not the overall adult
population). The Current Population Survey (CPS) conducted by
the United States Census Bureau measures the percentage of the
labor force that is unemployed. The establishment payroll survey
by the Bureau of Labor Statistics measures the net change in
jobs created for the month.</p>

<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark629">Unemployment</a></p>
<p>The U.S. unemployment rate rises during periods of recession and
depression, but falls back to the range of 4% to</p>
<p>6% when the economy is strong. The unemployment rate never falls
to zero. Despite enormous growth in the size of the U.S.
population and labor force in the twentieth century, along with
other major trends like globalization and new technology, the
unemployment rate shows no long-term rising trend.</p>
<p>Unemployment rates differ by group: higher for African-Americans
and Hispanics than for whites; higher for less educated than
more educated; higher for the young than the middle-aged.
Women’s unemployment rates used to be higher than men’s, but in
recent years men’s and women’s unemployment rates have been very
similar. In recent years, unemployment rates in the United
States have compared favorably with unemployment rates in most
other high-income economies.</p>

<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark639">Run</a></p>
<p>Cyclical unemployment rises and falls with the business cycle.
In a labor market with flexible wages, wages will adjust in such
a market so that quantity demanded of labor always equals the
quantity supplied of labor at the equilibrium wage. Economists
have proposed many theories for why wages might not be flexible,
but instead may adjust only in a “sticky” way, especially when
it comes to downward adjustments: implicit contracts, efficiency
wage theory, adverse selection of wage cuts, insider-outsider
model, and relative wage coordination.</p>

<p>The natural rate of unemployment is the rate of unemployment that the
economic, social, and political forces in the economy would cause even
when the economy is not in a recession. These factors include the
frictional unemployment that occurs when people either choose to change
jobs or are put out of work for a time by the shifts of a dynamic and
changing economy. They also include any laws concerning conditions of
hiring and firing that have the undesired side effect of discouraging
job formation. They also include structural unemployment, which occurs
when demand shifts permanently away from a certain type of job skill.</p>

<p>CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Using the definition of the unemployment rate, is an increase in the
unemployment rate necessarily a bad thing for a nation?</p></li>
<li><p>Is a decrease in the unemployment rate necessarily a good thing for
a nation? Explain.</p></li>
<li><p>If many workers become discouraged from looking for jobs, explain
how the number of jobs could decline but the unemployment rate could
fall at the same time.</p></li>
<li><p>Would you expect hidden unemployment to be higher, lower, or about
the same when the unemployment rate is high, say 10%, versus low,
say 4%? Explain.</p></li>
<li><p>Is the higher unemployment rates for minority workers necessarily an
indication of discrimination? What could be some other reasons for
the higher unemployment rate?</p></li>
<li><p>While unemployment is highly negatively correlated with the level of
economic activity, in the real world it responds with a lag. In
other words, firms do not immediately lay off workers in response to
a sales decline. They wait a while before responding. Similarly,
firms do not immediately hire workers when sales pick up. What do
you think accounts for the lag in response time?</p></li>
<li><p>Why do you think that unemployment rates are lower for individuals
with more education?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you think it is rational for workers to prefer sticky wages to
wage cuts, when the consequence of sticky wages is unemployment for
some workers? Why or why not? How do the reasons for sticky wages
explained in this section apply to your argument?</p></li>
<li><p>Under what condition would a decrease in unemployment be bad for the
economy?</p></li>
<li><p>Under what condition would an increase in the unemployment rate be a
positive sign?</p></li>
<li><p>As the baby boom generation retires, the ratio of retirees to
workers will increase noticeably. How will this affect the Social
Security program? How will this affect the standard of living of the
average American?</p></li>
<li><p>Unemployment rates have been higher in many European countries in
recent decades than in the United States. Is the main reason for
this long-term difference in unemployment rates more likely to be
cyclical unemployment or the natural rate of unemployment? Explain
briefly.</p></li>
<li><p>Is it desirable to pursue a goal of zero unemployment? Why or why
not?</p></li>
<li><p>Is it desirable to eliminate natural unemployment? Why or why not?
<em>Hint</em>: Think about what our economy would look like today and what
assumptions would have to be met to have a zero rate of natural
unemployment.</p></li>
<li><p>The U.S. unemployment rate increased from 4.6% in July 2001 to 5.9%
by June 2002. Without studying the subject in any detail, would you
expect that a change of this kind is more likely to be due to
cyclical unemployment or a change in the natural rate of
unemployment? Why?</p>
<p>PROBLEMS</p>
</li>
<li><p>A country with a population of eight million adults has five million
employed, 500,000 unemployed, and the rest of the adult population
is out of the labor force. What’s the unemployment rate? What share
of population is in the labor force? Sketch a pie chart that divides
the adult population into these three groups.</p></li>
<li><p>A government passes a family-friendly law that no companies can have
evening, nighttime, or weekend hours, so that everyone can be home
with their families during these times. Analyze the effect of this
law using a demand and supply diagram for the labor market: first
assuming that wages are flexible, and then assuming that wages are
sticky downward.</p></li>

<p>A $550 Million Loaf of Bread?</p>
<p>If you were born within the last three decades in the United States,
Canada, or many other countries in the developed world, you probably
have no real experience with a high rate of inflation. Inflation is when
most prices in an entire economy are rising. However, there is an
extreme form of inflation called hyperinflation. This occurred in
Germany between 1921 and 1928, and more recently in Zimbabwe between
2008 and 2009. In November 2008, Zimbabwe had an inflation rate of 79.6
billion percent. In contrast, in 2014, the United States had an average
annual rate of inflation of 1.6%.</p>
<p>Zimbabwe’s inflation rate was so high it is difficult to comprehend, so
let’s put it into context. It is equivalent to price increases of 98%
per day. This means that, from one day to the next, prices essentially
double. What is life like in an economy afflicted with hyperinflation?
Most of you reading this will have never experienced this phenomenon.
The government adjusted prices for commodities in Zimbabwean dollars
several times <em>each day</em>. There was no desire to hold on to currency
since it lost value by the minute. The people there spent a great deal
of time getting rid of any cash they acquired by purchasing whatever
food or other commodities they could find. At one point, a loaf of bread
cost 550 million Zimbabwean dollars. Teachers’ salaries were in the
trillions a month; however, this was equivalent to only one U.S. dollar
a day. At its height, it took 621,984,228 Zimbabwean dollars to purchase
one U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>Government agencies had no money to pay their workers so they started
printing money to pay their bills rather than raising taxes. Rising
prices caused the government to enact price controls on private
businesses, which led to shortages and the emergence of black markets.
In 2009, the country abandoned its currency and allowed people to use
foreign currencies for purchases.</p>
<p>How does this happen? How can both government and the economy fail to
function at the most basic level? Before we consider these extreme cases
of hyperinflation, let’s first look at inflation itself.</p>

<h2>Introduction to Inflation<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-to-inflation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In this chapter, you will learn about:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Tracking Inflation</p></li>
<li><p>How to Measure Changes in the Cost of Living</p></li>
<li><p>How the U.S. and Other Countries Experience Inflation</p></li>
<li><p>The Confusion Over Inflation</p></li>
<li><p>Indexing and Its Limitations</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span id="bookmark691">Inflation</span> <span class="p">is a general and
ongoing rise in the level of prices in an entire economy. Inflation does
not refer to a change in relative prices. A relative price change occurs
when you see that the price of tuition has risen, but the price of
laptops has fallen. Inflation, on the other hand, means that there is
pressure for prices to rise in most markets in the economy. In addition,
price increases in the supply-and-demand model were one-time events,
representing a shift from a previous equilibrium to a new one. Inflation
implies an ongoing rise in prices. If inflation happened for one year
and then stopped, then it would not be inflation any more.</span></p>
<p>This chapter begins by showing how to combine prices of individual goods
and services to create a measure of overall inflation. It discusses the
historical and recent experience of inflation, both in the United States
and in other countries around the world. Other chapters have sometimes
included a note under an exhibit or a parenthetical reminder in the text
saying that the numbers have been adjusted for inflation. In this
chapter, it is time to show how to use inflation statistics to adjust
other economic variables, so that you can tell how much of, for example,
we can attribute the rise in GDP over different periods of time to an
actual increase in the production of goods and services and how much we
should attribute to the fact that prices for most items have risen.</p>
<p>Inflation has consequences for people and firms throughout the economy,
in their roles as lenders and borrowers, wage-earners, taxpayers, and
consumers. The chapter concludes with a discussion of some imperfections
and biases in the inflation statistics, and a preview of policies for
fighting inflation that we will discuss in other chapters.</p>

<p><a href="#bookmark693" class="s34">Dinner table conversations where you might have heard about inflation usually entail reminiscing about when “everything seemed to cost so much less.

<a href="#bookmark693" class="a">Table 9.1</a>
<a href="#bookmark693" class="s34">compares some prices of common goods in 1970 and 2017. Of course, the average prices in this table may not reflect the prices where you live. The cost of living in New York City is much higher than in Houston, Texas, for example. In addition, certain products have evolved over recent decades. A new car in 2017, loaded with antipollution equipment, safety gear, computerized engine controls, and many other technological advances, is a more advanced machine (and more fuel efficient) than your typical 1970s car. However, put details like these to one side for the moment, and look at the overall pattern. The primary reason behind the price rises in</a>
<a href="#bookmark693" class="a">Table</a> 9.1<span class="p">—and
all the price increases for the other products in the economy—is not
specific to the market for housing or cars or gasoline or movie
tickets. Instead, it is part of a general rise in the level of all
prices. At the beginning of 2017, $1 had about the same purchasing
power in overall terms of goods and services as 18 cents did
in</span></p>

<a href="#bookmark693" class="a">Table 9.1</a> <span class="p">shows
that the average hourly wage for a manufacturing worker increased
nearly six-fold from 1970 to 2017. The average worker in 2017 is
better educated and more productive than the average worker in
1970—but not six times more productive. Per capita GDP increased
substantially from 1970 to 2017, but is the average person in the
U.S. economy really more than eleven times better off in just 47
years? Not likely.</span><span id="bookmark695">‌</span></p>
<p>A modern economy has millions of goods and services whose prices are
continually quivering in the breezes of supply and demand. How can
all of these shifts in price attribute to a single inflation rate?
As with many problems in economic measurement, the conceptual answer
is reasonably straightforward: Economists combine prices of a
variety of goods and services into a single price level. The
inflation rate is simply the percentage change in the price level.
Applying the concept, however, involves some practical difficulties.</p>
<p>The Price of a Basket of Goods</p>
<p><span id="bookmark696">To calculate the price level, economists
begin with the concept of a</span> <strong>basket of goods and services</strong>,
consisting of the different items individuals, businesses, or
organizations typically buy. The next step is to look at how the
prices of those items change over time. In thinking about how to
combine individual prices into an overall price level, many people
find that their first impulse is to calculate the average of the
prices. Such a calculation, however, could easily be misleading
because some products matter more than others.</p>

<p>Calculating an Annual Rate of Inflation</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark697" class="s84">Consider the simple basket of goods with only three items, represented in</a>
Table 9.2<span class="s37">. Say that in any given month, a college
student spends money on 20 hamburgers, one bottle of aspirin, and
five movies. The table provides prices for these items over four
years through each time period (Pd). Prices of some goods in the
basket may rise while others fall. In this example, the price of
aspirin does not change over the four years, while movies increase
in price and hamburgers bounce up and down. The table shows the cost
of buying the</span></p>
<p>Changes in the prices of goods for which people spend a larger share
of their incomes will matter more than changes in the prices of
goods for which people spend a smaller share of their incomes. For
example, an increase of 10% in the rental rate on housing matters
more to most people than whether the price of carrots rises by 10%.
To construct an overall measure of the price level, economists
compute a weighted average of the prices of the items in the basket,
where the weights are based on the actual quantities of goods and
services people buy. The following Work It Out feature walks you
through the steps of calculating the annual rate of inflation based
on a few products.</p>

<p>Table 9.2 A College Student’s Basket of Goods</p>
<p>To calculate the annual rate of inflation in this example:</p>
<p><span id="bookmark698">Step 1. Find the percentage change in the
cost of purchasing the overall basket of goods between the time
periods. The general equation for percentage changes between two
years, whether in the context of inflation or in any other
calculation, is:</span></p>
<p>⎝
                                                                                                                                            
 ⎠</p>
<p>⎛<span class="s16">Level in new year – Level in previous year
</span>⎞</p>
<p>Level in previous year</p>
<p>x 100 = Percentage change</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark697" class="s84">Step 2. From period 1 to period 2, the total cost of purchasing the basket of goods in</a>
<a href="#bookmark697" class="s43">Table 9.2</a> <span
class="s37">rises from</span></p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(100 to \)</span>106.50. Therefore, the percentage change over this time—the
inflation rate—is:</p>
<p>(106.50 – 100)</p>
<p>100.0</p>
<p>= 0.065 = 6.5%</p>
<p>Step 3. From period 2 to period 3, the overall change in the cost of
purchasing the basket rises from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(106.50 to \)</span>107. Thus, the
inflation rate over this time, again calculated by the percentage
change, is approximately:</p>
<p>(107 – 106.50)</p>
<p>106.50</p>
<p>= 0.0047 = 0.47%</p>
<p>Step 4. From period 3 to period 4, the overall cost rises from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(107
to \)</span>117.50. The inflation rate is thus:</p>
<p>(117.50 – 107)</p>
<p>107</p>
<p>= 0.098 = 9.8%</p>
<p>This calculation of the change in the total cost of purchasing a
basket of goods accounts for how much a student spends on each good.
Hamburgers are the lowest-priced good in this example, and aspirin
is the highest-priced. If an individual buys a greater quantity of a
low-price good, then it makes sense that changes in the price of
that good should have a larger impact on the buying power of that
person’s money. The larger impact of hamburgers shows up in the
“amount spent” row, where, in all time periods, hamburgers are the

<p><a href="#bookmark697" class="s34">The numerical results of a calculation based on a basket of goods can get a little messy. The simplified example in</a>
<a href="#bookmark697" class="a">Table 9.2</a> <span class="p">has
only three goods and the prices are in even dollars, not numbers
like 79 cents or $124.99. If the list of products were much longer,
and we used more realistic prices, the total quantity spent over a
year might be some</span></p>
<p>messy-looking number like <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(17,147.51 or \)</span>27,654.92.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark699">To simplify the task of interpreting the
price levels for more realistic and complex baskets of goods,
economists typically report the price level in each period as
an</span> <strong>index number</strong>, rather than as the dollar amount for
buying the basket of goods. Economists create price indices to
calculate an overall average change in relative prices over time. To
convert the money spent on the basket to an index number, economists
arbitrarily choose one year to be the <strong>base year</strong>, or starting
point from which we measure changes in prices. The base year, by
definition, has an index number equal to 100. This sounds
complicated, but it is really a simple math trick. In the example
above, say that we choose time period 3 as the base year. Since the
total amount of spending in that year is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(107, we divide that amount
by itself (\)</span>107) and multiply by 100. Again, this is because the
index number in the base year <em>always</em> has to have a value of<span
id="bookmark700">‌</span></p>
<p>100. Then, to figure out the values of the index number for the
other years, we divide the dollar amounts for the other years by
1.07 as well. Note also that the dollar signs cancel out so that
index numbers have no units.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark701" class="a">Table 9.3</a>
<a href="#bookmark697" class="s34">shows calculations for the other values of the index number, based on the example in</a>
<a href="#bookmark697" class="a">Table</a> 9.2<span class="p">.
Because we calculate the index numbers so that they are in exactly
the same proportion as the total dollar cost of purchasing the
basket of goods, we can calculate the inflation rate based on the
index numbers, using the percentage change formula. Thus, the
inflation rate from period 1 to period 2 would be</span></p>
<p>(99.5 – 93.4)</p>
<p>93.4</p>
<p>= 0.065 = 6.5%</p>
<p>This is the same answer that we derived when measuring inflation
based on the dollar cost of the basket of goods for the same time
period.</p>

<p>Table 9.3 Calculating Index Numbers When Period 3 is the Base Year</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_211.png" width="624" height="51" alt="image" />
<p>Why do you not just subtract index numbers?</p>
<p>A word of warning: When a price index moves from, say, 107 to 110,
the rate of inflation is not <em>exactly</em> 3%. Remember, the inflation
rate is not derived by subtracting the index numbers, but rather
through the percentage-change calculation. We calculate the precise
inflation rate as the price index moves from 107 to</p>
<p>If the inflation rate is the same whether it is based on dollar
values or index numbers, then why bother with the index numbers? The
advantage is that indexing allows easier eyeballing of the inflation
numbers. If you glance at two index numbers like 107 and 110, you
know automatically that the rate of inflation between the two years
is about, but not quite exactly equal to, 3%. By contrast, imagine
that we express the price levels in absolute dollars of a large
basket of goods, so that when you looked at the data, the numbers
were <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(19,493.62 and \)</span>20,040.17. Most people find it difficult to
eyeball those kinds of numbers and say that it is a change of about
3%. However, the two numbers expressed in absolute dollars are
exactly in the same proportion of 107 to 110 as the previous
example. If you’re wondering why simple subtraction of the index
numbers wouldn’t work, read the following Clear It Up feature.</p>
<p>110 as 100 x (110 – 107) / 107 = 100 x 0.028 = 2.8%. When the base
year is fairly close to 100, a quick subtraction is not a terrible
shortcut to calculating the inflation rate—but when precision
matters down to tenths of a percent, subtracting will not give the
right answer.</p>
<p>Two final points about index numbers are worth remembering. First,
index numbers have no dollar signs or other units attached to them.
Although we can use index numbers to calculate a percentage
inflation rate, the index numbers themselves do not have percentage
signs. Index numbers just mirror the proportions that we find in
other data. They transform the other data so that it is easier to
work with the data.</p>
<p>Second, the choice of a base year for the index number—that is, the
year that is automatically set equal to 100—is arbitrary. We choose
it as a starting point from which we can track changes in prices. In
the official inflation statistics, it is common to use one base year
for a few years, and then to update it, so that the base year of 100
is relatively close to the present. However, any base year that we
choose for the index numbers will result in exactly the same
inflation rate. To see this in the previous example, imagine that
period 1 is the base year when total spending was $100, and we
assign it an index number of 100. At a glance, you can see that the
index numbers would now exactly match the dollar figures, and the
inflation rate in the first period would be 6.5%.</p>

to Measure Changes in the Cost of Living</span><span
id="bookmark702">‌</span></p>
<p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Use the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to calculate U.S. inflation
rates</p></li>
<li><p>Identify several ways the Bureau of Labor Statistics avoids
biases in the Consumer Price Index (CPI)</p></li>
<li><p>Differentiate among the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the Producer
Price Index (PPI), the International Price Index, the Employment
Cost Index, and the GDP deflator.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span id="bookmark703">The most commonly cited measure of inflation
in the United States is the</span> <strong>Consumer Price Index (CPI)</strong>.
Government statisticians at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
calculate the CPI based on the prices in a fixed basket of goods and
services that represents the purchases of the average family of
four. In recent years, the statisticians have paid considerable
attention to a subtle problem: that the change in the total cost of
buying a fixed basket of goods and services over time is
conceptually not quite the same as the change in the cost of living,
because the cost of living represents how much it costs for a person
to feel that his or her consumption provides an equal level of
satisfaction or utility.<span id="bookmark704">‌</span></p>
<p>To understand the distinction, imagine that over the past 10 years,
the cost of purchasing a fixed basket of goods increased by 25% and
your salary also increased by 25%. Has your personal standard of
living held constant? If you</p>
<p>do not necessarily purchase an identical fixed basket of goods every
year, then an inflation calculation based on the cost of a fixed
basket of goods may be a misleading measure of how your cost of
living has changed. Two problems arise here: substitution bias and
quality/new goods bias.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark705">When the price of a good rises, consumers
tend to purchase less of it and to seek out substitutes instead.
Conversely, as the price of a good falls, people will tend to
purchase more of it. This pattern implies that goods with generally
rising prices should tend over time to become less important in the
overall basket of goods used to calculate inflation, while goods
with falling prices should tend to become more important. Consider,
as an example, a rise in the price of peaches by $100 per pound. If
consumers were utterly inflexible in their demand for peaches, this
would lead to a big rise in the price of food for consumers.
Alternatively, imagine that people are utterly indifferent to
whether they have peaches or other types of fruit. Now, if peach
prices rise, people completely switch to other fruit choices and the
average price of food does not change at all. A fixed and unchanging
basket of goods assumes that consumers are locked into buying
exactly the same goods, regardless of price changes—not a very
likely assumption. Thus,</span> <strong>substitution bias</strong>—the rise in
the price of a fixed basket of goods over time—tends to overstate
the rise in a consumer’s true cost of living, because it does not
take into account that the person can substitute away from goods
whose relative prices have risen.</p>

list of Ford car prices between 1909 and 1927. Consider how these
prices compare to today’s models. Is the product today of a
different quality?</span></p>
<p>The other major problem in using a fixed basket of goods as the
basis for calculating inflation is how to deal with the arrival of
improved versions of older goods or altogether new goods. Consider
the problem that arises if a cereal is improved by adding 12
essential vitamins and minerals—and also if a box of the cereal
costs 5% more. It would clearly be misleading to count the entire
resulting higher price as inflation, because the new price reflects
a higher quality (or at least different) product. Ideally, one would
like to know how much of the higher price is due to the quality
change, and how much of it is just a higher price. The Bureau of
Labor Statistics, which is responsible for computing the Consumer
Price Index, must deal with these difficulties in adjusting for
quality changes.</p>
<p>We can think of a new product as an extreme improvement in
quality—from something that did not exist to something that does.
However, the basket of goods that was fixed in the past obviously
does not include new goods created since then. The basket of goods
and services in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is revised and
updated over time, and so new products are gradually included.
However, the process takes some time. For example, room air
conditioners were widely sold in the early 1950s, but were not
introduced into the basket of goods behind the Consumer Price Index
until 1964. The VCR and personal computer were available in the late
1970s and widely sold by the early 1980s, but did not enter the CPI
basket of goods until 1987. By 1996, there were more than 40 million
cellular phone subscribers in the United States—but cell phones were
not yet part of the CPI basket of goods. The parade of inventions
has continued, with the CPI inevitably lagging a few years behind.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark706">The arrival of new goods creates problems
with respect to the accuracy of measuring inflation. The reason
people buy new goods, presumably, is that the new goods offer better
value for money than existing goods. Thus, if the price index leaves
out new goods, it overlooks one of the ways in which the cost of
living is improving. In addition, the price of a new good is often
higher when it is first introduced and then declines over time. If
the new good is not included in the CPI for some years, until its
price is already lower, the CPI may miss counting this price decline
altogether. Taking these arguments together, the</span>
<strong>quality/new goods bias</strong> means that the rise in the price of a
fixed basket of goods over time tends to overstate the rise in a
consumer’s true cost of living, because it does not account</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_214.png" width="624" height="755" alt="image" />
<p>for how improvements in the quality of existing goods or the
invention of new goods improves the standard of living. The
following Clear It Up feature is a must-read on how statisticians
comprise and calculate the CPI.</p>
<p>How do U.S. government statisticians measure the Consumer Price
Index?</p>
<p>When the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) calculates the
Consumer Price Index, the first task is to decide on a basket of
goods that is representative of the purchases of the average
household. We do this by using the Consumer Expenditure Survey, a
national survey of about 7,000 households, which provides detailed
information on spending habits. Statisticians divide consumer
expenditures into eight major groups (seen below), which in turn
they divide into more than 200 individual item categories. The BLS
currently uses 1982–1984 as the base period.</p>
<p>For each of the 200 individual expenditure items, the BLS chooses
several hundred very specific examples of that item and looks at the
prices of those examples. In figuring out the “breakfast cereal”
item under the overall category of “foods and beverages,” the BLS
picks several hundred examples of breakfast cereal. One example
might be the price of a 24-oz. box of a particular brand of cereal
sold at a particular store. The BLS statistically selects specific
products and sizes and stores to reflect what people buy and where
they shop. The basket of goods in the Consumer Price Index thus
consists of about 80,000 products; that is, several hundred specific
products in over 200 broad-item categories. Statisticians rotate
about one-quarter of these 80,000 specific products of the sample
each year, and replace them with a different set of products.</p>
<p>The next step is to collect data on prices. Data collectors visit or
call about 23,000 stores in 87 urban areas all over the United
States every month to collect prices on these 80,000 specific
products. The BLS also conducts a survey of 50,000 landlords or
tenants to collect information about rents.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark707" class="s84">Statisticians then calculate the Consumer Price Index by taking the 80,000 prices of individual products and combining them, using weights (see</a>
<a href="#bookmark707" class="s43">Figure</a> 9.2<span class="s37">)
determined by the quantities of these products that people buy and
allowing for factors like substitution between goods and quality
improvements, into price indices for the 200 or so overall items.
Then, the statisticians combine the price indices for the 200 items
into an overall Consumer Price Index. According the Consumer Price
Index website, there are eight categories that data collectors
use:</span></p>
<p>The Eight Major Categories in the Consumer Price Index</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Food and beverages (breakfast cereal, milk, coffee, chicken,
wine, full-service meals, and snacks)</p></li>
<li><p>Housing (renter’s cost of housing, homeowner’s cost of housing,
fuel oil, bedroom furniture)</p></li>
<li><p>Apparel (men’s shirts and sweaters, women’s dresses, jewelry)</p></li>
<li><p>Transportation (new vehicles, airline fares, gasoline, motor
vehicle insurance)</p></li>
<li><p>Medical care (prescription drugs and medical supplies,
physicians’ services, eyeglasses and eye care, hospital
services)</p></li>
<li><p>Recreation (televisions, cable television, pets and pet
products, sports equipment, admissions)</p></li>
<li><p>Education and communication (college tuition, postage, telephone
services, computer software and accessories)</p></li>
<li><p>Other goods and services (tobacco and smoking products, haircuts
and other personal services, funeral expenses)</p>

The next highest category, food and beverage at 15.3%, is less than half the size of housing. Other goods and services, and apparel, are the lowest at 3.4% and 3.3%, respectively. (Source: www.bls.gov/cpi)</a></p>
<p><span id="bookmark707">The CPI and Core Inflation Index</span></p>
<p>Imagine if you were driving a company truck across the country-
you probably would care about things like the prices of
available roadside food and motel rooms as well as the truck’s
operating condition. However, the manager of the firm might have
different priorities. He would care mostly about the truck’s
on-time performance and much less so about the food you were
eating and the places you were staying. In other words, the
company manager would be paying attention to the firm’s
production, while ignoring transitory elements that impacted
you, but did not affect the company’s bottom line.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark708">In a sense, a similar situation occurs
with regard to measures of inflation. As we’ve learned, CPI
measures prices as they affect everyday household spending.
Economists typically calculate a</span> <strong>core inflation index</strong>
by taking the CPI and excluding volatile economic variables. In
this way, economists have a better sense of the underlying
trends in prices that affect the cost of living.</p>
<p>Examples of excluded variables include energy and food prices,
which can jump around from month to month because of the
weather. According to an article by Kent Bernhard, during
Hurricane Katrina in 2005, a key supply point for the nation’s
gasoline was nearly knocked out. Gas prices quickly shot up
across the nation, in some places by up to 40 cents a gallon in
one day. This was not the cause of an economic policy but rather
a short-lived event until the pumps were restored in the region.
In this case, the CPI that month would register the change as a
cost of living event to households, but the core inflation index
would remain unchanged. As a result, the Federal Reserve’s
decisions on interest rates would not be influenced. Similarly,
droughts can cause world-wide spikes in food prices that, if
temporary, do not affect the nation’s economic capability.</p>
<p>As former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke noted in
1999 about the core inflation index, “It provide(s) a better
guide to monetary policy than the other indices, since it
measures the more persistent underlying inflation rather than
transitory influences on the price level.” Bernanke also noted
that it helps communicate that the Federal Reserve does not need
to respond to every inflationary shock since some price changes
are transitory and not part of a structural change in the
economy.</p>
<p>In sum, both the CPI and the core inflation index are important,
but serve different audiences. The CPI helps households
understand their overall cost of living from month to month,
while the core inflation index is a preferred gauge from which
to make important government policy changes.</p>
<p>Practical Solutions for the Substitution and the Quality/New
Goods Biases</p>
<p>By the early 2000s, the Bureau of Labor Statistics was using
alternative mathematical methods for calculating the Consumer
Price Index, more complicated than just adding up the cost of a
fixed basket of goods, to allow for some substitution between
goods. It was also updating the basket of goods behind the CPI
more frequently, so that it could include new and improved goods
more rapidly. For certain products, the BLS was carrying out
studies to try to measure the quality improvement. For example,
with computers, an economic study can try to adjust for changes
in speed, memory, screen size, and other product
characteristics, and then calculate the change in price after
accounting for these product changes. However, these adjustments
are inevitably imperfect, and exactly how to make these
adjustments is often a source of controversy among professional
economists.</p>
<p>By the early 2000s, the substitution bias and quality/new goods
bias had been somewhat reduced, so that since then the rise in
the CPI probably overstates the true rise in inflation by only
about 0.5% per year. Over one or a few years, this is not much.
Over a period of a decade or two, even half of a percent per
year compounds to a more significant amount. In addition, the
CPI tracks prices from physical locations, and not at online
sites like Amazon, where prices can be lower.</p>
<p>When measuring inflation (and other economic statistics, too), a
tradeoff arises between simplicity and interpretation. If we
calculate the inflation rate with a basket of goods that is
fixed and unchanging, then the calculation of an inflation rate
is straightforward, but the problems of substitution bias and
quality/new goods bias will arise. However, when the basket of
goods is allowed to shift and evolve to reflect substitution
toward lower relative prices, quality improvements, and new
goods, the technical details of calculating the inflation rate
grow more complex.</p>
<p>Additional Price Indices: PPI, GDP Deflator, and More</p>
<p>The basket of goods behind the Consumer Price Index represents
an average hypothetical U.S. household’s consumption, which is
to say that it does not exactly capture anyone’s personal
experience. When the task is to calculate an average level of
inflation, this approach works fine. What if, however, you are
concerned about inflation experienced by a certain group, like
the elderly, or the poor, or single-parent families with
children, or Hispanic- Americans? In specific situations, a
price index based on the buying power of the average consumer
may not feel quite right.</p>
<p>This problem has a straightforward solution. If the Consumer
Price Index does not serve the desired purpose, then invent
another index, based on a basket of goods appropriate for the
group of interest. The Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes a
number of experimental price indices: some for particular groups
like the elderly or the poor, some for different geographic
areas, and some for certain broad categories of goods like food
or housing.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark709">The BLS also calculates several price
indices that are not based on baskets of consumer goods. For
example, the</span> <strong>Producer Price Index (PPI)</strong> is based on
prices paid for supplies and inputs by producers of goods and
services. We can break it down into price indices for different
industries, commodities, and stages of processing (like finished
goods, intermediate goods, or crude materials for further
processing). There is an <strong>International Price Index</strong> based on
the prices of merchandise that is exported or imported. An
<strong>Employment Cost Index</strong> measures wage inflation in the labor
market. The <strong>GDP
deflator</strong><a href="http://bpp.mit.edu/usa/)" class="s34">, which the Bureau of Economic Analysis measures, is a price index that includes all the GDP components (that is, consumption plus investment plus government plus exports minus imports). Unlike the CPI, its baskets are not fixed but re-calculate what that year’s GDP would have been worth using the base-year’s prices. MIT’s Billion Prices Project is a more recent alternative attempt to measure prices: economists collect data online from retailers and then put them into an index that they compare to the CPI (Source: http://bpp.mit.edu/usa/).</a><span

<p>What’s the best measure of inflation? If one is concerned with
the most accurate measure of inflation, one should use the GDP
deflator as it picks up the prices of goods and services
produced. However, it is not a good measure of the cost of
living as it includes prices of many products not purchased by
households (for example, aircraft, fire engines, factory
buildings, office complexes, and bulldozers). If one wants the
most accurate measure of inflation as it impacts households, one
should use the CPI, as it only picks up prices of products
purchased by households. That is why economists sometimes refer
to the CPI as the cost-of-living index. As the Bureau of Labor
Statistics states on its website: “The ‘best’ measure of
inflation for a given application depends on the intended use of
the data.”</p>

<p>In the last three decades, inflation has been relatively low in the
U.S. economy, with the Consumer Price Index typically rising 2% to
4% per year. Looking back over the twentieth century, there have
been several periods where inflation caused the price level to rise
at double-digit rates, but nothing has come close to hyperinflation.</p>

1913, the graph starts out close to 10, rises to around 20 in
1920, stays around 16 or 17 until 1931, then falls to 13 or 14

settling to around 1.3% in 2016.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark715">The first two waves of inflation are easy
to characterize in historical terms: they are right after World
War I and World War II. However, there are also two periods of
severe negative inflation—called</span> <strong>deflation</strong>—in the
early decades of the twentieth century: one following the deep
1920-21 recession of and the other during the 1930s Great
Depression of the 1930s. (Since inflation is a time when the
buying power of money in terms of goods and services is reduced,
deflation will be a time when the buying power of money in terms
of goods and services increases.) For the period from 1900 to
about 1960, the major inflations and deflations nearly balanced
each other out, so the average annual rate of inflation over
these years was only about 1% per year. A third wave of more
severe inflation arrived in the</p>

<p>1970s and departed in the early 1980s.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark716">Times of recession or depression often
seem to be times when the inflation rate is lower, as in the
recession of 1920–1921, the Great Depression, the recession of
1980–1982, and the Great Recession in 2008–2009. There were a
few months in 2009 that were deflationary, but not at an annual
rate. High levels of unemployment typically accompany
recessions, and the total demand for goods falls, pulling the
price level down. Conversely, the rate of inflation often, but
not always, seems to start moving up when the economy is growing
very strongly, like right after wartime or during the 1960s. The
frameworks for macroeconomic analysis, that we developed in
other chapters, will explain why recession often accompanies
higher unemployment and lower inflation, while rapid economic
growth often brings lower unemployment but higher
inflation.</span></p>
<p>Inflation around the World</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark717" class="s34">Around the rest of the world, the pattern of inflation has been very mixed;</a>
<a href="#bookmark717" class="a">Figure 9.4</a> <span

Many industrialized countries, not just the United States, had
relatively high inflation rates in the 1970s. For example, in
1975, Japan’s inflation rate was over 8% and the inflation rate
for the United Kingdom was almost 25%. In the 1980s, inflation
rates came down in the United States and in Europe and have
largely stayed down.</span></p>

<p><span id="bookmark718">Countries with controlled economies in
the 1970s, like the Soviet Union and China, historically had
very low rates of measured inflation—because prices were
forbidden to rise by law, except for the cases where the
government deemed a price increase to be due to quality
improvements. However, these countries also had perpetual
shortages of goods, since forbidding prices to rise acts like a
price ceiling and creates a situation where quantity demanded
often exceeds quantity supplied. As Russia and China made a
transition toward more market-oriented economies, they also
experienced outbursts of inflation, although we should regard
the statistics for these economies as somewhat shakier.
Inflation in China averaged about 10% per year for much of the
1980s and early 1990s, although it has dropped off since then.
Russia experienced</span>

<p>Many countries in Latin America experienced raging inflation
during the 1980s and early 1990s, with inflation rates often
well above 100% per year. In 1990, for example, both Brazil and
Argentina saw inflation climb above 2000%. Certain countries in
Africa experienced extremely high rates of inflation, sometimes
bordering on hyperinflation, in the 1990s. Nigeria, the most
populous country in Africa, had an inflation rate of 75%
in 1995.</p>
<p>In the early 2000s, the problem of inflation appears to have
diminished for most countries, at least in comparison to the
worst times of recent decades. As we noted in this earlier Bring
it Home feature, in recent years, the world’s worst example of
hyperinflation was in Zimbabwe, where at one point the
government was issuing bills with a face value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(100 trillion

triple-digit, and even quadruple-digit inflation is not very far

</ul>
<p><span id="bookmark721">Economists usually oppose high inflation,
but they oppose it in a milder way than many non-economists.
Robert Shiller, one of 2013’s Nobel Prize winners in economics,
carried out several surveys during the 1990s about attitudes
toward inflation. One of his questions asked, “Do you agree that
preventing high inflation is an important national priority, as
important as preventing drug abuse or preventing deterioration
in the quality of our schools?” Answers were on a scale of 1–5,
where 1 meant “Fully agree” and 5 meant “Completely disagree.”
For the U.S. population as a whole, 52% answered “Fully agree”
that preventing high inflation was a highly important national
priority and just 4% said “Completely disagree.” However, among
professional economists, only 18% answered “Fully agree,” while
the same percentage of 18% answered “Completely
disagree.”</span></p>
<p>The Land of Funny Money</p>
<p><span id="bookmark722">What are the economic problems caused by
inflation, and why do economists often regard them with less
concern than the general public? Consider a very short story:
“The Land of Funny Money.”</span></p>
<p>One morning, everyone in the Land of Funny Money awakened to
find that everything denominated in money had increased by 20%.
The change was completely unexpected. Every price in every store
was 20% higher. Paychecks were 20% higher. Interest rates were
20 % higher. The amount of money, everywhere from wallets to
savings accounts, was 20% larger. This overnight inflation of
prices made newspaper headlines everywhere in the Land of Funny
Money. However, the headlines quickly disappeared, as people
realized that in terms of what they could actually buy with
their incomes, this inflation had no economic impact. Everyone’s
pay could still buy exactly the same set of goods as it did
before. Everyone’s savings were still sufficient to buy exactly
the same car, vacation, or retirement that they could have
bought before. Equal levels of inflation in all wages and prices
ended up not mattering much at all.</p>
<p>When the people in Robert Shiller’s surveys explained their
concern about inflation, one typical reason was that they feared
that as prices rose, they would not be able to afford to buy as
much. In other words, people were worried because they did not
live in a place like the Land of Funny Money, where all prices
and wages rose simultaneously. Instead, people live here on
Planet Earth, where prices might rise while wages do not rise at
all, or where wages rise more slowly than prices.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark723">Economists note that over most periods,
the inflation level in prices is roughly similar to the
inflation level in wages, and so they reason that, on average,
over time, people’s economic status is not greatly changed by
inflation. If all prices, wages, and interest rates adjusted
automatically and immediately with inflation, as in the Land of
Funny Money, then no one’s purchasing power, profits, or real
loan payments would change. However, if other economic variables
do not move exactly in sync with inflation, or if they adjust
for inflation only after a time lag, then inflation can cause
three types of problems: unintended redistributions of
purchasing power, blurred price signals, and difficulties in
long-term planning.</span><span id="bookmark724">‌</span></p>
<p>Unintended Redistributions of Purchasing Power</p>
<p>Inflation can cause redistributions of purchasing power that
hurt some and help others. People who are hurt by inflation
include those who are holding considerable cash, whether it is
in a safe deposit box or in a cardboard box under the bed. When
inflation happens, the buying power of cash diminishes. However,
cash is only an example of a more general problem: anyone who
has financial assets invested in a way that the nominal return
does not keep up with inflation will tend to suffer from
inflation. For example, if a person has money in a bank account
that pays 4% interest, but inflation rises to 5%, then the real
rate of return for the money invested in that bank account is
negative 1%.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark725">The problem of a good-looking nominal
interest rate transforming into an ugly-looking real interest
rate can be worsened by taxes. The U.S. income tax is charged on
the nominal interest received in dollar terms, without an
adjustment for inflation. Thus, the government taxes a person
who invests <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10,000 and receives a 5% nominal rate of interest
on the \)</span>500 received—no matter whether the inflation rate is 0%,
5%, or 10%. If inflation is 0%, then the real interest rate is
5% and all <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(500 is a gain in buying power. However, if inflation
is 5%, then the real interest rate is zero and the person had no
real gain—but owes income tax on the nominal gain anyway. If
inflation is 10%, then the real interest rate is&lt;/span&gt;
*negative* 5% and the person is actually falling behind in
buying power, but would still owe taxes on the \)</span>500 in nominal
gains.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark693" id="bookmark726" class="s34">Inflation can cause unintended redistributions for wage earners, too. Wages do typically creep up with inflation over time, eventually. The last row of</a>
<a href="#bookmark693" class="a">Table 9.1</a>
<a href="#bookmark727" class="s34">at the start of this chapter showed that the average hourly wage in manufacturing in the U.S. economy increased from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3.23 in 1970 to \)</span>20.65 in 2017, which is an increase by a factor of more than six. Over that time period, the Consumer Price Index increased by an almost identical amount. However, increases in wages may lag behind inflation for a year or two, since wage adjustments are often somewhat sticky and occur only once or twice a year. Moreover, the extent to which wages keep up with inflation creates insecurity for workers and may involve painful, prolonged conflicts between employers and employees. If the government adjusts minimum wage for inflation only infrequently, minimum wage workers are losing purchasing power from their nominal wages, as</a>
<a href="#bookmark727" class="a">Figure 9.6</a> <span
class="p">shows.</span></p>

<a href="http://www.dol.gov/whd/minwage/chart.htm%3B" class="s84">After adjusting for inflation, the federal minimum wage dropped more than 30 percent from 1967 to 2010, even though the nominal figure climbed from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1.40 to \)</span>7.25 per hour. Increases in the minimum wage in between 2008 and 2010 kept the decline from being worse—as it would have been if the wage had remained the same as it did from 1997 through 2007. Since 2010, the real minimum wage has continued to decline. (Sources: http://www.dol.gov/whd/minwage/chart.htm;</a>

<p><span id="bookmark728">One sizable group of people has often
received a large share of their income in a form that does not
increase over time: retirees who receive a private company
pension. Most pensions have traditionally been set as a fixed
nominal dollar amount per year at retirement. For this reason,
economists call pensions “defined benefits” plans. Even if
inflation is low, the combination of inflation and a fixed
income can create a substantial problem over time. A person who
retires on a fixed income at age 65 will find that losing just
1% to 2% of buying power per year to inflation compounds to a
considerable loss of buying power after a decade or two.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark729">Fortunately, pensions and other defined
benefits retirement plans are increasingly rare, replaced
instead by “defined contribution” plans, such as 401(k)s and
403(b)s. In these plans, the employer contributes a fixed amount
to the worker’s retirement account on a regular basis (usually
every pay check). The employee often contributes as well. The
worker invests these funds in a wide range of investment
vehicles. These plans are tax deferred, and they are portable so
that if the individual takes a job with a different employer,
their 401(k) comes with them. To the extent that the investments
made generate real rates of return, retirees do not suffer from
the inflation costs of traditional pensioners.</span></p>
<p>However, ordinary people can sometimes benefit from the
unintended redistributions of inflation. Consider someone who
borrows $10,000 to buy a car at a fixed interest rate of 9%. If
inflation is 3% at the time the loan is made, then he or she
must repay the loan at a real interest rate of 6%. However, if
inflation rises to 9%, then the real interest rate on the loan
is zero. In this case, the borrower’s benefit from inflation is
the lender’s loss. A borrower paying a fixed interest rate, who
benefits from inflation, is just the flip side of an investor
receiving a fixed interest rate, who suffers</p>
<p>from inflation. The lesson is that when interest rates are
fixed, rises in the rate of inflation tend to penalize suppliers
of financial capital, who receive repayment in dollars that are
worth less because of inflation, while demanders of financial
capital end up better off, because they can repay their loans in
dollars that are worth less than originally expected.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_221.png" width="624" height="51" alt="image" />
<p>Is there a connection between German hyperinflation and Hitler’s
rise to power?</p>
<p>Germany suffered an intense hyperinflation of its currency, the
Mark, in the years after World War I, when the Weimar Republic
in Germany resorted to printing money to pay its bills and the
onset of the Great Depression created the social turmoil that
Adolf Hitler was able to take advantage of in his rise to power.
Shiller described the connection this way in a National Bureau
of Economic Research 1996 Working Paper:</p>
<p>A fact that is probably little known to young people today, even
in Germany, is that the final collapse of the Mark in 1923, the
time when the Mark’s inflation reached astronomical levels
(inflation of 35,974.9% in November 1923 alone, for an annual
rate that month of 4.69 × 10<span class="s65">28</span>%), came
in the same month as did Hitler’s Beer Hall Putsch, his Nazi
Party’s armed attempt to overthrow the German government. This
failed putsch resulted in Hitler’s imprisonment, at which time
he wrote his book <em>Mein Kampf</em>, setting forth an inspirational
plan for Germany’s future, suggesting plans for world
domination…</p>
<p>… Most people in Germany today probably do not clearly
remember these events; this lack of attention to it may be
because its memory is blurred by the more dramatic events that
succeeded it (the Nazi seizure of power and World War II).
However, to someone living through these historical events in
sequence … [the putsch] may have been remembered as vivid
evidence of the potential effects of inflation.</p>
<p>The unintended redistributions of buying power that inflation
causes may have a broader effect on society. America’s
widespread acceptance of market forces rests on a perception
that people’s actions have a reasonable connection to market
outcomes. When inflation causes a retiree who built up a pension
or invested at a fixed interest rate to suffer, however, while
someone who borrowed at a fixed interest rate benefits from
inflation, it is hard to believe that this outcome was deserved
in any way. Similarly, when homeowners benefit from inflation
because the price of their homes rises, while renters suffer
because they are paying higher rent, it is hard to see any
useful incentive effects. One of the reasons that the general
public dislikes inflation is a sense that it makes economic
rewards and penalties more arbitrary—and therefore likely to be
perceived as unfair – even dangerous, as the next Clear It Up
feature shows.</p>
<p>Blurred Price Signals</p>
<p><span id="bookmark730">Prices are the messengers in a market
economy, conveying information about conditions of demand and
supply. Inflation blurs those price messages. Inflation means
that we perceive price signals more vaguely, like a radio
program received with considerable static. If the static becomes
severe, it is hard to tell what is happening.</span></p>
<p>In Israel, when inflation accelerated to an annual rate of 500%
in 1985, some stores stopped posting prices directly on items,
since they would have had to put new labels on the items or
shelves every few days to reflect inflation. Instead, a shopper
just took items from a shelf and went up to the checkout
register to find out the price for that day. Obviously, this
situation makes comparing prices and shopping for the best deal
rather difficult. When the levels and changes of prices become
uncertain, businesses and individuals find it harder to react to
economic signals. In a world where inflation is at a high rate,
but bouncing up and down to some extent, does a higher price of
a good mean that inflation has risen, or that supply of that
good has decreased, or that demand for that good has increased?
Should a buyer of the good take the higher prices as an economic
hint to start substituting other products—or have the prices of
the substitutes risen by an equal amount? Should a seller of the
good take a higher price as a reason to increase production—or
is the higher price only a sign of a general inflation in which
the prices of all inputs to production are rising as well? The
true story will presumably become clear over time, but at a
given moment, who can say?</p>
<p><span id="bookmark731">High and variable inflation means that
the incentives in the economy to adjust in response to changes
in prices are weaker. Markets will adjust toward their
equilibrium prices and quantities more erratically and slowly,
and many individual markets will experience a greater chance of
surpluses and shortages.</span></p>
<p>Problems of Long-Term Planning</p>
<p><span id="bookmark732">Inflation can make long-term planning
difficult. In discussing unintended redistributions, we
considered the case of someone trying to plan for retirement
with a pension that is fixed in nominal terms and a high rate of
inflation. Similar problems arise for all people trying to save
for retirement, because they must consider what their money will
really buy several decades in the future when we cannot know the
rate of future inflation.</span></p>
<p>Inflation, especially at moderate or high levels, will pose
substantial planning problems for businesses, too. A firm can
make money from inflation—for example, by paying bills and wages
as late as possible so that it can pay in inflated dollars,
while collecting revenues as soon as possible. A firm can also
suffer losses from inflation, as in the case of a retail
business that gets stuck holding too much cash, only to see
inflation eroding the value of that cash. However, when a
business spends its time focusing on how to profit by inflation,
or at least how to avoid suffering from it, an inevitable
tradeoff strikes: less time is spent on improving products and
services or on figuring out how to make existing products and
services more cheaply. An economy with high inflation rewards
businesses that have found clever ways of profiting from
inflation, which are not necessarily the businesses that excel
at productivity, innovation, or quality of service.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark733" class="s34">In the short term, low or moderate levels of inflation may not pose an overwhelming difficulty for business planning, because costs of doing business and sales revenues may rise at similar rates. If, however, inflation varies substantially over the short or medium term, then it may make sense for businesses to stick to shorter-term strategies. The evidence as to whether relatively low rates of inflation reduce productivity is controversial among economists. There is some evidence that if inflation can be held to moderate levels of less than 3% per year, it need not prevent a nation’s real economy from growing at a healthy pace. For some countries that have experienced hyperinflation of several thousand percent per year, an annual inflation rate of 20–30% may feel basically the same as zero. However, several economists have pointed to the suggestive fact that when U.S. inflation heated up in the early 1970s—to 10%—U.S. growth in productivity slowed down, and when inflation slowed down in the 1980s, productivity edged up again not long thereafter, as</a>

last several decades in the United States, there have been times
when rising inflation rates have been closely followed by lower
productivity rates and lower inflation rates have corresponded
to increasing productivity rates. As the graph shows, however,
this correlation does not always exist.</span></p>
<p>Any Benefits of Inflation?</p>
<p>Although the economic effects of inflation are primarily
negative, two countervailing points are worth noting. First,</p>
<p>the impact of inflation will differ considerably according to
whether it is creeping up slowly at 0% to 2% per year, galloping
along at 10% to 20% per year, or racing to the point of
hyperinflation at, say, 40% per month. Hyperinflation can rip an
economy and a society apart. An annual inflation rate of 2%, 3%,
or 4%, however, is a long way from a national crisis. Low
inflation is also better than deflation which occurs with severe
recessions.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark619" id="bookmark734" class="s34">Second, economists sometimes argue that moderate inflation may help the economy by making wages in labor markets more flexible. The discussion in</a>
<a href="#bookmark619" class="a">Unemployment</a> <span
class="p">pointed out that wages tend to be sticky in their
downward movements and that unemployment can result. A little
inflation could nibble away at real wages, and thus help real
wages to decline if necessary. In this way, even if a moderate
or high rate of inflation may act as sand in the gears of the
economy, perhaps a low rate of inflation serves as oil for the
gears of the labor market. This argument is controversial. A
full analysis would have to account for all the effects of
inflation. It does, however, offer another reason to believe
that, all things considered, very low rates of inflation may not
be especially harmful.</span></p>

<p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Explain the relationship between indexing and inflation</p></li>
<li><p>Identify three ways the government can control inflation through
macroeconomic policy</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span id="bookmark736">When a price, wage, or interest rate is adjusted
automatically with inflation, economists use the term</span>
<strong>indexed</strong>. An indexed payment increases according to the index number
that measures inflation. Those in private markets and government
programs observe a wide range of indexing arrangements. Since the
negative effects of inflation depend in large part on having inflation
unexpectedly affect one part of the economy but not another—say,
increasing the prices that people pay but not the wages that workers
receive—indexing will take some of the sting out of inflation.<span
id="bookmark737">‌</span></p>
<p>Indexing in Private Markets</p>
<p><span id="bookmark738">In the 1970s and 1980s, labor unions commonly
negotiated wage contracts that had</span> <strong>cost-of-living adjustments
(COLAs)</strong> which guaranteed that their wages would keep up with
inflation. These contracts were sometimes written as, for example, COLA
plus 3%. Thus, if inflation was 5%, the wage increase would
automatically be 8%, but if inflation rose to 9%, the wage increase
would automatically be 12%. COLAs are a form of indexing applied to
wages.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark739">Loans often have built-in inflation adjustments,
too, so that if the inflation rate rises by two percentage points, then
the interest rate that a financial institution charges on the loan rises
by two percentage points as well. An</span> <strong>adjustable- rate mortgage
(ARM)</strong> is a type of loan that one can use to purchase a home in which
the interest rate varies with the rate of inflation. Often, a borrower
will be able receive a lower interest rate if borrowing with an ARM,
compared to a fixed-rate loan. The reason is that with an ARM, the
lender is protected against the risk that higher inflation will reduce
the real loan payments, and so the risk premium part of the interest
rate can be correspondingly lower.</p>
<p>A number of ongoing or long-term business contracts also have provisions
that prices will adjust automatically according to inflation. Sellers
like such contracts because they are not locked into a low nominal
selling price if inflation turns out higher than expected. Buyers like
such contracts because they are not locked into a high buying price if
inflation turns out to be lower than expected. A contract with automatic
adjustments for inflation in effect agrees on a real price for the
borrower to pay, rather than a nominal price.</p>
<p>Indexing in Government Programs</p>
<p>Many government programs are indexed to inflation. The U.S. income tax
code is designed so that as a person’s income rises above certain
levels, the tax rate on the marginal income earned rises as well. That
is what the expression “move into a higher tax bracket” means. For
example, according to the basic tax tables from the Internal Revenue
Service, in 2017 a single person owed 10% of all taxable income from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0
to \)</span>9,325; 15% of all income from $9,326 to</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(37,950; 25% of all taxable income from \)</span>37,951 to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(91,900; 28% of all
taxable income from \)</span>91,901 to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(191,650; 33% of all taxable income from
\)</span>191,651 to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(416,700; 35% of all taxable income from \)</span>416,701 to
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(418,400; and 39.6% of all income from \)</span>418,401 and above.</p>
<p>Because of the many complex provisions in the rest of the tax code, it
is difficult to determine exactly the taxes an individual owes the
government based on these numbers, but the numbers illustrate the basic
theme that tax rates rise as the marginal dollar of income rises. Until
the late 1970s, if nominal wages increased along with inflation, people
were moved into higher tax brackets and owed a higher proportion of
their income in taxes, even though their real</p>
<p>income had not risen. In 1981, the government eliminated this “bracket
creep”. Now, the income levels where higher tax rates kick in are
indexed to rise automatically with inflation.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark740">The Social Security program offers two examples
of indexing. Since the passage of the Social Security Indexing Act of
1972, the level of Social Security benefits increases each year along
with the Consumer Price Index. Also, Social Security is funded by
payroll taxes, which the government imposes on the income earned up to a
certain amount—$117,000 in 2014. The government adjusts this level of
income upward each year according to the rate of inflation, so that an
indexed increase in the Social Security tax base accompanies the indexed
rise in the benefit level.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark741">As yet another example of a government program
affected by indexing, in 1996 the U.S., government began offering
indexed bonds. Bonds are means by which the U.S. government (and many
private-sector companies as well) borrows money; that is, investors buy
the bonds, and then the government repays the money with interest.
Traditionally, government bonds have paid a fixed rate of interest. This
policy gave a government that had borrowed an incentive to encourage
inflation, because it could then repay its past borrowing in inflated
dollars at a lower real interest rate. However, indexed bonds promise to
pay a certain real rate of interest above whatever inflation rate
occurs. In the case of a retiree trying to plan for the long term and
worried about the risk of inflation, for example, indexed bonds that
guarantee a rate of return higher than inflation—no matter the level of
inflation—can be a very comforting investment.</span></p>
<p>Might Indexing Reduce Concern over Inflation?</p>
<p>Indexing may seem like an obviously useful step. After all, when
individuals, firms, and government programs are indexed against
inflation, then people can worry less about arbitrary redistributions
and other effects of inflation.</p>
<p>However, some of the fiercest opponents of inflation express grave
concern about indexing. They point out that indexing is always partial.
Not every employer will provide COLAs for workers. Not all companies can
assume that costs and revenues will rise in lockstep with the general
rates of inflation. Not all interest rates for borrowers and savers will
change to match inflation exactly. However, as partial inflation
indexing spreads, the political opposition to inflation may diminish.
After all, older people whose Social Security benefits are protected
against inflation, or banks that have loaned their money with
adjustable-rate loans, no longer have as much reason to care whether
inflation heats up. In a world where some people are indexed against
inflation and some are not, financially savvy businesses and investors
may seek out ways to be protected against inflation, while the
financially unsophisticated and small businesses may suffer from it
most.</p>
<p>A Preview of Policy Discussions of Inflation</p>
<p>This chapter has focused on how economists measure inflation, historical
experience with inflation, how to adjust nominal variables into real
ones, how inflation affects the economy, and how indexing works. We have
barely hinted at the causes of inflation, and we have not addressed
government policies to deal with inflation. We will examine these issues
in depth in other chapters. However, it is useful to offer a preview
here.</p>
<p>We can sum up the cause of inflation in one phrase: Too many dollars
chasing too few goods. The great surges of inflation early in the
twentieth century came after wars, which are a time when government
spending is very high, but consumers have little to buy, because
production is going to the war effort. Governments also commonly impose
price controls during wartime. After the war, the price controls end and
pent-up buying power surges forth, driving up inflation. Otherwise, if
too few dollars are chasing too many goods, then inflation will decline
or even turn into deflation. Therefore, we typically associate slowdowns
in economic activity, as in major recessions and the Great Depression,
with a reduction in inflation or even outright deflation.</p>
<p>The policy implications are clear. If we are to avoid inflation, the
amount of purchasing power in the economy must grow at roughly the same
rate as the production of goods. Macroeconomic policies that the
government can use to affect the amount of purchasing power—through
taxes, spending, and regulation of interest rates and credit—can thus
cause inflation to rise or reduce inflation to lower levels.</p>

<p>A $550 Million Loaf of Bread?</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1071" class="s84">As we will learn in</a> Money and
Banking<span class="s37">, the existence of money provides enormous
benefits to an economy. In a real sense, money is the lubrication that
enhances the workings of markets. Money makes transactions easier. It
allows people to find employment producing one product, then use the
money earned to purchase the other products they need to live. However,
too much money in circulation can lead to inflation. Extreme cases of
governments recklessly printing money lead to hyperinflation. Inflation
reduces the value of money. Hyperinflation, because money loses value so
quickly, ultimately results in people no longer using money. The economy
reverts to barter, or it adopts another country’s more stable currency,
like U.S. dollars. In the meantime, the economy literally falls apart as
people leave jobs and fend for themselves because it is not worth the
time to work for money that will be worthless in a few days.</span></p>
<p>Only national governments have the power to cause hyperinflation.
Hyperinflation typically happens when government faces extraordinary
demands for spending, which it cannot finance by taxes or borrowing. The
only option is to print money—more and more of it. With more money in
circulation chasing the same amount (or even fewer) goods and services,
the only result is increasingly higher prices until the economy and/or
the government collapses. This is why economists are generally wary of
letting inflation spiral out of control.</p>

<p>KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY</p>
<ol>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark692" class="a">Tracking</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark692">Inflation</a></p>
<p>Economists measure the price level by using a basket of goods and
services and calculating how the total cost of</p>
<p>buying that basket of goods will increase over time. Economists
often express the price level in terms of index numbers, which
transform the cost of buying the basket of goods and services into a
series of numbers in the same proportion to each other, but with an
arbitrary base year of 100. We measure the inflation rate as the
percentage change between price levels or index numbers over time.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark702" class="a">How to Measure Changes in the Cost of</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark702">Living</a></p>
<p>Measuring price levels with a fixed basket of goods will always have
two problems: the substitution bias, by which a fixed basket of
goods does not allow for buying more of what becomes relatively less
expensive and less of what becomes relatively more expensive; and
the quality/new goods bias, by which a fixed basket cannot account
for improvements in quality and the advent of new goods. These
problems can be reduced in degree—for example, by allowing the
basket of goods to evolve over time—but we cannot totally eliminate
them. The most commonly cited measure of inflation is the Consumer
Price Index (CPI), which is based on a basket of goods representing
what the typical consumer buys. The Core Inflation Index further
breaks down the CPI by excluding volatile economic commodities.
Several price indices are not based on baskets of consumer goods.
The GDP deflator is based on all GDP components. The Producer Price
Index is based on prices of supplies and inputs bought by producers
of goods and services. An Employment Cost Index measures wage
inflation in the labor market. An International Price Index is based
on the prices of merchandise that is exported or imported.</p>

<li><p><a href="#bookmark713" class="a">How the U.S. and Other Countries Experience</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark713">Inflation</a></p>
<p>In the U.S. economy, the annual inflation rate in the last two
decades has typically been around 2% to 4%. The periods of highest
inflation in the United States in the twentieth century occurred
during the years after World Wars I and II, and in the 1970s. The
period of lowest inflation—actually, with deflation—was the 1930s
Great Depression.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark720" class="a">The Confusion Over</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark720">Inflation</a></p>
<p>Unexpected inflation will tend to hurt those whose money received,
in terms of wages and interest payments, does not rise with
inflation. In contrast, inflation can help those who owe money that
they can pay in less valuable, inflated dollars. Low rates of
inflation have relatively little economic impact over the short
term. Over the medium and the long term, even low rates of inflation
can complicate future planning. High rates of inflation can muddle
price signals in the short term and prevent market forces from
operating efficiently, and can vastly complicate long-term savings
and investment decisions.</p>

<p>A payment is indexed if it is automatically adjusted for inflation.
Examples of indexing in the private sector include wage contracts with

<p>REVIEW QUESTIONS</p>
</li>
<li><p>How do economists use a basket of goods and services to measure the
price level?</p></li>
<li><p>Why do economists use index numbers to measure the price level
rather than dollar value of goods?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the difference between the price level and the rate of
inflation?</p></li>
<li><p>Why does “substitution bias” arise if we calculate the inflation
rate based on a fixed basket of goods?</p></li>
<li><p>Why does the “quality/new goods bias” arise if we calculate the
inflation rate based on a fixed basket of goods?</p>
<p>CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Inflation rates, like most statistics, are imperfect measures.
Can you identify some ways that the inflation rate for fruit
does not perfectly capture the rising price of fruit?</p></li>
<li><p>Given the federal budget deficit in recent years, some
economists have argued that by adjusting Social Security
payments for inflation using the CPI, Social Security is
overpaying recipients. What is their argument, and do you agree
or disagree with it?</p></li>
<li><p>Why is the GDP deflator not an accurate measure of inflation as
it impacts a household?</p></li>
<li><p>Imagine that the government statisticians who calculate the
inflation rate have been updating the basic basket of goods once
every 10 years, but now they decide to update it every five
years. How will this change affect the amount of substitution
bias and quality/new goods bias?</p></li>
<li><p>Describe a situation, either a government policy situation, an
economic problem, or a private sector situation, where using the
CPI to convert from nominal to real would be more appropriate
than using the GDP deflator.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>What has been a typical range of inflation in the</p>
<p>U.S. economy in the last decade or so?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Over the last century, during what periods was the</p>
<p>U.S. inflation rate highest and lowest?</p>
</li>
<li><p>What is deflation?</p></li>
<li><p>Identify several parties likely to be helped and hurt by inflation.</p></li>
<li><p>What is indexing?</p></li>
<li><p>Name several forms of indexing in the private and public sector.</p></li>
<li><p>Describe a situation, either a government policy situation, an
economic problem, or a private sector situation, where using the GDP
deflator to convert from nominal to real would be more appropriate
than using the CPI.</p></li>
<li><p>Why do you think the U.S. experience with inflation over the last 50
years has been so much milder than in many other countries?</p></li>
<li><p>If, over time, wages and salaries on average rise at least as fast
as inflation, why do people worry about how inflation affects
incomes?</p></li>
<li><p>Who in an economy is the big winner from inflation?</p></li>
<li><p>If a government gains from unexpected inflation when it borrows, why
would it choose to offer indexed bonds?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you think perfect indexing is possible? Why or why not?</p>
<p>PROBLEMS</p>
</li>
<li><p>The index number representing the price level changes from 110 to
115 in one year, and then from 115 to 120 the next year. Since the
index number increases by five each year, is five the inflation rate
each year? Is the inflation rate the same each year? Explain your
answer.</p></li>
<li><p>The total price of purchasing a basket of goods in the United
Kingdom over four years is: year 1=£940, year 2=£970, year 3=£1000,
and year 4=£1070. Calculate two price indices, one using year 1 as
the base year (set equal to 100) and the other using year 4 as the
base year (set equal to 100). Then, calculate the inflation rate
based on the first price index. If you had used the other price
index, would you get a different inflation rate? If you are unsure,
do the calculation and find out.</p></li>
<li><p>Within 1 or 2 percentage points, what has the U.S. inflation rate
been during the last 20 years? Draw a graph to show the data.</p></li>
<li><p>If inflation rises unexpectedly by 5%, indicate for each of the
following whether the economic actor is helped, hurt, or unaffected:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>A union member with a COLA wage contract</p></li>
<li><p>Someone with a large stash of cash in a safe deposit box</p></li>
<li><p>A bank lending money at a fixed rate of interest</p></li>
<li><p>A person who is not due to receive a pay raise for another 11
months</p></li>

<li><p>Rosalie the Retiree knows that when she retires in 16 years, her

inflation rate is 6% per year, how much buying power will that

<p>More than Meets the Eye in the Congo</p>
<p>How much do you interact with the global financial system? Do you think
not much? Think again. Suppose you take out a student loan, or you
deposit money into your bank account. You just affected domestic savings
and borrowing. Now say you are at the mall and buy two T-shirts “made in
China,” and later contribute to a charity that helps refugees. What is
the impact? You affected how much money flows into and out of the United
States. If you open an IRA savings account and put money in an
international mutual fund, you are involved in the flow of money
overseas. While your involvement may not seem as influential as that of
someone like the president, who can increase or decrease foreign aid
and, thereby, have a huge impact on money flows in and out of the
country, you do interact with the global financial system on a daily
basis.</p>
<p>The balance of payments—a term you will meet soon—seems like a huge
topic, but once you learn the specific components of trade and money, it
all makes sense. Along the way, you may have to give up some common
misunderstandings about trade and answer some questions: If a country is
running a trade deficit, is that bad? Is a trade surplus good? For
example, look at the Democratic Republic of the Congo (often referred to
as “Congo”), a large country in Central Africa. In 2013, it ran a trade
surplus of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1 billion, so it must be doing well, right? In contrast, the
trade deficit in the United States was \)</span>508 billion in 2013. Do these
figures suggest that the United States economy is performing worse than
the Congolese economy? Not necessarily. The U.S. trade deficit tends to
worsen as the economy strengthens. In contrast, high poverty rates in
the Congo persist, and these rates are not going down even with the
positive trade balance. Clearly, it is more complicated than</p>
<p>simply asserting that running a trade deficit is bad for the economy.
You will learn more about these issues and others in this chapter.</p>

<p><span id="bookmark781">The</span> <strong>balance of trade</strong>
<a href="#bookmark432" class="s34">(or trade balance) is any gap between a nation’s dollar value of its exports, or what its producers sell abroad, and a nation’s dollar value of imports, or the foreign-made products and services that households and businesses purchase. Recall from</a>
<a href="#bookmark432" class="a">The Macroeconomic Perspective</a><span
class="s54"> </span>that if exports exceed imports, the economy has a
trade surplus. If imports exceed exports, the economy has a trade
deficit. If exports and imports are equal, then trade is balanced, but
what happens when trade is out of balance and large trade surpluses or
deficits exist?<span id="bookmark782">‌</span></p>
<p>Germany, for example, has had substantial trade surpluses in recent
decades, in which exports have greatly exceeded imports. According to
the Central Intelligence Agency’s The World Factbook, in 2016, Germany
ran a trade surplus of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(295 billion. In contrast, the U.S. economy in
recent decades has experienced large trade deficits, in which imports
have considerably exceeded exports. In 2016, for example, U.S. imports
exceeded exports by \)</span>502 billion.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark783">A series of financial crises triggered by
unbalanced trade can lead economies into deep recessions. These crises
begin with large trade deficits. At some point, foreign investors become
pessimistic about the economy and move their money to other countries.
The economy then drops into deep recession, with real GDP often falling
up to 10% or more in a single year. This happened to Mexico in 1995 when
their GDP fell 8.1%. A number of countries in East Asia—Thailand, South
Korea, Malaysia, and Indonesia—succumbed to the same economic illness in
1997–1998 (called the Asian Financial Crisis). In the late 1990s and
into the early 2000s, Russia and Argentina had the identical experience.
What are the connections between imbalances of trade in goods and
services and the flows of international financial capital that set off
these economic avalanches?</span></p>
<p>We will start by examining the balance of trade in more detail, by
looking at some patterns of trade balances in the United States and
around the world. Then we will examine the intimate connection between
international flows of goods and services and international flows of
financial capital, which to economists are really just two sides of the
same coin. People often assume that trade surpluses like those in
Germany must be a positive sign for an economy, while trade deficits
like those in the United States must be harmful. As it turns out, both
trade surpluses and deficits can be either good or bad. We will see why
in this chapter.</p>

<p>A few decades ago, it was common to track the solid or physical
items that planes, trains, and trucks transported between countries
as a way of measuring the balance of trade. Economists call this
measurement is called the</p>
<p><span id="bookmark785">merchandise trade balance</span><span
class="p">. In most high-income economies, including the United
States, goods comprise less than half of a country’s total
production, while services comprise more than half. The last two
decades have seen a surge in international trade in services,
powered by technological advances in telecommunications and
computers that have made it possible to export or import customer
services, finance, law, advertising, management consulting,
software, construction engineering, and product design. Most global
trade still takes the form of goods rather than services, and the
government announces and the media prominently report the
merchandise trade balance. Old habits are hard to break. Economists,
however, typically rely on broader measures such as the balance of
trade or the </span>current account balance <span class="p">which
includes other international flows of income and foreign
aid.</span><span id="bookmark786">‌</span></p>
<p>Components of the U.S. Current Account Balance</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark787" class="a">Table 10.1</a> <span
class="p">breaks down the four main components of the U.S. current
account balance for the last quarter of 2015 (seasonally adjusted).
The first line shows the merchandise trade balance; that is, exports
and imports of goods. Because imports exceed exports, the trade
balance in the final column is negative, showing a merchandise trade
deficit. We can explain how the government collects this trade
information in the following Clear It Up feature.</span></p>

<p>How does the U.S. government collect trade statistics?</p>
<p><span id="bookmark788">Do not confuse the balance of trade (which
tracks imports and exports), with the current account balance, which
includes not just exports and imports, but also income from
investment and transfers.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark789">The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) within
the U.S. Department of Commerce compiles statistics on the balance
of trade using a variety of different sources. Merchandise importers
and exporters must file monthly documents with the Census Bureau,
which provides the basic data for tracking trade. To measure
international trade in services—which can happen over a telephone
line or computer network without shipping any physical goods—the BEA
carries out a set of surveys. Another set of BEA surveys tracks
investment flows, and there are even specific surveys to collect
travel information from U.S. residents visiting Canada and Mexico.
For measuring unilateral transfers, the BEA has access to official
U.S. government spending on aid, and then also carries out a survey
of charitable organizations that make foreign donations.</span></p>
<p>The BEA then cross-checks this information on international flows of
goods and capital against other available data. For example, the
Census Bureau also collects data from the shipping industry, which
it can use to check the data on trade in goods. All companies
involved in international flows of capital—including banks</p>
<p>Table 10.1 Components of the U.S. Current Account Balance for 2015
(in billions)</p>
<p>and companies making financial investments like stocks—must file
reports, which the U.S. Department of the Treasury ultimately
checks. The BEA also can cross check information on foreign trade by
looking at data collected by other countries on their foreign trade
with the United States, and also at the data collected by various
international organizations. Take these data sources, stir
carefully, and you have the U.S. balance of trade statistics. Much
of the statistics that we cite in this chapter come from these
sources.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark787" id="bookmark790" class="s34">The second row of</a>
<a href="#bookmark787" class="a">Table 10.1</a> <span
class="p">provides data on trade in services. Here, the U.S. economy
is running a surplus. Although the level of trade in services is
still relatively small compared to trade in goods, the importance of
services has expanded substantially over the last few decades. For
example, U.S. exports of services were equal to about one- half of
U.S. exports of goods in 2015, compared to one-fifth in 1980.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark791">The third component of the current account
balance, labeled “income payments,” refers to money that U.S.
financial investors received on their foreign investments (money
flowing into the United States) and payments to foreign investors
who had invested their funds here (money flowing out of the United
States). The reason for including this money on foreign investment
in the overall measure of trade, along with goods and services, is
that, from an economic perspective, income is just as much an
economic transaction as car, wheat, or oil shipments: it is just
trade that is happening in the financial capital market.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark792">The final category of the current account
balance is</span> <strong>unilateral transfers</strong>, which are payments that
government, private charities, or individuals make in which they
send money abroad without receiving any direct good or service.
Economic or military assistance from the U.S. government to other
countries fits into this category, as does spending abroad by
charities to address poverty or social inequalities. When an
individual in the United States sends money overseas, as is the case
with some immigrants, it is also counted in this category. The
current account balance treats these unilateral payments like
imports, because they also involve a stream of payments leaving the
country. For the</p>
<p>U.S. economy, unilateral transfers are almost always negative. This
pattern, however, does not always hold. In 1991, for example, when
the United States led an international coalition against Saddam
Hussein’s Iraq in the Gulf War, many other nations agreed that they
would make payments to the United States to offset the U.S. war
expenses. These payments were large enough that, in 1991, the
overall U.S. balance on unilateral transfers was a positive $10
billion.</p>

<p>Step 1. Focus on goods and services first. Enter the dollar amount
of exports of both goods and services under the Export column.</p>
<p>Step 2. Enter imports of goods and services under the Import column.</p>
<p>Step 3. Under the Export column and in the row for Income payments,
enter the financial flows of money coming back to the United States.
U.S. investors are earning this income from abroad.</p>
<p>Step 4. Under the Import column and in the row for Income payments,
enter the financial flows of money going out of the United States to
foreign investors. Foreign investors are earning this money on U.S.
assets, like stocks.</p>
<p>Step 5. Unilateral transfers are money flowing out of the United
States in the form of, for example, military aid, foreign aid, and
global charities. Because the money leaves the country, enter it
under Imports and in the final column as well, as a negative.</p>
<p>Step 6. Calculate the trade balance by subtracting imports from
exports in both goods and services. Enter this in the final Balance
column. This can be positive or negative.</p>
<p>Step 7. Subtract the income payments flowing out of the country
(under Imports) from the money coming back to the United States
(under Exports) and enter this amount under the Balance column.</p>
<p>Step 8. Enter unilateral transfers as a negative amount under the
Balance column.</p>
<p>Step 9. The merchandise trade balance is the difference between
exports of goods and imports of goods—the first number under
Balance.</p>
<p>Step 10. Now sum up your columns for Exports, Imports, and Balance.
The final balance number is the current account balance.</p>

<p><span id="bookmark796">Figure 10.2 Current Account Balance and
Merchandise Trade Balance, 1960–2015</span> <span class="s37">(a)
The current account balance and the merchandise trade balance in
billions of dollars from 1960 to 2015. If the lines are above zero
dollars, the United States was running a positive trade balance and
current account balance. If the lines fall below zero dollars, the
United States is running a trade deficit and a deficit in its
current account balance. (b) This shows the same items—trade balance
and current account balance—in relationship to the size of the U.S.
economy, or GDP, from 1960 to 2015.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark796" class="s34">By either measure, the U.S. balance of trade pattern is clear. From the 1960s into the 1970s, the U.S. economy had mostly small trade surpluses—that is, the graphs in</a>
<a href="#bookmark796" class="a">Figure 10.2</a> <span
class="p">show positive numbers. However, starting in the 1980s, the
trade deficit increased rapidly, and after a tiny surplus in 1991,
the current account trade deficit became even larger in the late
1990s and into the mid-2000s. However, the trade deficit declined in
2009 after the recession had taken hold, then rebounded partially in
2010 and has remained stable up through 2016.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark798" id="bookmark797" class="a">Table 10.4</a><span
class="s54"> </span>shows the U.S. trade picture in 2013 compared
with some other economies from around the world. While the U.S.
economy has consistently run trade deficits in recent years, Japan
and many European nations, among them France and Germany, have
consistently run trade surpluses. Some of the other countries listed
include Brazil, the largest economy in Latin America; Nigeria, along
with South Africa competing to be the largest economy in Africa; and
China, India, and Korea. The first column offers one measure of an
economy’s globalization: <strong>exports of goods and services as a
percentage of GDP</strong>. The second column shows the trade balance.
Usually, most countries have trade surpluses or deficits that are
less than 5% of GDP. As you can see, the U.S. current account
balance is –2.6% of GDP, while Germany’s is 8.4% of GDP.</p>

<p><span id="bookmark800">As economists see it, trade surpluses can be
either good or bad, depending on circumstances, and trade deficits
can be good or bad, too. The challenge is to understand how the
international flows of goods and services are connected with
international flows of</span> <strong>financial capital</strong>. In this module
we will illustrate the intimate connection between trade balances
and flows of financial capital in two ways: a parable of trade
between Robinson Crusoe and Friday, and a circular flow diagram
representing flows of trade and payments.</p>
<p>A Two-Person Economy: Robinson Crusoe and Friday</p>
<p>To understand how economists view trade deficits and surpluses,
consider a parable based on the story of Robinson Crusoe. Crusoe, as
you may remember from the classic novel by Daniel Defoe first
published in 1719, was</p>
<p>shipwrecked on a desert island. After living alone for some time, he
is joined by a second person, whom he names Friday. Think about the
balance of trade in a two-person economy like that of Robinson and
Friday.</p>
<p>Robinson and Friday trade goods and services. Perhaps Robinson
catches fish and trades them to Friday for coconuts, or Friday
weaves a hat out of tree fronds and trades it to Robinson for help
in carrying water. For a period of time, each individual trade is
self-contained and complete. Because each trade is voluntary, both
Robinson and Friday must feel that they are receiving fair value for
what they are giving. As a result, each person’s exports are always
equal to his imports, and trade is always in balance between the
two. Neither person experiences either a trade deficit or a trade
surplus.</p>
<p>However, one day Robinson approaches Friday with a proposition.
Robinson wants to dig ditches for an irrigation system for his
garden, but he knows that if he starts this project, he will not
have much time left to fish and gather coconuts to feed himself each
day. He proposes that Friday supply him with a certain number of
fish and coconuts for several months, and then after that time, he
promises to repay Friday out of the extra produce that he will be
able to grow in his irrigated garden. If Friday accepts this offer,
then a trade imbalance comes into being. For several months, Friday
will have a trade surplus: that is, he is exporting to Robinson more
than he is importing. More precisely, he is giving Robinson fish and
coconuts, and at least for the moment, he is receiving nothing in
return. Conversely, Robinson will have a trade deficit, because he
is importing more from Friday than he is exporting.</p>
<p>This parable raises several useful issues in thinking about what a
trade deficit and a trade surplus really mean in economic terms. The
first issue that this story of Robinson and Friday raises is this:
Is it better to have a trade surplus or a trade deficit? The answer,
as in any voluntary market interaction, is that if both parties
agree to the transaction, then they may both be better off. Over
time, if Robinson’s irrigated garden is a success, it is certainly
possible that both Robinson and Friday can benefit from this
agreement.</p>
<p>The parable raises a second issue: What can go wrong? Robinson’s
proposal to Friday introduces an element of uncertainty. Friday is,
in effect, making a loan of fish and coconuts to Robinson, and
Friday’s happiness with this arrangement will depend on whether
Robinson repays that loan as planned, in full and on time. Perhaps
Robinson spends several months loafing and never builds the
irrigation system, or perhaps Robinson has been too optimistic about
how much he will be able to grow with the new irrigation system,
which turns out not to be very productive. Perhaps, after building
the irrigation system, Robinson decides that he does not want to
repay Friday as much as he previously agreed. Any of these
developments will prompt a new round of negotiations between Friday
and Robinson. Why the repayment failed is likely to shape Friday’s
attitude toward these renegotiations. If Robinson worked very hard
and the irrigation system just did not increase production as
intended, Friday may have some sympathy. If Robinson loafed or if he
just refuses to pay, Friday may become irritated.</p>
<p>A third issue that the parable raises is that an intimate
relationship exists between a trade deficit and international
borrowing, and between a trade surplus and international lending.
The size of Friday’s trade surplus is exactly how much he is lending
to Robinson. The size of Robinson’s trade deficit is exactly how
much he is borrowing from Friday. To economists, a trade surplus
literally means the same thing as an outflow of financial capital,
and a trade deficit literally means the same thing as an inflow of
financial capital. This last insight is worth exploring in greater
detail, which we will do in the following section.</p>

<p>Table 10.5</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark802" class="s84">Step 1. Observe from</a>
<a href="#bookmark802" class="s43">Table 10.5</a> <span
class="s37">that, in the United States, it takes eight hours to
supply a bushel of wheat and nine hours to supply a yard of cloth.
In contrast, it takes four hours to supply a bushel of wheat and
three hours to supply a yard of cloth in Britain.</span></p>
<p>Step 2. Recognize the difference between absolute advantage and
comparative advantage. Britain has an absolute advantage (lowest
cost) in each good, since it takes a lower amount of labor to make
each good in Britain. Britain also has a comparative advantage in
the production of cloth (lower opportunity cost in cloth (3/ 4
versus 9/8)). The United States has a comparative advantage in wheat
production (lower opportunity cost of 8/9 versus 4/3).</p>
<p>Step 3. Determine the relative price of one good in terms of the
other good. The price of wheat, in this example, is the amount of
cloth you have to give up. To find this price, convert the hours per
unit of wheat and cloth into units per hour. To do so, observe that
in the United States it takes eight hours to make a bushel of wheat,
so workers can process 1/8 of a bushel of wheat in an hour. It takes
nine hours to make a yard of cloth in the United States, so workers
can produce 1/9 of a yard of cloth in an hour. If you divide the
amount of cloth (1/9 of a yard) by the amount of wheat you give up
(1/8 of a bushel) in an hour, you find the price (8/9) of one good
(wheat) in terms of the other (cloth).</p>
<p>The Balance of Trade as the Balance of Payments</p>
<p><span id="bookmark803">The connection between trade balances and
international flows of financial capital is so close that economists
sometimes describe the balance of trade as the balance of payments.
Each category of the current account balance involves a
corresponding flow of payments between a given country and the rest
of the world economy.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark805" class="a">Figure 10.3</a> <span
class="p">shows the flow of goods and services and payments between
one country—the United States in this example—and the rest of the
world. The top line shows U.S. exports of goods and services, while
the second line shows financial payments from purchasers in other
countries back to the U.S. economy. The third line then shows</span></p>
<p>U.S. imports of goods, services, and investment, and the fourth line
shows payments from the home economy to the rest of the world. Flow
of goods and services (lines one and three) show up in the current
account, while we find flow of funds (lines two and four) in the
financial account.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark805" id="bookmark804" class="s34">The bottom four lines in</a>

bottom lines, we see investments made abroad with funds flowing from
the home country to the rest of the world. Investment income
stemming from an investment abroad then runs in the other direction
from the rest of the world to the home country. Similarly, we see on
the bottom third line, an investment from the rest of the world into
the home country and investment income (bottom fourth line) flowing
from the home country to the rest of the world. We find the
investment income (bottom lines two and four) in the current
account, while investment to the rest of the world or into the home
country (lines one and three) is in the financial account. This
figure does not show unilateral transfers, the fourth item in the
current account.</span></p>

<p><span id="bookmark805">Figure 10.3 Flow of Investment Goods and
Capital</span> <span class="s37">Each element of the current account
balance involves a flow of financial payments between countries. The
top line shows exports of goods and services leaving the home
country; the second line shows the money that the home country
receives for those exports. The third line shows imports that the
home country receives; the fourth line shows the payments that the
home country sent abroad in exchange for these imports.</span></p>
<p>A current account deficit means that, the country is a net borrower
from abroad. Conversely, a positive current account balance means a
country is a net lender to the rest of the world. Just like the
parable of Robinson and Friday, the lesson is that a trade surplus
means an overall outflow of financial investment capital, as
domestic investors put their funds abroad, while a deficit in the
current account balance is exactly equal to the overall or net
inflow of foreign investment capital from abroad.</p>
<p>It is important to recognize that an inflow and outflow of foreign
capital does not necessarily refer to a debt that governments owe to
other governments, although government debt may be part of the
picture. Instead, these international flows of financial capital
refer to all of the ways in which private investors in one country
may invest in another country—by buying real estate, companies, and
financial investments like stocks and bonds.</p>

<li><p>Identify and calculate supply and demand for financial capital</p></li>

<li><p>Predict the rising and falling of trade deficits based on a

</ul>
<p>The close connection between trade balances and international flows
of savings and investments leads to a macroeconomic analysis. This
approach views trade balances—and their associated flows of
financial capital—in the context of the overall levels of savings
and financial investment in the economy.</p>
<p>Understanding the Determinants of the Trade and Current Account
Balance</p>
<p><span id="bookmark807">The</span> <strong>national saving and investment
identity</strong> provides a useful way to understand the determinants of
the trade and current account balance. In a nation’s financial
capital market, the quantity of financial capital supplied at any
given time must equal the quantity of financial capital demanded for
purposes of making investments. What is on the supply and demand
sides of financial capital? See the following Clear It Up feature
for the answer to this question.<span id="bookmark808">‌</span></p>
<p>What comprises the supply and demand of financial capital?</p>
<p>A country’s national savings is the total of its domestic savings by
household and companies (private savings) as well as the government
(public savings). If a country is running a trade deficit, it means
money from abroad is entering the country and the government
considers it part of the supply of financial capital.</p>
<p>The demand for financial capital (money) represents groups that are
borrowing the money. Businesses need to borrow to finance their
investments in factories, materials, and personnel. When the federal
government runs a budget deficit, it is also borrowing money from
investors by selling Treasury bonds. Therefore, both business
investment and the federal government can demand (or borrow) the
supply of savings.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_234.png" width="624" height="51" alt="image" />
<p>There are two main sources for the supply of financial capital in
the U.S. economy: saving by individuals and firms, called S, and the
inflow of financial capital from foreign investors, which is equal
to the trade deficit (M – X), or imports minus exports. There are
also two main sources of demand for financial capital in the U.S.
economy: private sector investment, I, and government borrowing,
where the government needs to borrow when government spending, G, is
higher than the taxes collected, T. We can express this national
savings and investment identity in algebraic terms:</p>
<p>Supply of financial capital = Demand for financial capital S + (M
– X) = I + (G – T)</p>
<p>Again, in this equation, S is private savings, T is taxes, G is
government spending, M is imports, X is exports, and I is
investment. This relationship is true as a matter of definition
because, for the macro economy, the quantity supplied of financial
capital must be equal to the quantity demanded.</p>
<p>However, certain components of the national savings and investment
identity can switch between the supply side and the demand side.
Some countries, like the United States in most years since the
1970s, have budget deficits, which mean the government is spending
more than it collects in taxes, and so the government needs to
borrow funds. In this case, the government term would be G – T &gt;
0, showing that spending is larger than taxes, and the government
would be a demander of financial capital on the left-hand side of
the equation (that is, a borrower), not a supplier of financial
capital on the right-hand side. However, if the government runs a
budget surplus so that the taxes exceed spending, as the U.S.
government did from 1998 to 2001, then the government in that year
was contributing to the supply of financial capital (T – G &gt; 0),
and would appear on the left (saving) side of the national savings
and investment identity.</p>
<p>Similarly, if a national economy runs a trade surplus, the trade
sector will involve an outflow of financial capital to other
countries. A trade surplus means that the domestic financial capital
is in surplus within a country and can be invested in other
countries.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark809">The fundamental notion that total quantity of
financial capital demanded equals total quantity of financial
capital supplied must always remain true. Domestic savings will
always appear as part of the supply of financial capital and
domestic investment will always appear as part of the demand for
financial capital. However, the government and trade balance
elements of the equation can move back and forth as either suppliers
or demanders of financial capital, depending on whether government
budgets and the trade balance are in surplus or deficit.</span></p>
<p>Domestic Saving and Investment Determine the Trade Balance</p>
<p>One insight from the national saving and investment identity is that
a nation’s own levels of domestic saving and investment determine a
nation’s balance of trade. To understand this point, rearrange the
identity to put the balance of trade all by itself on one side of
the equation. Consider first the situation with a trade deficit, and
then the situation with a trade surplus.</p>
<p>In the case of a trade deficit, the national saving and investment
identity can be rewritten as:</p>
<p>Trade deficit = Domestic investment – Private domestic saving –
Government (or public) savings (M – X) = I – S – (T – G)</p>
<p>In this case, domestic investment is higher than domestic saving,
including both private and government saving. The</p>
<p>only way that domestic investment can exceed domestic saving is if
capital is flowing into a country from abroad. After all, that extra
financial capital for investment has to come from someplace.</p>
<p>Now consider a trade <em>surplus</em> from the standpoint of the national
saving and investment identity:</p>
<p>Trade surplus = Private domestic saving + Public saving – Domestic
investment (X – M) = S + (T – G) – I</p>
<p>In this case, domestic savings (both private and public) is higher
than domestic investment. That extra financial capital will be
invested abroad.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1659" class="s34">This connection of domestic saving and investment to the trade balance explains why economists view the balance of trade as a fundamentally macroeconomic phenomenon. As the national saving and investment identity shows, the performance of certain sectors of an economy, like cars or steel, do not determine the trade balance. Further, whether the nation’s trade laws and regulations encourage free trade or protectionism also does not determine the trade balance (see</a>
<a href="#bookmark1659" class="a">Globalization and</a>
Protectionism<span class="p">).</span></p>
<p>Exploring Trade Balances One Factor at a Time</p>
<p>The national saving and investment identity also provides a
framework for thinking about what will cause trade deficits to rise
or fall. Begin with the version of the identity that has domestic
savings and investment on the left and the trade deficit on the
right:</p>
<p>Domestic investment – Private domestic savings – Public domestic
savings = Trade deficit</p>
<p>I – S – (T – G) = (M – X)</p>
<p>Now, consider the factors on the left-hand side of the equation one
at a time, while holding the other factors constant.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark810" class="s34">As a first example, assume that the level of domestic investment in a country rises, while the level of private and public saving remains unchanged.</a>
<a href="#bookmark810" class="a">Table 10.6</a> <span
class="p">shows the result in the first row under the equation.
Since the equality of the national savings and investment identity
must continue to hold—it is, after all, an identity that must be
true by definition—the rise in domestic investment will mean a
higher trade deficit. This situation occurred in the U.S. economy in
the late 1990s. Because of the surge of new information and
communications technologies that became available, business
investment increased substantially. A fall in private saving during
this time and a rise in government saving more or less offset each
other. As a result, the financial capital to fund that business
investment came from abroad, which is one reason for the very high
U.S. trade deficits of the late 1990s and early 2000s.</span></p>

<p>Table 10.6 Causes of a Changing Trade Balance</p>
<p>As a second scenario, assume that the level of domestic savings
rises, while the level of domestic investment and public savings
remain unchanged. In this case, the trade deficit would decline. As
domestic savings rises, there would be less need for foreign
financial capital to meet investment needs. For this reason, a
policy proposal often made for reducing the U.S. trade deficit is to
increase private saving—although exactly how to increase the overall
rate of saving has proven controversial.</p>
<p>As a third scenario, imagine that the government budget deficit
increased dramatically, while domestic investment</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_235.png" width="624" height="625" alt="image" />
<p>and private savings remained unchanged. This scenario occurred in
the U.S. economy in the mid-1980s. The federal budget deficit
increased from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(79 billion in 1981 to \)</span>221 billion in 1986—an
increase in the demand for financial capital of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(142 billion. The
current account balance collapsed from a surplus of \)</span>5 billion in
1981 to a deficit of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(147 billion in 1986—an increase in the supply
of financial capital from abroad of \)</span>152 billion. The connection at
that time is clear: a sharp increase in government borrowing
increased the U.S. economy’s demand for financial capital, and
foreign investors through the trade deficit primarily supplied that
increase. The following Work It Out feature walks you through a
scenario in which private domestic savings has to rise by a certain
amount to reduce a trade deficit.</p>
<p>Solving Problems with the Saving and Investment Identity</p>
<p>Use the saving and investment identity to answer the following
question: Country A has a trade deficit of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(200 billion, private
domestic savings of \)</span>500 billion, a government deficit of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(200
billion, and private domestic investment of \)</span>500 billion. To reduce
the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(200 billion trade deficit by \)</span>100 billion, by how much does
private domestic savings have to increase?</p>
<p>Step 1. Write out the savings investment formula solving for the
trade deficit or surplus on the left:</p>
<p>(X – M) = S + (T – G) – I</p>
<p>Step 2. In the formula, put the amount for the trade deficit in as a
negative number (X – M). The left side of your formula is now:</p>
<p>–200 = S + (T – G) – I</p>
<p>Step 3. Enter the private domestic savings (S) of $500 in the
formula:</p>
<p>–200 = 500 + (T – G) – I</p>
<p>Step 4. Enter the private domestic investment (I) of $500 into the
formula:</p>
<p>–200 = 500+ (T – G) – 500</p>
<p>Step 5. The government budget surplus or balance is represented by
(T – G). Enter a budget deficit amount for (T – G) of –200:</p>
<p>Step 6. Your formula now is:</p>
<p>–200 = 500 + (–200) – 500</p>
<p>(X – M) = S + (T – G) – I</p>
<p>–200 = 500 + (–200) – 500</p>
<p>The question is: To reduce your trade deficit (X – M) of –200 to
–100 (in billions of dollars), by how much will savings have to
rise?</p>
<p>(X – M) = S + (T – G) – I</p>
<p>–100 = S + (–200) – 500</p>
<p>600 = S</p>
<p>Step 7. Summarize the answer: Private domestic savings needs to rise
by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(100 billion, to a total of \)</span>600 billion, for the two sides of
the equation to remain equal (–100 = –100).</p>
<p>Short-Term Movements in the Business Cycle and the Trade Balance</p>
<p>In the short run, whether an economy is in a recession or on the
upswing can affect trade imbalances. A recession tends to make a
trade deficit smaller, or a trade surplus larger, while a period of
strong economic growth tends to make a trade deficit larger, or a
trade surplus smaller.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark796" class="s34">As an example, note in</a>
<a href="#bookmark796" class="a">Figure 10.2</a> <span
class="p">that the U.S. trade deficit declined by almost half from
2006 to 2009. One primary reason for this change is that during the
recession, as the U.S. economy slowed down, it purchased fewer of
all goods, including fewer imports from abroad. However, buying
power abroad fell less, and so U.S. exports did not</span></p>
<p>fall by as much.</p>
<p>Conversely, in the mid-2000s, when the U.S. trade deficit became
very large, a contributing short-term reason is that the U.S.
economy was growing. As a result, there was considerable aggressive
buying in the U.S. economy, including the buying of imports. Thus, a
trade deficit (or a much lower trade surplus) often accompanies a
rapidly growing domestic economy, while a trade surplus (or a much
lower trade deficit) accompanies a slowing or recessionary domestic
economy.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark811">When the trade deficit rises, it necessarily
means a greater net inflow of foreign financial capital. The
national saving and investment identity teaches that the rest of the
economy can absorb this inflow of foreign financial capital in
several different ways. For example, reduced private savings could
offset the additional inflow of financial capital from abroad,
leaving domestic investment and public saving unchanged.
Alternatively, the inflow of foreign financial capital could result
in higher domestic investment, leaving private and public saving
unchanged. Yet another possibility is that greater government
borrowing could absorb the inflow of foreign financial capital,
leaving domestic saving and investment unchanged. The national
saving and investment identity does not specify which of these
scenarios, alone or in combination, will occur—only that one of them
must occur.</span></p>

Pros and Cons of Trade Deficits and Surpluses</span><span

<p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Identify three ways in which borrowing money or running a trade
deficit can result in a healthy economy</p></li>
<li><p>Identify three ways in which borrowing money or running a trade
deficit can result in a weaker economy</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Because flows of trade always involve flows of financial payments,
flows of international trade are actually the same as flows of
international financial capital. The question of whether trade
deficits or surpluses are good or bad for an economy is, in economic
terms, exactly the same question as whether it is a good idea for an
economy to rely on net inflows of financial capital from abroad or
to make net investments of financial capital abroad. Conventional
wisdom often holds that borrowing money is foolhardy, and that a
prudent country, like a prudent person, should always rely on its
own resources. While it is certainly possible to borrow too much—as
anyone with an overloaded credit card can testify—borrowing at
certain times can also make sound economic sense. For both
individuals and countries, there is no economic merit in a policy of
abstaining from participation in financial capital markets.</p>
<p>It makes economic sense to borrow when you are buying something with
a long-run payoff; that is, when you are making an investment. For
this reason, it can make economic sense to borrow for a college
education, because the education will typically allow you to earn
higher wages, and so to repay the loan and still come out ahead. It
can also make sense for a business to borrow in order to purchase a
machine that will last 10 years, as long as the machine will
increase output and profits by more than enough to repay the loan.
Similarly, it can make economic sense for a national economy to
borrow from abroad, as long as it wisely invests the money in ways
that will tend to raise the nation’s economic growth over time.
Then, it will be possible for the national economy to repay the
borrowed money over time and still end up better off than before.</p>
<p>One vivid example of a country that borrowed heavily from abroad,
invested wisely, and did perfectly well is the United States during
the nineteenth century. The United States ran a trade deficit in 40
of the 45 years from 1831 to 1875, which meant that it was importing
capital from abroad over that time. However, that financial capital
was mostly invested in projects like railroads that brought a
substantial economic payoff. (See the following Clear It Up feature
for more on this.)</p>
<p>A more recent example along these lines is the experience of South
Korea, which had trade deficits during much of the 1970s—and so was
an importer of capital over that time. However, South Korea also had
high rates of investment in physical plant and equipment, and its
economy grew rapidly. From the mid-1980s into the mid-1990s, South
Korea often had trade surpluses—that is, it was repaying its past
borrowing by sending capital abroad.</p>
<p>In contrast, some countries have run large trade deficits, borrowed
heavily in global capital markets, and ended up in all kinds of
trouble. Two specific sorts of trouble are worth examining. First, a
borrower nation can find itself in a bind if it does not invest the
incoming funds from abroad in a way that leads to increased
productivity. Several of</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_236.png" width="624" height="51" alt="image" />
<p>Are trade deficits always harmful?</p>
<p>For most years of the nineteenth century, U.S. imports exceeded
exports and the U.S. economy had a trade deficit. Yet the string of
trade deficits did not hold back the economy at all. Instead, the
trade deficits contributed to the strong economic growth that gave
the U.S. economy the highest per capita GDP in the world by
around 1900.</p>
<p>The U.S. trade deficits meant that the U.S. economy was receiving a
net inflow of foreign capital from abroad. Much of that foreign
capital flowed into two areas of investment—railroads and public
infrastructure like roads, water systems, and schools—which were
important to helping the U.S. economy grow.</p>
<p>We should not overstate the effect of foreign investment capital on
U.S. economic growth. In most years the foreign financial capital
represented no more than 6–10% of the funds that the government used
for overall physical investment in the economy. Nonetheless, the
trade deficit and the accompanying investment funds from abroad were
clearly a help, not a hindrance, to the U.S. economy in the
nineteenth century.</p>
<p>Latin America’s large economies, including Mexico and Brazil, ran
large trade deficits and borrowed heavily from abroad in the 1970s,
but the inflow of financial capital did not boost productivity
sufficiently, which meant that these countries faced enormous
troubles repaying the money borrowed when economic conditions
shifted during the 1980s. Similarly, it appears that a number of
African nations that borrowed foreign funds in the 1970s and 1980s
did not invest in productive economic assets. As a result, several
of those countries later faced large interest payments, with no
economic growth to show for the borrowed funds.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1483" id="bookmark813" class="s34">A second “trouble” is: What happens if the foreign money flows in, and then suddenly flows out again? We raised this scenario at the start of the chapter. In the mid-1990s, a number of countries in East Asia—Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, and South Korea—ran large trade deficits and imported capital from abroad. However, in 1997 and 1998 many foreign investors became concerned about the health of these economies, and quickly pulled their money out of stock and bond markets, real estate, and banks. The extremely rapid departure of that foreign capital staggered the banking systems and economies of these countries, plunging them into deep recession. We investigate and discuss the links between international capital flows, banks, and recession in</a>

style=" color: #000;">on whether or not trade deficit is good for
the economy.</span></p>
<p>While a trade deficit is not always harmful, there is no guarantee
that running a trade surplus will bring robust economic health. For
example, Germany and Japan ran substantial trade surpluses for most
of the last three decades. Regardless of their persistent trade
surpluses, both countries have experienced occasional recessions and
neither country has had especially robust annual growth in recent
years. Read more about Japan’s trade surplus in the next Clear It Up
feature.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_238.png" width="624" height="51" alt="image" />
<p>Are trade surpluses always beneficial? Considering Japan since the
1990s.</p>
<p>Perhaps no economy around the world is better known for its trade
surpluses than Japan. Since 1990, the size of these surpluses has
often been near $100 billion per year. When Japan’s economy was
growing vigorously in the 1960s and 1970s, many, especially
non-economists, described its large trade surpluses either a cause
or a result of its robust economic health. However, from a
standpoint of economic growth, Japan’s economy has been teetering in
and out of recession since 1990, with real GDP growth averaging only
about 1% per year, and an unemployment rate that has been creeping
higher. Clearly, a whopping trade surplus is no guarantee of
economic good health.</p>
<p>Instead, Japan’s trade surplus reflects that Japan has a very high
rate of domestic savings, more than the Japanese economy can invest
domestically, and so it invests the extra funds abroad. In Japan’s
slow economy, consumption of imports is relatively low, and the
growth of consumption is relatively slow. Thus, Japan’s exports
continually exceed its imports, leaving the trade surplus
continually high. Recently, Japan’s trade surpluses began to
deteriorate. In 2013, Japan ran a trade deficit due to the high cost
of imported oil. By 2015, Japan again had a surplus.</p>
<p>The sheer size and persistence of the U.S. trade deficits and
inflows of foreign capital since the 1980s are a legitimate cause
for concern. The huge U.S. economy will not be destabilized by an
outflow of international capital as easily as, say, the
comparatively tiny economies of Thailand and Indonesia were in
1997–1998. Even an economy that is not knocked down, however, can
still be shaken. American policymakers should certainly be paying
attention to those cases where a pattern of extensive and sustained
current account deficits and foreign borrowing has gone badly—if
only as a cautionary tale.</p>

Difference between Level of Trade and the Trade Balance</span><span
id="bookmark814">‌</span><span id="bookmark815">‌</span></p>
<p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Identify three factors that influence a country’s level of trade</p></li>
<li><p>Differentiate between balance of trade and level of trade</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span id="bookmark816">A nation’s</span> <em>level</em> of trade may at
first sound like much the same issue as the <em>balance</em>
<a href="#bookmark784" class="s34">of trade, but these two are actually quite separate. It is perfectly possible for a country to have a very high level of trade—measured by its exports of goods and services as a share of its GDP—while it also has a near-balance between exports and imports. A high level of trade indicates that the nation exports a good portion of its production. It is also possible for a country’s trade to be a relatively low share of GDP, relative to global averages, but for the imbalance between its exports and its imports to be quite large. We emphasized this general theme earlier in</a>
<a href="#bookmark784" class="a">Measuring Trade</a> <span
class="s54">Balances</span>, which offered some illustrative figures
on trade levels and balances.</p>
<p>A country’s level of trade tells how much of its production it
exports. We measure this by the percent of exports out of GDP. It
indicates the degree of an economy’s globalization. Some countries,
such as Germany, have a high level of trade—they export almost 50%
of their total production. The balance of trade tells us if the
country is running a trade surplus or trade deficit. A country can
have a low level of trade but a high trade deficit. (For example,
the United States only exports 13% of GDP, but it has a trade
deficit of over $500 billion.)</p>
<p>Three factors strongly influence a nation’s level of trade: the size
of its economy, its geographic location, and its history of trade.
Large economies like the United States can do much of their trading
internally, while small economies like Sweden have less ability to
provide what they want internally and tend to have higher ratios of
exports and imports to GDP. Nations that are neighbors tend to trade
more, since costs of transportation and communication</p>
<p>are lower. Moreover, some nations have long and established patterns
of international trade, while others do not.</p>
<p>Consequently, a relatively small economy like Sweden, with many
nearby trading partners across Europe and a long history of foreign
trade, has a high level of trade. Brazil and India, which are fairly
large economies that have often sought to inhibit trade in recent
decades, have lower levels of trade; whereas, the United States and
Japan are extremely large economies that have comparatively few
nearby trading partners. Both countries actually have quite low
levels of trade by world standards. The ratio of exports to GDP in
either the United States or in Japan is about half of the world
average.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark817">The balance of trade is a separate issue from
the level of trade. The United States has a low level of trade, but
had enormous trade deficits for most years from the mid-1980s into
the 2000s. Japan has a low level of trade by world standards, but
has typically shown large trade surpluses in recent decades. Nations
like Germany and the United Kingdom have medium to high levels of
trade by world standards, but Germany had a moderate trade surplus
in 2015, while the United Kingdom had a moderate trade deficit.
Their trade picture was roughly in balance in the late 1990s. Sweden
had a high level of trade and a moderate trade surplus in 2015,
while Mexico had a high level of trade and a moderate trade deficit
that same year.</span></p>

<p>Are trade surpluses always beneficial? Considering Colonial India.</p>
<p>India was formally under British rule from 1858 to 1947. During that
time, India consistently had trade surpluses with Great Britain.
Anyone who believes that trade surpluses are a sign of economic
strength and dominance while trade deficits are a sign of economic
weakness must find this pattern odd, since it would mean that
colonial India was successfully dominating and exploiting Great
Britain for almost a century—which was not true.</p>
<p>Instead, India’s trade surpluses with Great Britain meant that each
year there was an overall flow of financial capital from India to
Great Britain. In India, many heavily criticized this financial
capital flow as the “drain,” and they viewed eliminating the
financial capital drain as one of the many reasons why India would
benefit from achieving independence.</p>
<p>In short, it is quite possible for nations with a relatively low
level of trade, expressed as a percentage of GDP, to have relatively
large trade deficits. It is also quite possible for nations with a
near balance between exports and imports to worry about the
consequences of high levels of trade for the economy. It is not
inconsistent to believe that a high level of trade is potentially
beneficial to an economy, because of the way it allows nations to
play to their comparative advantages, and to also be concerned about
any macroeconomic instability caused by a long-term pattern of large
trade deficits. The following Clear It Up feature discusses how this
sort of dynamic played out in Colonial India.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts about Trade Balances</p>
<p>Trade deficits can be a good or a bad sign for an economy, and trade
surpluses can be a good or a bad sign. Even a trade balance of
zero—which just means that a nation is neither a net borrower nor
lender in the international economy—can be either a good or bad
sign. The fundamental economic question is not whether a nation’s
economy is borrowing or lending at all, but whether the particular
borrowing or lending in the particular economic conditions of that
country makes sense.</p>
<p>It is interesting to reflect on how public attitudes toward trade
deficits and surpluses might change if we could somehow change the
labels that people and the news media affix to them. If we called a
trade deficit “attracting foreign financial capital”—which
accurately describes what a trade deficit means—then trade deficits
might look more attractive. Conversely, if we called a trade surplus
“shipping financial capital abroad”—which accurately captures what a
trade surplus does—then trade surpluses might look less attractive.
Either way, the key to understanding trade balances is to understand
the relationships between flows of trade and flows of international
payments, and what these relationships imply about the causes,
benefits, and risks of different kinds of trade balances. The first
step along this journey of understanding is to move beyond knee-jerk
reactions to terms like “trade surplus,”</p>

<p>More than Meets the Eye in the Congo</p>
<p>Now that you see the big picture, you undoubtedly realize that all
of the economic choices you make, such as depositing savings or
investing in an international mutual fund, do influence the flow of
goods and services as well as the flows of money around the world.</p>
<p>You now know that a trade surplus does not necessarily tell us
whether an economy is performing well or not. The Democratic
Republic of the Congo ran a trade surplus in 2013, as we learned in
the beginning of the chapter. Yet its current account balance was
–$2.8 billion. However, the return of political stability and the
rebuilding in the aftermath of the civil war there has meant a flow
of investment and financial capital into the country. In this case,
a negative current account balance means the country is being
rebuilt—and that is a good thing.</p>

<p>KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY</p>
<ol>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark784" class="a">Measuring Trade</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark784">Balances</a></p>
<p>The trade balance measures the gap between a country’s exports
and its imports. In most high-income economies, goods comprise
less than half of a country’s total production, while services
comprise more than half. The last two decades have seen a surge
in international trade in services; however, most global trade
still takes the form of goods rather than services. The current
account balance includes the trade in goods, services, and money
flowing into and out of a country from investments and
unilateral transfers.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark795" class="a">Trade Balances in Historical and International</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark795">Context</a></p>
<p>The United States developed large trade surpluses in the early
1980s, swung back to a tiny trade surplus in 1991, and then had
even larger trade deficits in the late 1990s and early 2000s. As
we will see below, a trade deficit necessarily means a net
inflow of financial capital from abroad, while a trade surplus
necessarily means a net outflow of financial capital from an
economy to other countries.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark799" class="a">Trade Balances and Flows of Financial</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark799">Capital</a></p>
<p>International flows of goods and services are closely connected
to the international flows of financial capital. A current
account deficit means that, after taking all the flows of
payments from goods, services, and income together, the country
is a net borrower from the rest of the world. A current account
surplus is the opposite and means the country is a net lender to
the rest of the world.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark806" class="a">The National Saving and Investment</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark806">Identity</a></p>
<p>The national saving and investment identity is based on the
relationship that the total quantity of financial capital
supplied from all sources must equal the total quantity of
financial capital demanded from all sources. If S is private
saving, T is taxes, G is government spending, M is imports, X is
exports, and I is investment, then for an economy with a current
account deficit and a budget deficit:</p>
<p>Supply of financial capital = Demand for financial capital S +
(M – X) = I + (G – T)</p>
<p>A recession tends to increase the trade balance (meaning a
higher trade surplus or lower trade deficit), while economic
boom will tend to decrease the trade balance (meaning a lower
trade surplus or a larger trade deficit).</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark812" class="a">The Pros and Cons of Trade Deficits and</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark812">Surpluses</a></p>
<p>Trade surpluses are no guarantee of economic health, and trade
deficits are no guarantee of economic weakness. Either trade
deficits or trade surpluses can work out well or poorly,
depending on whether a government wisely invests the
corresponding flows of financial capital.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark814" class="a">The Difference between Level of Trade and the Trade</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark814">Balance</a></p></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There is a difference between the level of a country’s trade and the
balance of trade. The government measures its level of trade by the
percentage of exports out of GDP, or the size of the economy. Small
economies that have nearby trading partners and a history of
international trade will tend to have higher levels of trade. Larger
economies with few nearby trading partners and a limited history of
international trade will tend to have lower levels of trade. The level
of trade is different from the trade balance. The level of trade depends
on a country’s history of trade, its geography, and the size of its
economy. A country’s balance of trade is the dollar difference between
its exports and imports.</p>
<p>Trade deficits and trade surpluses are not necessarily good or bad—it
depends on the circumstances. Even if a country is borrowing, if it
invests that money in productivity-boosting investments it can lead to
an improvement in long-term economic growth.</p>

<p>From Housing Bubble to Housing Bust</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark857" class="s84">The United States experienced rising home ownership rates for most of the last two decades. Between 1990 and 2006, the U.S. housing market grew. Homeownership rates grew from 64% to a high of over 69% between 2004 and 2005. For many people, this was a period in which they could either buy first homes or buy a larger and more expensive home. During this time mortgage values tripled. Housing became more accessible to Americans and was considered to be a safe financial investment.</a>

<span class="s37">From the early 1990s up through 2005, the number of
new single family houses sold rose steadily. In 2006, the number dropped
dramatically and this dramatic decline continued through 2011. By 2014,
the number of new houses sold had begun to climb back up, but the levels
are still lower than those of 1990. (Source: U.S. Census Bureau)</span></p>
<p>The housing bubble began to show signs of bursting in 2005, as
delinquency and late payments began to grow and an oversupply of new
homes on the market became apparent. Dropping home values contributed to
a decrease in the overall wealth of the household sector and caused
homeowners to pull back on spending. Several mortgage lenders were
forced to file for bankruptcy because homeowners were not making their
payments, and by 2008 the problem had spread throughout the financial
markets. Lenders clamped down on credit and the housing bubble burst.
Financial markets were now in crisis and unable or unwilling to even
extend credit to credit-worthy customers.</p>
<p>The housing bubble and the crisis in the financial markets were major
contributors to the Great Recession that led to unemployment rates over
10% and falling GDP. While the United States is still recovering from
the impact of the Great Recession, it has made substantial progress in
restoring financial market stability through implementing aggressive
fiscal and monetary policy.</p>
<p>The economic history of the United States is cyclical in nature with
recessions and expansions. Some of these fluctuations are severe, such
as the economic downturn that occurred during the Great Depression in
the 1930s which lasted several years. Why does the economy grow at
different rates in different years? What are the causes of the cyclical
behavior of the economy? This chapter will introduce an important model,
the aggregate demand–aggregate supply model, to begin our understanding
of why economies expand and contract over time.</p>

<p><span id="bookmark858">A key part of macroeconomics is the use of models
to analyze macro issues and problems. How is the rate of economic growth
connected to changes in the unemployment rate? Is there a reason why
unemployment and inflation seem to move in opposite directions: lower
unemployment and higher inflation from 1997 to 2000, higher unemployment
and lower inflation in the early 2000s, lower unemployment and higher
inflation in the mid-2000s,</span><span id="bookmark859">‌</span></p>

<p><a href="#bookmark952" id="bookmark860" class="s34">To analyze questions like these, we must move beyond discussing macroeconomic issues one at a time, and begin building economic models that will capture the relationships and interconnections between them. The next three chapters take up this task. This chapter introduces the macroeconomic model of aggregate supply and aggregate demand, how the two interact to reach a macroeconomic equilibrium, and how shifts in aggregate demand or aggregate supply will affect that equilibrium. This chapter also relates the model of aggregate supply and aggregate demand to the three goals of economic policy (growth, unemployment, and inflation), and provides a framework for thinking about many of the connections and tradeoffs between these goals.

</ul>
<p>Macroeconomists over the last two centuries have often divided into
two groups: those who argue that supply is the most important
determinant of the size of the macroeconomy while demand just tags
along, and those who argue that demand is the most important factor
in the size of the macroeconomy while supply just tags along.</p>
<p>Say’s Law and the Macroeconomics of Supply</p>
<p><span id="bookmark862">Those economists who emphasize the role of
supply in the macroeconomy often refer to the work of a famous early
nineteenth century French economist named Jean-Baptiste Say
(1767–1832).</span> <strong>Say’s law</strong> is: “Supply creates its own
demand.” As a matter of historical accuracy, it seems clear that Say
never actually wrote down this law and that it oversimplifies his
beliefs, but the law lives on as useful shorthand for summarizing a
point of view.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark863">The intuition behind Say’s law is that each
time a good or service is produced and sold, it generates income
that is earned for someone: a worker, a manager, an owner, or those
who are workers, managers, and owners at firms that supply inputs
along the chain of production. We alluded to this earlier in our
discussion of the National Income approach to measuring GDP. The
forces of supply and demand in individual markets will cause prices
to rise and fall. The bottom line remains, however, that every sale
represents income to someone, and so, Say’s law argues, a given
value of supply must create an equivalent value of demand somewhere
else in the economy. Because Jean-Baptiste Say, Adam Smith, and
other economists writing around the turn of the nineteenth century
who discussed this view were known as “classical” economists, modern
economists who generally subscribe to the Say’s law view on the
importance of supply for determining the size of the macroeconomy
are called</span> <strong>neoclassical economists</strong>.<span
id="bookmark864">‌</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark865">If supply always creates exactly enough
demand at the macroeconomic level, then (as Say himself recognized)
it is hard to understand why periods of recession and high
unemployment should ever occur. To be sure, even if total supply
always creates an equal amount of total demand, the economy could
still experience a situation of some firms earning profits while
other firms suffer losses. Nevertheless, a recession is not a
situation where all business failures are exactly counterbalanced by
an offsetting number of successes. A recession is a situation in
which the economy as a whole is shrinking in size, business failures
outnumber the remaining success stories, and many firms end up
suffering losses and laying off workers.</span><span
id="bookmark866">‌</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark867">Say’s law that supply creates its own demand
does seem a good approximation for the long run. Over periods of
some years or decades, as the productive power of an economy to
supply goods and services increases, total demand in the economy
grows at roughly the same pace. However, over shorter time horizons
of a few months or even years, recessions or even depressions occur
in which firms, as a group, seem to face a lack of demand for their
products.</span></p>
<p>Keynes’ Law and the Macroeconomics of Demand</p>
<p><span id="bookmark868">The alternative to Say’s law, with its
emphasis on supply, is</span> <strong>Keynes’ law</strong>: “Demand creates its
own supply.” As a</p>
<p><span id="bookmark869">matter of historical accuracy, just as
Jean-Baptiste Say never wrote down anything as simpleminded as Say’s
law, John Maynard Keynes never wrote down Keynes’ law, but the law
is a useful simplification that conveys a certain point of
view.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark870">When Keynes wrote his influential work</span>
<em>The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money</em> during the
1930s Great Depression, he pointed out that during the Depression,
the economy’s capacity to supply goods and services had not changed
much. U.S. unemployment rates soared higher than 20% from 1933 to
1935, but the number of possible workers had not increased or
decreased much. Factories closed, but machinery and equipment had
not disappeared. Technologies that had been invented in the 1920s
were not un-invented and forgotten in the 1930s. Thus, Keynes argued
that the Great Depression—and many ordinary recessions as well—were
not caused by a drop in the ability of the economy to supply goods
as measured by labor, physical capital, or technology. He argued the
economy often produced less than its full potential, not because it
was technically impossible to produce more with the existing workers
and machines, but because a lack of demand in the economy as a whole
led to inadequate incentives for firms to produce. In such cases, he
argued, the level of GDP in the economy was not primarily determined
by the potential of what the economy could supply, but rather by the
amount of total demand.</p>
<p>Keynes’ law seems to apply fairly well in the short run of a few
months to a few years, when many firms experience either a drop in
demand for their output during a recession or so much demand that
they have trouble producing enough during an economic boom. However,
demand cannot tell the whole macroeconomic story, either. After all,
if demand was all that mattered at the macroeconomic level, then the
government could make the economy as large as it wanted just by
pumping up total demand through a large increase in the government
spending component or by legislating large tax cuts to push up the
consumption component. Economies do, however, face genuine limits to
how much they can produce, limits determined by the quantity of
labor, physical capital, technology, and the institutional and
market structures that bring these factors of production together.
These constraints on what an economy can supply at the macroeconomic
level do not disappear just because of an increase in demand.</p>
<p>Combining Supply and Demand in Macroeconomics</p>
<p>Two insights emerge from this overview of Say’s law with its
emphasis on macroeconomic supply and Keynes’ law with its emphasis
on macroeconomic demand. The first conclusion, which is not exactly
a hot news flash, is that an economic approach focused only on the
supply side or only on the demand side can be only a partial
success. We need to take into account both supply and demand. The
second conclusion is that since Keynes’ law applies more accurately
in the short run and Say’s law applies more accurately in the long
run, the tradeoffs and connections between the three goals of
macroeconomics may be different in the short run and the long run.</p>

</ul>
<p><span id="bookmark872">To build a useful macroeconomic model, we
need a model that shows what determines total supply or total demand
for the economy, and how total demand and total supply interact at
the macroeconomic level. We call this the</span> <strong>aggregate
demand/aggregate supply model</strong>. This module will explain aggregate
supply, aggregate demand, and the equilibrium between them. The
following modules will discuss the causes of shifts in aggregate
supply and aggregate demand.</p>
<p>The Aggregate Supply Curve and Potential GDP</p>
<p><span id="bookmark873">Firms make decisions about what quantity to
supply based on the profits they expect to earn. They determine
profits, in turn, by the price of the outputs they sell and by the
prices of the inputs, like labor or raw materials, that they need to
buy.</span> <strong>Aggregate supply (AS)</strong> refers to the total quantity
of output (i.e. real GDP) firms will produce and sell. The</p>
<p><span id="bookmark874">aggregate supply (AS) curve</span> <span
class="p">shows the total quantity of output (i.e. real GDP) that
firms will produce and sell at each price level.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark875" class="a">Figure 11.3</a> <span
class="p">shows an aggregate supply curve. In the following
paragraphs, we will walk through the elements of the diagram one at
a time: the horizontal and vertical axes, the aggregate supply curve
itself, and the meaning of the potential GDP vertical line.</span></p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_244.jpg" width="326" height="256" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark875">Figure 11.3 The Aggregate Supply Curve</span>
<span class="s37">Aggregate supply (AS) slopes up, because as the
price level for outputs rises, with the price of inputs remaining
fixed, firms have an incentive to produce more to earn higher
profits. The potential GDP line shows the maximum that the economy
can produce with full employment of workers and physical
capital.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark432" class="s34">The diagram’s horizontal axis shows real GDP—that is, the level of GDP adjusted for inflation. The vertical axis shows the price level, which measures the average price of all goods and services produced in the economy. In other words, the price level in the AD-AS model is what we called the GDP Deflator in</a>
<a href="#bookmark432" class="a">The Macroeconomic</a>
Perspective<span class="p">. Remember that the price level is
different from the inflation rate. Visualize the price level as an
index number, like the Consumer Price Index, while the inflation
rate is the percentage change in the price level over time.</span></p>
<p>As the price level rises, real GDP rises as well. Why? The price
level on the vertical axis represents prices for final goods or
outputs bought in the economy—i.e. the GDP deflator—not the price
level for intermediate goods and services that are inputs to
production. Thus, the AS curve describes how suppliers will react to
a higher price level for final outputs of goods and services, while
holding the prices of inputs like labor and energy constant. If
firms across the economy face a situation where the price level of
what they produce and sell is rising, but their costs of production
are not rising, then the lure of higher profits will induce them to
expand production. In other words, an aggregate supply curve shows
how producers as a group will respond to an increase in aggregate
demand.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark876">An AS curve’s slope changes from nearly flat
at its far left to nearly vertical at its far right. At the far left
of the aggregate supply curve, the level of output in the economy is
far below</span> <strong>potential GDP</strong>, which we define as the amount of
real GDP an economy can produce by fully employing its existing
levels of labor, physical capital, and technology, in the context of
its existing market and legal institutions. At these relatively low
levels of output, levels of unemployment are high, and many
factories are running only part-time, or have closed their doors. In
this situation, a relatively small increase in the prices of the
outputs that businesses sell—while assuming no rise in input
prices—can encourage a considerable surge in the quantity of
aggregate supply because so many workers and factories are ready to
swing into production.</p>
<p>As the GDP increases, however, some firms and industries will start
running into limits: perhaps nearly all of the expert workers in a
certain industry will have jobs or factories in certain geographic
areas or industries will be running at full speed. In the AS curve’s
intermediate area, a higher price level for outputs continues to
encourage a greater quantity of output—but as the increasingly steep
upward slope of the aggregate supply curve shows, the increase in
real GDP in response to a given rise in the price level will not be
as large. (Read the following Clear It Up feature to learn why the
AS curve crosses potential GDP.)</p>
<p>Why does AS cross potential GDP?</p>
<p>Economists typically draw the aggregate supply curve to cross the
potential GDP line. This shape may seem puzzling: How can an economy
produce at an output level which is higher than its “potential” or
“full employment” GDP? The economic intuition here is that if prices
for outputs were high enough, producers would make fanatical efforts
to produce: all workers would be on double-overtime, all machines
would run 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Such hyper-intense
production would go beyond using potential labor and physical
capital resources fully, to using them in a way that is not
sustainable in the long term. Thus, it is possible for production to
sprint above potential GDP, but only in the short run.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_245.png" width="624" height="51" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark877">At the far right, the aggregate supply curve
becomes nearly vertical. At this quantity, higher prices for outputs
cannot encourage additional output, because even if firms want to
expand output, the inputs of labor and machinery in the economy are
fully employed. In this example, the vertical line in the exhibit
shows that potential GDP occurs at a total output of 9,500. When an
economy is operating at its potential GDP, machines and factories
are running at capacity, and the unemployment rate is relatively
low—at the natural rate of unemployment. For this reason, potential
GDP is sometimes also called</span> <strong>full-employment GDP</strong>.</p>
<p>The Aggregate Demand Curve</p>
<p><span id="bookmark878">Aggregate demand (AD)</span>
<a href="#bookmark1788" class="s34">refers to the amount of total spending on domestic goods and services in an economy. (Strictly speaking, AD is what economists call total planned expenditure. We will further explain this distinction in the appendix</a>
<a href="#bookmark1788" class="a">The Expenditure-Output Model</a><span
class="s54"> </span><span class="p">. For now, just think of
aggregate demand as total spending.) It includes all four components
of demand: consumption, investment, government spending, and net
exports (exports minus imports). This demand is determined by a
number of factors, but one of them is the price level—recall though,
that the price level is an index number such as the GDP deflator
that measures the average price of the things we buy. The
</span>aggregate demand (AD) curve <span class="p">shows the total
spending on domestic goods and services at each price
level.</span><span id="bookmark879">‌</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark880" class="a">Figure 11.4</a> <span
class="p">presents an aggregate demand (AD) curve. Just like the
aggregate supply curve, the horizontal axis shows real GDP and the
vertical axis shows the price level. The AD curve slopes down, which
means that increases in the price level of outputs lead to a lower
quantity of total spending. The reasons behind this shape are
related to how changes in the price level affect the different
components of aggregate demand. The following components comprise
aggregate demand: consumption spending (C), investment spending (I),
government spending (G), and spending on exports (X) minus imports
(M): C + I + G + X – M.</span></p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_246.jpg" width="326" height="256" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark880">Figure 11.4 The Aggregate Demand Curve</span>
<span class="s37">Aggregate demand (AD) slopes down, showing that,
as the price level rises, the amount of total spending on domestic
goods and services declines.</span></p>
<p>The wealth effect holds that as the price level increases, the
buying power of savings that people have stored up in bank accounts
and other assets will diminish, eaten away to some extent by
inflation. Because a rise in the price level reduces people’s
wealth, consumption spending will fall as the price level rises.</p>
<p>The interest rate effect is that as prices for outputs rise, the
same purchases will take more money or credit to accomplish. This
additional demand for money and credit will push interest rates
higher. In turn, higher interest rates will reduce borrowing by
businesses for investment purposes and reduce borrowing by
households for homes and cars—thus reducing consumption and
investment spending.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark881">The foreign price effect points out that if
prices rise in the United States while remaining fixed in other
countries, then goods in the United States will be relatively more
expensive compared to goods in the rest of the world. U.S. exports
will be relatively more expensive, and the quantity of exports sold
will fall. U.S. imports from abroad will be relatively cheaper, so
the quantity of imports will rise. Thus, a higher domestic price
level, relative to price levels in other countries, will reduce net
export expenditures.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark880" class="s34">Among economists all three of these effects are controversial, in part because they do not seem to be very large. For this reason, the aggregate demand curve in</a>
<a href="#bookmark880" class="a">Figure 11.4</a> <span
class="p">slopes downward fairly steeply. The steep slope indicates
that a higher price level for final outputs reduces aggregate demand
for all three of these reasons, but that the change in the quantity
of aggregate demand as a result of changes in price level is not
very large.</span></p>

<p>Figure 11.5 The AD/AS Curves
<a href="#bookmark882" class="s84">AD and AS curves created from the data in</a>
<a href="#bookmark882" class="s43">Table</a> <span

<p>Step 5. Determine where AD and AS intersect. This is the equilibrium
with price level at 130 and real GDP at</p>
<p>$680.</p>
<p>Step 6. Look at the graph to determine where equilibrium is located.
We can see that this equilibrium is fairly far from where the AS
curve becomes near-vertical (or at least quite steep) which seems to
start at about</p>
<p>$750 of real output. This implies that the economy is not close to
potential GDP. Thus, unemployment will be high. In the relatively
flat part of the AS curve, where the equilibrium occurs, changes in
the price level will not be a major concern, since such changes are
likely to be small.</p>
<p>Step 7. Determine what the steep portion of the AS curve indicates.
Where the AS curve is steep, the economy is at or close to potential
GDP.</p>
<p>Step 8. Draw conclusions from the given information:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If equilibrium occurs in the flat range of AS, then economy is
not close to potential GDP and will be experiencing
unemployment, but stable price level.</p></li>
<li><p>If equilibrium occurs in the steep range of AS, then the economy
is close or at potential GDP and will be experiencing rising
price levels or inflationary pressures, but will have a low
unemployment rate.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span id="bookmark884">Equilibrium in the Aggregate Demand/Aggregate
Supply Model</span></p>
<p>The intersection of the aggregate supply and aggregate demand curves
shows the equilibrium level of real GDP and the equilibrium price
level in the economy. At a relatively low price level for output,
firms have little incentive to produce, although consumers would be
willing to purchase a large quantity of output. As the price level
rises, aggregate supply rises and aggregate demand falls until the
equilibrium point is reached.</p>

<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_250.png" width="624" height="503" alt="image" />
<p>Confusion sometimes arises between the aggregate supply and
aggregate demand model and the microeconomic analysis of demand and
supply in particular markets for goods, services, labor, and
capital. Read the following Clear It Up feature to gain an
understanding of whether AS and AD are macro or micro.</p>
<p>Are AS and AD macro or micro?</p>
<p>These aggregate supply and demand models and the microeconomic
analysis of demand and supply in particular markets for goods,
services, labor, and capital have a superficial resemblance, but
they also have many underlying differences.</p>
<p>For example, the vertical and horizontal axes have distinctly
different meanings in macroeconomic and microeconomic diagrams. The
vertical axis of a microeconomic demand and supply diagram expresses
a price (or wage or rate of return) for an individual good or
service. This price is implicitly relative: it is intended to be
compared with the prices of other products (for example, the price
of pizza relative to the price of fried chicken). In contrast, the
vertical axis of an aggregate supply and aggregate demand diagram
expresses the level of a price index like the Consumer Price Index
or the GDP deflator—combining a wide array of prices from across the
economy. The price level is absolute: it is not intended to be
compared to any other prices since it is essentially the average
price of all products in an economy. The horizontal axis of a
microeconomic supply and demand curve measures the quantity of a
particular good or service. In contrast, the horizontal axis of the
aggregate demand and aggregate supply diagram measures GDP, which is
the sum of all the final goods and services produced in the economy,
not the quantity in a specific market.</p>
<p>In addition, the economic reasons for the shapes of the curves in
the macroeconomic model are different from the reasons behind the
shapes of the curves in microeconomic models. Demand curves for
individual goods or services slope down primarily because of the
existence of substitute goods, not the wealth effects, interest
rate, and foreign price effects associated with aggregate demand
curves. The slopes of individual supply and demand curves can have a
variety of different slopes, depending on the extent to which
quantity demanded and quantity supplied react to price in that
specific market, but the slopes of the AS and AD curves are much the
same in every diagram (although as we shall see in later chapters,
short-run and long-run perspectives will emphasize different parts
of the AS curve).</p>
<p>In short, just because the AD/AS diagram has two lines that cross,
do not assume that it is the same as every other diagram where two
lines cross. The intuitions and meanings of the macro and micro
diagrams are only</p>
<p>distant cousins from different branches of the economics family
tree.</p>
<p>Defining SRAS and LRAS</p>
<p><span id="bookmark886">In the Clear It Up feature titled “Why does
AS cross potential GDP?” we differentiated between short run changes
in aggregate supply which the AS curve shows and long run changes in
aggregate supply which the vertical line at potential GDP defines.
In the short run, if demand is too low (or too high), it is possible
for producers to supply less GDP (or more GDP) than potential. In
the long run, however, producers are limited to producing at
potential GDP. For this reason, we may also refer to what we have
been calling the AS curve as the</span> <strong>short run aggregate supply
(SRAS) curve</strong>. We may also refer to the vertical line at potential
GDP as the <strong>long run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve</strong>.<span

<p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Explain how productivity growth changes the aggregate supply
curve</p></li>
<li><p>Explain how changes in input prices change the aggregate supply
curve</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The original equilibrium in the AD/AS diagram will shift to a new
equilibrium if the AS or AD curve shifts. When the aggregate supply
curve shifts to the right, then at every price level, producers
supply a greater quantity of real GDP. When the AS curve shifts to
the left, then at every price level, producers supply a lower
quantity of real GDP. This module discusses two of the most
important factors that can lead to shifts in the AS curve:
productivity growth and changes in input prices.</p>
<p>How Productivity Growth Shifts the AS Curve</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark891" id="bookmark889" class="s34">In the long run, the most important factor shifting the AS curve is productivity growth. Productivity means how much output can be produced with a given quantity of labor. One measure of this is output per worker or GDP per capita. Over time, productivity grows so that the same quantity of labor can produce more output. Historically, the real growth in GDP per capita in an advanced economy like the United States has averaged about 2% to 3% per year, but productivity growth has been faster during certain extended periods like the 1960s and the late 1990s through the early 2000s, or slower during periods like the 1970s. A higher level of productivity shifts the AS curve to the right, because with improved productivity, firms can produce a greater quantity of output at every price level.</a>
<a href="#bookmark891" class="a">Figure</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark891">11.7</a><span id="bookmark890">‌</span></p>
<p>(a) shows an outward shift in productivity over two time periods.
The AS curve shifts out from SRAS<span class="s60">0</span> to
SRAS<span class="s60">1</span> to SRAS<span class="s60">2</span>,
and the equilibrium shifts from E<span class="s60">0</span> to
E<span class="s60">1</span> to E<span class="s60">2</span>. Note
that with increased productivity, workers can produce more GDP.
Thus, full employment corresponds to a higher level of potential
GDP, which we show as a rightward shift in LRAS from LRAS<span
class="s60">0</span> to LRAS<span class="s60">1</span> to LRAS<span
class="s60">2</span>.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_251.jpg" width="621" height="333" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark891"><span class="s36">Figure 11.7 Shifts in
Aggregate Supply </span></span>(a) The rise in productivity causes
the SRAS curve to shift to the right. The original equilibrium
E<span class="s63">0</span> is at the intersection of AD and
SRAS<span class="s63">0</span>. When SRAS shifts right, then the new
equilibrium E<span class="s63">1</span> is at the intersection of AD
and SRAS<span class="s63">1</span>, and then yet another
equilibrium, E<span class="s63">2</span>, is at the intersection of
AD and SRAS<span class="s63">2</span>.</p>
<p>Shifts in SRAS to the right, lead to a greater level of output and
to downward pressure on the price level. (b) A higher price for
inputs means that at any given price level for outputs, a lower real
GDP will be produced so aggregate supply will shift to the left from
SRAS<span class="s63">0</span> to SRAS<span class="s63">1</span>.
The new equilibrium, E<span class="s63">1</span>, has a reduced
quantity of output and a higher price level than the original
equilibrium (E<span class="s63">0</span>).</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark96" class="s34">A shift in the SRAS curve to the right will result in a greater real GDP and downward pressure on the price level, if aggregate demand remains unchanged. However, if this shift in SRAS results from gains in productivity growth, which we typically measure in terms of a few percentage points per year, the effect will be relatively small over a few months or even a couple of years. Recall how in</a>
<a href="#bookmark96" class="a">Choice in a World of</a>
Scarcity<span class="p">, we said that a nation’s production
possibilities frontier is fixed in the short run, but shifts out in
the long run? This is the same phenomenon using a different
model.</span></p>
<p>How Changes in Input Prices Shift the AS Curve</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark891" class="s34">Higher prices for inputs that are widely used across the entire economy can have a macroeconomic impact on aggregate supply. Examples of such widely used inputs include labor and energy products. Increases in the price of such inputs will cause the SRAS curve to shift to the left, which means that at each given price level for outputs, a higher price for inputs will discourage production because it will reduce the possibilities for earning profits.</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark891">Figure</a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark891" id="bookmark892" class="a">11.7</a><span
class="s54"> </span>(b) shows the aggregate supply curve shifting to
the left, from SRAS<span class="s60">0</span> to SRAS<span
class="s60">1</span>, causing the equilibrium to move from E<span
class="s60">0</span> to E<span class="s60">1</span>. The movement
from the original equilibrium of E<span class="s60">0</span> to the
new equilibrium of E<span class="s60">1</span> will bring a nasty
set of effects: reduced GDP or recession, higher unemployment
because the economy is now further away from potential GDP, and an
inflationary higher price level as well. For example, the U.S.
economy experienced recessions in 1974–1975, 1980–1982, 1990–91,
2001, and 2007–2009 that were each preceded or accompanied by a rise
in the key input of oil prices. In the 1970s, this pattern of a
shift to the left in SRAS leading to a stagnant economy with high
unemployment and inflation was nicknamed <strong>stagflation</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark891" class="s34">Conversely, a decline in the price of a key input like oil will shift the SRAS curve to the right, providing an incentive for more to be produced at every given price level for outputs. From 1985 to 1986, for example, the average price of crude oil fell by almost half, from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(24 a barrel to \)</span>12 a barrel. Similarly, from 1997 to 1998, the price of a barrel of crude oil dropped from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(17 per barrel to \)</span>11 per barrel. In both cases, the plummeting oil price led to a situation like that which we presented earlier in</a>
<a href="#bookmark891" class="a">Figure 11.7</a> <span
class="p">(a), where the outward shift of SRAS to the right allowed
the economy to expand, unemployment to fall, and inflation to
decline.</span></p>
<p>Along with energy prices, two other key inputs that may shift the
SRAS curve are the cost of labor, or wages, and the cost of imported
goods that we use as inputs for other products. In these cases as
well, the lesson is that lower prices for inputs cause SRAS to shift
to the right, while higher prices cause it to shift back to the
left. Note that, unlike changes in productivity, changes in input
prices do not generally cause LRAS to shift, only SRAS.</p>
<p>Other Supply Shocks</p>
<p>The aggregate supply curve can also shift due to shocks to input
goods or labor. For example, an unexpected early freeze could
destroy a large number of agricultural crops, a shock that would
shift the AS curve to the left since there would be fewer
agricultural products available at any given price.</p>
<p>Similarly, shocks to the labor market can affect aggregate supply.
An extreme example might be an overseas war that required a large
number of workers to cease their ordinary production in order to go
fight for their country. In this case, SRAS and LRAS would both
shift to the left because there would be fewer workers available to
produce goods at any given price.</p>

<p>Do imports diminish aggregate demand?</p>
<p>We have seen that the formula for aggregate demand is AD = C +
I + G + X - M, where M is the total value of imported goods. Why
is there a minus sign in front of imports? Does this mean that
more imports will result in a lower level of aggregate demand?
The short answer is yes, because aggregate demand is defined as
total demand for domestically produced goods and services.</p>
<p>When an American buys a foreign product, for example, it gets
counted along with all the other consumption. Thus, the income
generated does not go to American producers, but rather to
producers in another country. It would be wrong to count this as
part of domestic demand. Therefore, imports added in consumption
are subtracted back out in the M term of the equation.</p>
<p>Because of the way in which we write the demand equation, it is
easy to make the mistake of thinking that imports are bad for
the economy. Just keep in mind that every negative number in the
M term has a corresponding positive number in the C or I or G
term, and they always cancel out.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark952" class="s34">As we mentioned previously, the components of aggregate demand are consumption spending (C), investment spending (I), government spending (G), and spending on exports (X) minus imports (M). (Read the following Clear It Up feature for explanation of why imports are subtracted from exports and what this means for aggregate demand.) A shift of the AD curve to the right means that at least one of these components increased so that a greater amount of total spending would occur at every price level. A shift of the AD curve to the left means that at least one of these components decreased so that a lesser amount of total spending would occur at every price level.</a>
<a href="#bookmark952" class="a">The Keynesian Perspective</a>
<span class="p">will discuss the components of aggregate demand
and the factors that affect them. Here, the discussion will
sketch two broad categories that could cause AD curves to shift:
changes in consumer or firm behavior and changes in government
tax or spending policy.</span></p>
<p>How Changes by Consumers and Firms Can Affect AD</p>
<p><span id="bookmark894">When consumers feel more confident about
the future of the economy, they tend to consume more. If
business confidence is high, then firms tend to spend more on
investment, believing that the future payoff from that
investment will be substantial. Conversely, if consumer or
business confidence drops, then consumption and investment
spending decline.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/" id="bookmark895" class="s34">The University of Michigan publishes a survey of consumer confidence and constructs an index of consumer confidence each month. The survey results are then reported at</a>
<a href="http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/" class="a">http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu (http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/)</a>
<span class="p">, which break down the change in consumer
confidence among different income levels. According to that
index, consumer confidence averaged around 90 prior to the Great
Recession, and then it fell to below 60 in late 2008, which was
the lowest it had been since 1980. Since then, confidence has
climbed from a 2011 low of 55.8 back to a level in the low 80s,
which economists consider close to a healthy state.</span></p>
<p>The Organization for Economic Development and Cooperation (OECD)
publishes one measure of business confidence: the “business
tendency surveys”. The OECD collects business opinion survey
data for 21 countries on future selling prices and employment,
among other business climate elements. After sharply declining
during the Great Recession, the measure has risen above zero
again and is back to long-term averages (the indicator dips
below zero when business outlook is weaker than usual). Of
course, either of these survey measures is not very precise.
They can however, suggest when confidence is rising or falling,
as well as when it is relatively high or low compared to the
past.</p>
<p>Because economists associate a rise in confidence with higher
consumption and investment demand, it will lead to an outward
shift in the AD curve, and a move of the equilibrium, from
E<span class="s60">0</span> to E<span
class="s60">1</span><a href="#bookmark896" class="s34">, to a higher quantity of output and a higher price level, as</a>

confidence.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark896" class="s34">Consumer and business confidence often reflect macroeconomic realities; for example, confidence is usually high when the economy is growing briskly and low during a recession. However, economic confidence can sometimes rise or fall for reasons that do not have a close connection to the immediate economy, like a risk of war, election results, foreign policy events, or a pessimistic prediction about the future by a prominent public figure. U.S. presidents, for example, must be careful in their public pronouncements about the economy. If they offer economic pessimism, they risk provoking a decline in confidence that reduces consumption and investment and shifts AD to the left, and in a self-fulfilling prophecy, contributes to causing the recession that the president warned against in the first place.</a>

the original equilibrium (E<span class="s63">0</span>). In this
example, the new equilibrium (E<span class="s63">1</span>) is
also closer to potential GDP. An increase in government spending

also shift AD to the right. (b) A decrease in consumer

AD<span class="s63">0</span> to AD<span class="s63">1</span>.
When AD shifts to the left, the new equilibrium (E<span

also a lower price level compared with the original equilibrium

equilibrium (E<span class="s63">1</span>) is also farther below
potential GDP. A decrease in government spending or higher taxes
that leads to a fall in consumer spending can also shift AD to
the left.</p>
<p>How Government Macroeconomic Policy Choices Can Shift AD</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark896" class="s34">Government spending is one component of AD. Thus, higher government spending will cause AD to shift to the right, as in</a>
<a href="#bookmark896" class="a">Figure 11.8</a>
<a href="#bookmark896" class="s34">(a), while lower government spending will cause AD to shift to the left, as in</a>
<a href="#bookmark896" class="a">Figure 11.8</a> <span
class="p">(b). For example, in the United States, government
spending declined by 3.2% of GDP during the 1990s, from 21% of
GDP in 1991, and to 17.8% of GDP in 1998. However, from 2005 to
2009, the peak of the Great Recession, government spending
increased from 19% of GDP to 21.4% of GDP. If changes of a few
percentage points of GDP seem small to you, remember that since
GDP was about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(14.4 trillion in 2009, a seemingly small change
of 2% of GDP is equal to close to \)</span>300 billion.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark897">Tax policy can affect consumption and
investment spending, too. Tax cuts for individuals will tend to
increase consumption demand, while tax increases will tend to
diminish it. Tax policy can also pump up investment demand by
offering lower tax rates for corporations or tax reductions that
benefit specific kinds of investment. Shifting C or I will shift
the AD curve as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark898">During a recession, when unemployment is
high and many businesses are suffering low profits or even
losses, the</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark899" class="s34">U.S. Congress often passes tax cuts. During the 2001 recession, for example, the U.S. Congress enacted a tax cut into law. At such times, the political rhetoric often focuses on how people experiencing hard times need relief from taxes. The aggregate supply and aggregate demand framework, however, offers a complementary rationale, as</a>
<a href="#bookmark899" class="a">Figure</a> <span
class="s54">11.9 </span>illustrates. The original equilibrium
during a recession is at point E<span class="s60">0</span>,
relatively far from the full employment level of output. The tax
cut, by increasing consumption, shifts the AD curve to the
right. At the new equilibrium (E<span class="s60">1</span>),
real GDP rises and unemployment falls and, because in this
diagram the economy has not yet reached its potential or full
employment level of GDP, any rise in the price level remains
muted. Read the following Clear It Up feature to consider the
question of whether economists favor tax cuts or oppose them.</p>

<p>Do economists favor tax cuts or oppose them?</p>
<p>One of the most fundamental divisions in American politics over
the last few decades has been between those who believe that the
government should cut taxes substantially and those who
disagree. Ronald Reagan rode into the presidency in 1980 partly
because of his promise, soon carried out, to enact a substantial
tax cut. George Bush lost his bid for reelection against Bill
Clinton in 1992 partly because he had broken his 1988 promise:
“Read my lips! No new taxes!” In the 2000 presidential election,
both George W. Bush and Al Gore advocated substantial tax cuts
and Bush succeeded in pushing a tax cut package through Congress
early in 2001. More recently in 2017, Donald Trump has pushed
for tax cuts to stimulate the economy. Disputes over tax cuts
often ignite at the state and local level as well.</p>
<p>What side do economists take? Do they support broad tax cuts or
oppose them? The answer, unsatisfying to zealots on both sides,
is that it depends. One issue is whether equally large
government spending cuts accompany the tax cuts. Economists
differ, as does any broad cross-section of the public, on how
large government spending should be and what programs the
government might cut back. A second issue, more</p>
<p><span id="bookmark899"><span class="s36">Figure 11.9 Recession
and Full Employment in the AD/AS Model </span></span>Whether the
economy is in a recession is illustrated in the AD/AS model by
how close the equilibrium is to the potential GDP line as
indicated by the vertical LRAS line. In this example, the level
of output Y<span class="s63">0</span> at the equilibrium E<span
class="s63">0</span> is relatively far from the potential GDP
line, so it can represent an economy in recession, well below
the full employment level of GDP. In contrast, the level of
output Y<span class="s63">1</span> at the equilibrium E<span
class="s63">1</span> is relatively close to potential GDP, and
so it would represent an economy with a lower unemployment rate.</p>
<p>relevant to the discussion in this chapter, concerns how close
the economy is to the full employment output level. In a
recession, when the AD and AS curves intersect far below the
full employment level, tax cuts can make sense as a way of
shifting AD to the right. However, when the economy is already
performing extremely well, tax cuts may shift AD so far to the
right as to generate inflationary pressures, with little gain to
GDP.</p>
<p>With the AD/AS framework in mind, many economists might readily
believe that the 1981 Reagan tax cuts, which took effect just
after two serious recessions, were beneficial economic policy.
Similarly, Congress enacted the 2001 Bush tax cuts and the 2009
Obama tax cuts during recessions. However, some of the same
economists who favor tax cuts during recession would be much
more dubious about identical tax cuts at a time the economy is
performing well and cyclical unemployment is low.</p>

<a href="#bookmark1483" class="a">The Impacts of Government</a>

<a href="#bookmark1177" class="a">Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation</a>
<span class="p">chapter, the Federal Reserve can affect interest
rates and credit availability. Higher interest rates tend to
discourage borrowing and thus reduce both household spending on
big- ticket items like houses and cars and investment spending
by business. Conversely, lower interest rates will stimulate
consumption and investment demand. Interest rates can also
affect exchange rates, which in turn will have effects on the
export and import components of aggregate demand.</span></p>

the aggregate demand curve to the right leads to a greater real
GDP and to upward pressure on the price level. Conversely, a
shift of aggregate demand to the left leads to a lower real GDP
and a lower price level. Whether these changes in output and
price level are relatively large or relatively small, and how
the change in equilibrium relates to potential GDP, depends on
whether the shift in the AD curve is happening in the AS curve’s
relatively flat or relatively steep portion.</span></p>

<p><span id="bookmark901">The AD/AS model can convey a number
of interlocking relationships between the three
macroeconomic goals of growth, unemployment, and low
inflation. Moreover, the AD/AS framework is flexible enough
to accommodate both the Keynes’ law approach that focuses on
aggregate demand and the short run, while also including the
Say’s law approach that focuses on aggregate supply and the
long run. These advantages are considerable. Every model is
a simplified version of the deeper reality and, in the
context of the AD/AS model, the three macroeconomic goals
arise in ways that are sometimes indirect or incomplete. In
this module, we consider how the AD/AS model illustrates the
three macroeconomic goals of economic growth, low
unemployment, and low inflation.</span></p>
<p>Growth and Recession in the AD/AS Diagram</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark891" class="s34">In the AD/AS diagram, long-run economic growth due to productivity increases over time will be represented by a gradual shift to the right of aggregate supply. The vertical line representing potential GDP (or the “full employment level of GDP”) will gradually shift to the right over time as well. Earlier</a>
<a href="#bookmark891" class="a">Figure 11.7</a> <span
class="p">(a) showed a pattern of economic growth over three
years, with the AS curve shifting slightly out to the right
each year. However, the factors that determine the speed of
this long-term economic growth rate—like investment in
physical and human capital, technology, and whether an
economy can take advantage of catch-up growth—do not appear
directly in the AD/AS diagram.</span></p>
<p>In the short run, GDP falls and rises in every economy, as
the economy dips into recession or expands out of recession.</p>
<p>The AD/AS diagram illustrates recessions when the
equilibrium level of real GDP is substantially below
potential GDP, as we see at the equilibrium point E<span
class="s60">0</span>
<a href="#bookmark899" class="s34">in</a>
<a href="#bookmark899" class="a">Figure</a> <span
class="s54">11.9</span>. From another standpoint, in years
of resurgent economic growth the equilibrium will typically
be close to potential GDP, as equilibrium point E<span
class="s60">1</span> in that earlier figure shows.</p>
<p>Unemployment in the AD/AS Diagram</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark619" id="bookmark902" class="s34">We described two types of unemployment in the</a>
<a href="#bookmark619" class="a">Unemployment</a> <span
class="p">chapter. Short run variations in unemployment
(cyclical unemployment) are caused by the business cycle as
the economy expands and contracts. Over the long run, in the
United States, the unemployment rate typically hovers around
5% (give or take one percentage point or so), when the
economy is healthy. In many of the national economies across
Europe, the unemployment rate in recent decades has only
dropped to about 10% or a bit lower, even in good economic
years. We call this baseline level of unemployment that
occurs year-in and year-out the natural rate of unemployment
and we determine it by how well the structures of market and
government institutions in the economy lead to a matching of
workers and employers in the labor market. Potential GDP can
imply different unemployment rates in different economies,
depending on the natural rate of unemployment for that
economy.</span><span id="bookmark903">‌</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark899" class="s34">The AD/AS diagram shows cyclical unemployment by how close the economy is to the potential or full GDP employment level. Returning to</a>
<a href="#bookmark899" class="a">Figure</a> <span
class="s54">11.9</span>, relatively low cyclical
unemployment for an economy occurs when the level of output
is close to potential GDP, as in the equilibrium point
E<span class="s60">1</span>. Conversely, high cyclical
unemployment arises when the output is substantially to the
left of potential GDP on the AD/AS diagram, as at the
equilibrium point E<span class="s60">0</span>. Although we
do not show the factors that determine the natural rate of
unemployment separately in the AD/AS model, they are
implicitly part of what determines potential GDP or full
employment GDP in a given economy.</p>
<p>Inflationary Pressures in the AD/AS Diagram</p>
<p>Inflation fluctuates in the short run. Higher inflation
rates have typically occurred either during or just after
economic booms: for example, the biggest spurts of inflation
in the U.S. economy during the twentieth century followed
the wartime booms of World War I and World War II.
Conversely, rates of inflation generally decline during
recessions. As an extreme example, inflation actually became
negative—a situation called “deflation”—during the Great
Depression. Even during the relatively short 1991-1992
recession, the inflation rate declined from 5.4% in 1990 to
3.0% in 1992. During the relatively short 2001 recession,
the rate of inflation declined from 3.4% in 2000 to 1.6%
in 2002. During the deep recession of 2007–2009, the
inflation rate declined from 3.8% in 2008 to –0.4% in 2009.
Some countries have experienced bouts of high inflation that
lasted for years. In the U.S. economy since the mid–1980s,
inflation does not seem to have had any long-term trend to
be substantially higher. Instead, it has stayed in the 1–5%
range annually.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark904" class="s34">The AD/AS framework implies two ways that inflationary pressures may arise. One possible trigger is if aggregate demand continues to shift to the right when the economy is already at or near potential GDP and full employment, thus pushing the macroeconomic equilibrium into the AS curve’s steep portion. In</a>
<a href="#bookmark904" class="a">Figure 11.10</a><span
class="s54"> </span>(a), there is a shift of aggregate
demand to the right. The new equilibrium E<span
class="s60">1</span> is clearly at a higher price level than
the original equilibrium E<span class="s60">0</span>. In
this situation, the aggregate demand in the economy has
soared so high that firms in the economy are not capable of
producing additional goods, because labor and physical
capital are fully employed, and so additional increases in
aggregate demand can only result in a rise in the price
level.</p>

<p><span id="bookmark904"><span class="s36">Figure 11.10
Sources of Inflationary Pressure in the AD/AS Model
</span></span>(a) A shift in aggregate demand, from AD<span
class="s63">0</span> to AD<span class="s63">1</span>, when
it happens in the area of the SRAS curve that is near
potential GDP, will lead to a higher price level and to
pressure for a higher price level and inflation. The new
equilibrium (E1) is at a higher price level (P1) than the
original equilibrium. (b) A shift in aggregate supply, from
SRAS<span class="s63">0</span> to SRAS<span
class="s63">1</span>, will lead to a lower real GDP and to
pressure for a higher price level and inflation. The new
equilibrium (E<span class="s63">1</span>) is at a higher
price level (P<span class="s63">1</span>), while the
original equilibrium (E<span class="s63">0</span>) is at the
lower price level (P<span class="s63">0</span>).</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark904" class="s34">An alternative source of inflationary pressures can occur due to a rise in input prices that affects many or most firms across the economy—perhaps an important input to production like oil or labor—and causes the aggregate supply curve to shift back to the left. In</a>
<a href="#bookmark904" class="a">Figure 11.10</a><span
class="s54"> </span>(b), the SRAS curve’s shift to the left
also increases the price level from P<span
class="s60">0</span> at the original equilibrium (E<span
class="s60">0</span>) to a higher price level of P<span
class="s60">1</span> at the new equilibrium (E<span
class="s60">1</span>). In effect, the rise in input prices
ends up, after the final output is produced and sold,
passing along in the form of a higher price level for
outputs.</p>
<p>The AD/AS diagram shows only a one-time shift in the price
level. It does not address the question of what would cause
inflation either to vanish after a year, or to sustain
itself for several years. There are two explanations for why
inflation may persist over time. One way that continual
inflationary price increases can occur is if the government
continually attempts to stimulate aggregate demand in a way
that keeps pushing the AD curve when it is already in the
SRAS curve’s steep portion. A second possibility is that, if
inflation has been occurring for several years, people might
begin to expect a certain level of inflation. If they do,
then these expectations will cause prices, wages and
interest rates to increase annually by the amount of the
inflation expected. These two reasons are interrelated,
because if a government fosters a macroeconomic environment
with inflationary pressures, then people will grow to expect
inflation. However, the AD/AS diagram does not show these
patterns of ongoing or expected inflation in a direct way.</p>
<p>Importance of the Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model</p>
<p>Macroeconomics takes an overall view of the economy, which
means that it needs to juggle many different concepts. For
example, start with the three macroeconomic goals of growth,
low inflation, and low unemployment. Aggregate demand has
four elements: consumption, investment, government spending,
and exports less imports. Aggregate supply reveals how
businesses throughout the economy will react to a higher
price level for outputs. Finally, a wide array of economic
events and policy decisions can affect aggregate demand and
aggregate supply, including government tax and spending
decisions; consumer and business confidence; changes in
prices of key inputs like oil; and technology that brings
higher levels of productivity.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark96" class="s34">The aggregate demand/aggregate supply model is one of the fundamental diagrams in this course (like the budget constraint diagram that we introduced in the</a>

class="p">identifies: the Keynesian zone, the neoclassical zone, and the
intermediate zone.</span></p>

<p><span id="bookmark907">Figure 11.11 Keynes, Neoclassical, and
Intermediate Zones in the Aggregate Supply Curve</span> <span
class="s37">Near the equilibrium Ek, in the Keynesian zone at the far
left of the SRAS curve, small shifts in AD, either to the right or the
left, will affect the output level Yk, but will not much affect the
price level. In the Keynesian zone, AD largely determines the quantity
of output. Near the equilibrium En, in the neoclassical zone at the SRAS
curve’s far right, small shifts in AD, either to the right or the left,
will have relatively little effect on the output level Yn, but instead
will have a greater effect on the price level. In the neoclassical zone,
the near-vertical SRAS curve close to the level of potential GDP largely
determines the quantity of output. In the intermediate zone around
equilibrium Ei, movement in AD to the right will increase both the
output level and the price level, while a movement in AD to the left
would decrease both the output level and the price level.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark908">Focus first on the</span> <strong>Keynesian zone</strong>,
that portion of the SRAS curve on the far left which is relatively flat.
If the AD curve crosses this portion of the SRAS curve at an equilibrium
point like Ek, then certain statements about the economic situation will
follow. In the Keynesian zone, the equilibrium level of real GDP is far
below potential GDP, the economy is in recession, and cyclical
unemployment is high. If aggregate demand shifted to the right or left
in the Keynesian zone, it will determine the resulting level of output
(and thus unemployment). However, inflationary price pressure is not
much of a worry in the Keynesian zone, since the price level does not
vary much in this zone.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark909">Now, focus your attention on the</span>
<strong>neoclassical zone</strong> of the SRAS curve, which is the near-vertical
portion on the right- hand side. If the AD curve crosses this portion of
the SRAS curve at an equilibrium point like En where output is at or
near potential GDP, then the size of potential GDP pretty much
determines the level of output in the economy.</p>
<p>Since the equilibrium is near potential GDP, cyclical unemployment is
low in this economy, although structural unemployment may remain an
issue. In the neoclassical zone, shifts of aggregate demand to the right
or the left have little effect on the level of output or employment. The
only way to increase the size of the real GDP in the neoclassical zone
is for AS to shift to the right. However, shifts in AD in the
neoclassical zone will create pressures to change the price level.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark910">Finally, consider the SRAS curve’s</span>
<strong>intermediate zone</strong> <a href="#bookmark907" class="s34">in</a>
<a href="#bookmark907" class="a">Figure</a> <span
class="s54">11.11</span>. If the AD curve crosses this portion of the
SRAS curve at an equilibrium point like Ei, then we might expect
unemployment and inflation to move in opposing directions. For instance,
a shift of AD to the right will move output closer to potential GDP and
thus reduce unemployment, but will also lead to a higher price level and
upward pressure on inflation. Conversely, a shift of AD to the left will
move output further from potential GDP and raise unemployment, but will
also lead to a lower price level and downward pressure on inflation.</p>

<p><a href="#bookmark952" class="s34">This approach of dividing the SRAS curve into different zones works as a diagnostic test that we can apply to an economy, like a doctor checking a patient for symptoms. First, figure out in what zone the economy is. This will clarify the economic issues, tradeoffs, and policy choices. Some economists believe that the economy is strongly predisposed to be in one zone or another. Thus, hard-line Keynesian economists believe that the economies are in the Keynesian zone most of the time, and so they view the neoclassical zone as a theoretical abstraction. Conversely, hard-line neoclassical economists argue that economies are in the neoclassical zone most of the time and that the Keynesian zone is a distraction.</a>

<p>From Housing Bubble to Housing Bust</p>
<p>We can explain economic fluctuations, whether those experienced during
the 1930s Great Depression, the 1970s stagflation, or the 2008-2009
Great Recession, can be explained using the AD/AS diagram. Short- run
fluctuations in output occur due to shifts of the SRAS curve, the AD
curve, or both. In the case of the housing bubble, rising home values
caused the AD curve to shift to the right as more people felt that
rising home values increased their overall wealth. Many homeowners took
on mortgages that exceeded their ability to pay because, as home values
continued to rise, the increased value would pay off any debt
outstanding. Increased wealth due to rising home values lead to
increased home equity loans and increased spending. All these activities
pushed AD to the right, contributing to low unemployment rates and
economic growth in the United States. When the housing bubble burst,
overall wealth dropped dramatically, wiping out the recent gains. This
drop in home values was a demand shock to the U.S. economy because of
its impact directly on the wealth of the household sector, and its
contagion into the financial that essentially locked up new credit. The
AD curve shifted to the left as evidenced by the Great Recession’s
rising unemployment.</p>
<p>Understanding the source of these macroeconomic fluctuations provided
monetary and fiscal policy makers with insight about what policy actions
to take to mitigate the impact of the housing crisis. From a monetary
policy perspective, the Federal Reserve lowered short-term interest
rates to between 0% and 0.25 %, to loosen up credit throughout the
financial system. Discretionary fiscal policy measures included the
passage of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 that allowed
for the purchase of troubled assets, such as mortgages, from financial
institutions and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 that
increased government spending on infrastructure, provided for tax cuts,
and increased transfer payments. In combination, both monetary and
fiscal policy measures were designed to help stimulate aggregate demand
in the U.S. economy, pushing the AD curve to the right.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark952" class="s84">While most economists agree on the usefulness of the AD/AS diagram in analyzing the sources of these fluctuations, there is still some disagreement about the effectiveness of policy decisions that are useful in stabilizing these fluctuations.

<p>KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY</p>
<ol>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark861" class="a">Macroeconomic Perspectives on Demand and</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark861">Supply</a></p>
<p>Neoclassical economists emphasize Say’s law, which holds that supply
creates its own demand. Keynesian economists emphasize Keynes’ law,
which holds that demand creates its own supply. Many mainstream
economists take a Keynesian perspective, emphasizing the importance
of aggregate demand, for the short run, and a neoclassical
perspective, emphasizing the importance of aggregate supply, for the
long run.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark871" class="a">Building a Model of Aggregate Demand and Aggregate</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark871">Supply</a></p>
<p>The upward-sloping short run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve shows the
positive relationship between the price level and the level of real
GDP in the short run. Aggregate supply slopes up because when the
price level for outputs increases, while the price level of inputs
remains fixed, the opportunity for additional profits encourages
more production. The aggregate supply curve is near-horizontal on
the left and near-vertical on the right. In the long run,</p>
<p>we show the aggregate supply by a vertical line at the level of
potential output, which is the maximum level of output the economy
can produce with its existing levels of workers, physical capital,
technology, and economic institutions.</p>
<p>The downward-sloping aggregate demand (AD) curve shows the
relationship between the price level for outputs and the quantity of
total spending in the economy. It slopes down because of: (a) the
wealth effect, which means that a higher price level leads to lower
real wealth, which reduces the level of consumption; (b) the
interest rate effect, which holds that a higher price level will
mean a greater demand for money, which will tend to drive up
interest rates and reduce investment spending; and (c) the foreign
price effect, which holds that a rise in the price level will make
domestic goods relatively more expensive, discouraging exports and
encouraging imports.</p>

<li><p><a href="#bookmark888" class="a">Shifts in Aggregate</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark888">Supply</a></p>
<p>The aggregate demand/aggregate supply (AD/AS) diagram shows how AD
and AS interact. The intersection of the AD and AS curves shows the
equilibrium output and price level in the economy. Movements of
either AS or AD will result in a different equilibrium output and
price level. The aggregate supply curve will shift out to the right
as productivity increases. It will shift back to the left as the
price of key inputs rises, and will shift out to the right if the
price of key inputs falls. If the AS curve shifts back to the left,
the combination of lower output, higher unemployment, and higher
inflation, called stagflation, occurs. If AS shifts out to the
right, a combination of lower inflation, higher output, and lower
unemployment is possible.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark893" class="a">Shifts in Aggregate</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark893">Demand</a></p>
<p>The AD curve will shift out as the components of aggregate demand—C,
I, G, and X–M—rise. It will shift back to the left as these
components fall. These factors can change because of different
personal choices, like those resulting from consumer or business
confidence, or from policy choices like changes in government
spending and taxes. If the AD curve shifts to the right, then the
equilibrium quantity of output and the price level will rise. If the
AD curve shifts to the left, then the equilibrium quantity of output
and the price level will fall. Whether equilibrium output changes
relatively more than the price level or whether the price level
changes relatively more than output is determined by where the AD
curve intersects with the AS curve.</p>
<p>The AD/AS diagram superficially resembles the microeconomic supply
and demand diagram on the surface, but in reality, what is on the
horizontal and vertical axes and the underlying economic reasons for
the shapes of the curves are very different. We can illustrate
long-term economic growth in the AD/AS framework by a gradual shift
of the aggregate supply curve to the right. We illustrate a
recession when the intersection of AD and AS is substantially below
potential GDP, while we illustrate an expanding economy when the
intersection of AS and AD is near potential GDP.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark900" class="a">How the AD/AS Model Incorporates Growth, Unemployment, and</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark900">Inflation</a></p>
<p>Cyclical unemployment is relatively large in the AD/AS framework
when the equilibrium is substantially below potential GDP. Cyclical
unemployment is small in the AD/AS framework when the equilibrium is
near potential GDP. The natural rate of unemployment, as determined
by the labor market institutions of the economy, is built into what
economists mean by potential GDP, but does not otherwise appear in
an AD/AS diagram. The AD/AS framework shows pressures for inflation
to rise or fall when the movement from one equilibrium to another
causes the price level to rise or to fall. The balance of trade does
not appear directly in the AD/AS diagram, but it appears indirectly
in several ways. Increases in exports or declines in imports can
cause shifts in AD. Changes in the price of key imported inputs to
production, like oil, can cause shifts in AS. The AD/AS model is the
key model we use in this book to understand macroeconomic issues.</p>

<li><p><a href="#bookmark905" class="a">Keynes’ Law and Say’s Law in the AD/AS</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark905">Model</a></p></li>
</ol>
<p>We can divide the SRAS curve into three zones. Keynes’ law says demand
creates its own supply, so that changes in aggregate demand cause
changes in real GDP and employment. We can show Keynes’ law on the
horizontal Keynesian zone of the aggregate supply curve. The Keynesian
zone occurs at the left of the SRAS curve where it is fairly flat, so
movements in AD will affect output, but have little effect on the price
level. Say’s law says supply creates its own demand. Changes in
aggregate demand have no effect on real GDP and employment, only on the
price level. We can show Say’s law on the vertical neoclassical zone of
the aggregate supply curve. The neoclassical zone occurs at the right of
the SRAS curve where it is fairly vertical, and so movements in AD will
affect the price level, but have little impact on output. The
intermediate zone in the middle of the SRAS curve is upward-sloping, so
a rise in AD will cause higher output and price level, while a fall in
AD will lead to a lower output and price level.</p>

<p>CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Why would an economist choose either the neoclassical
perspective or the Keynesian perspective, but not both?</p></li>
<li><p>On a microeconomic demand curve, a decrease in price causes an
increase in quantity demanded because the product in question is
now relatively less expensive than substitute products. Explain
why aggregate demand does not increase for the same reason in
response to a decrease in the aggregate price level. In other
words, what causes total spending to increase if it is not
because goods are now cheaper?</p></li>
<li><p>Economists expect that as the labor market continues to tighten
going into the latter part of 2015 that workers should begin to
expect wage increases in 2015 and 2016. Assuming this occurs and
it was the only development in the labor market that year, how
would this affect the AS curve? What if it was also accompanied
by an increase in worker productivity?</p></li>

<p>The Great Recession</p>
<p>The 2008-2009 Great Recession hit the U.S. economy hard. According to
the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the number of unemployed Americans
rose from 6.8 million in May 2007 to 15.4 million in October 2009.
During that time, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated that approximately
170,000 small businesses closed. Mass layoffs peaked in February 2009
when employers gave 326,392 workers notice. U.S. productivity and output
fell as well. Job losses, declining home values, declining incomes, and
uncertainty about the future caused consumption expenditures to
decrease. According to the BLS, household spending dropped by 7.8%.</p>
<p>Home foreclosures and the meltdown in U.S. financial markets called for
immediate action by Congress, the President, and the Federal Reserve
Bank. For example, the government implemented programs such as the
American Restoration and Recovery Act to help millions of people by
providing tax credits for homebuyers, paying “cash for clunkers,” and
extending unemployment benefits. From cutting back on spending, filing
for unemployment, and losing homes, millions of people were affected by
the recession. While the United States is now on the path to recovery,
people will feel the impact for many years to come.</p>
<p>What caused this recession and what prevented the economy from spiraling
further into another depression? Policymakers looked to the lessons
learned from the 1930s Great Depression and to John Maynard Keynes’
models to analyze the causes and find solutions to the country’s
economic woes. The Keynesian perspective is the subject of this chapter.</p>

Analysis</span><span id="bookmark954">‌</span></p>
<p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Explain real GDP, recessionary gaps, and inflationary gaps</p></li>
<li><p>Recognize the Keynesian AD/AS model</p></li>
<li><p>Identify the determining factors of both consumption expenditure
and investment expenditure</p></li>
<li><p>Analyze the factors that determine government spending and net
exports</p>
<p><span id="bookmark955">The Keynesian perspective focuses on
aggregate demand. The idea is simple: firms produce output only
if they expect it to sell. Thus, while the availability of the
factors of production determines a nation’s potential GDP, the
amount of</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark956">goods and services that actually sell,
known as</span> <strong>real GDP</strong>, depends on how much demand exists
across the economy.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark957" class="a">Figure 12.3</a> <span
class="p">illustrates this point.</span></p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_264.jpg" width="224" height="179" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark957">Figure 12.3 The Keynesian AD/AS
Model</span> <span class="s37">The Keynesian View of the AD/AS
Model uses an SRAS curve, which is horizontal at levels of
output below potential and vertical at potential output. Thus,
when beginning from potential output, any decrease in AD affects
only output, but not prices. Any increase in AD affects only
prices, not output.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark958">Keynes argued that, for reasons we
explain shortly, aggregate demand is not stable—that it can
change unexpectedly. Suppose the economy starts where AD
intersects SRAS at P</span><span class="s60">0</span> and Yp.
Because Yp is potential output, the economy is at full
employment. Because AD is volatile, it can easily fall. Thus,
even if we start at Yp, if AD falls, then we find ourselves in
what Keynes termed a <strong>recessionary gap</strong>. The economy is in
equilibrium but with less than full employment, as Y<span
class="s60">1</span> <a href="#bookmark957" class="s34">in</a>
<a href="#bookmark957" class="a">Figure 12.3</a><span
class="s54"> </span>shows. Keynes believed that the economy
would tend to stay in a recessionary gap, with its attendant
unemployment, for a significant period of time.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark959">In the same way (although we do not show
it in the figure), if AD increases, the economy could experience
an</span> <strong>inflationary gap</strong>, where demand is attempting to
push the economy past potential output. Consequently, the
economy experiences inflation. The key policy implication for
either situation is that government needs to step in and close
the gap, increasing spending during recessions and decreasing
spending during booms to return aggregate demand to match
potential output.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark856" id="bookmark960" class="s34">Recall from</a>
<a href="#bookmark856" class="a">The Aggregate Supply-Aggregate Demand</a>
Model
<a href="#bookmark1788" class="s34">that aggregate demand is total spending, economy-wide, on domestic goods and services. (Aggregate demand (AD) is actually what economists call total planned expenditure. Read the appendix on</a>
<a href="#bookmark1788" class="a">The Expenditure-Output Model</a>
<span class="p">for more on this.) You may also remember that
aggregate demand is the sum of four components: consumption
expenditure, investment expenditure, government spending, and
spending on net exports (exports minus imports). In the
following sections, we will examine each component through the
Keynesian perspective.</span></p>
<p>What Determines Consumption Expenditure?</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark432" id="bookmark961" class="s34">Consumption expenditure is spending by households and individuals on durable goods, nondurable goods, and services. Durable goods are items that last and provide value over time, such as automobiles. Nondurable goods are things like groceries—once you consume them, they are gone. Recall from</a>
<a href="#bookmark432" class="a">The Macroeconomic</a>
Perspective <span class="p">that services are intangible things
consumers buy, like healthcare or entertainment.</span></p>
<p>Keynes identified three factors that affect consumption:</p>
</li>
<li><p><span id="bookmark962">Disposable income: For most people, the
single most powerful determinant of how much they consume is how
much income they have in their take-home pay, also known
as</span> <strong>disposable income</strong>, which is income after taxes.</p></li>
<li><p>Expected future income: Consumer expectations about future
income also are important in determining consumption. If
consumers feel optimistic about the future, they are more likely
to spend and increase overall aggregate demand. News of
recession and troubles in the economy will make them pull back
on consumption.</p></li>
<li><p>Wealth or credit: When households experience a rise in wealth,
they may be willing to consume a higher share of their income
and to save less. When the U.S. stock market rose dramatically
in the late 1990s, for example,</p>
<p>U.S. savings rates declined, probably in part because people
felt that their wealth had increased and there was less need to
save. How do people spend beyond their income, when they
perceive their wealth increasing? The answer is borrowing. On
the other side, when the U.S. stock market declined about 40%
from March 2008 to</p>
<p>March 2009, people felt far greater uncertainty about their
economic future, so savings rates increased while consumption
declined.</p>

style=" color: #000;">for more information about how the
recession affected various groups of people.</span></p>
<p>Finally, Keynes noted that a variety of other factors combine to
determine how much people save and spend. If household
preferences about saving shift in a way that encourages
consumption rather than saving, then AD will shift out to the
right.</p>
<p>What Determines Investment Expenditure?</p>
<p><span id="bookmark963">We call spending on new capital goods
investment expenditure. Investment falls into four categories:
producer’s durable equipment and software, nonresidential
structures (such as factories, offices, and retail locations),
changes in inventories, and residential structures (such as
single-family homes, townhouses, and apartment buildings).
Businesses conduct the first three types of investment, while
households conduct the last.</span></p>
<p>Keynes’s treatment of investment focuses on the key role of
expectations about the future in influencing business decisions.
When a business decides to make an investment in physical
assets, like plants or equipment, or in intangible assets, like
skills or a research and development project, that firm
considers both the expected investment benefits (future profit
expectations) and the investment costs (interest rates).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Expectations of future profits: The clearest driver of
investment benefits is expectations for future profits. When we
expect an economy to grow, businesses perceive a growing market
for their products. Their higher degree of business confidence
will encourage new investment. For example, in the second half
of the 1990s,</p>
<p>U.S. investment levels surged from 18% of GDP in 1994 to 21%
in 2000. However, when a recession started in 2001, U.S.
investment levels quickly sank back to 18% of GDP by 2002.</p>
</li>
<li><p><span id="bookmark964">Interest rates also play a significant
role in determining how much investment a firm will make. Just
as individuals need to borrow money to purchase homes, so
businesses need financing when they purchase big ticket items.
The cost of investment thus includes the interest rate. Even if
the firm has the funds, the interest rate measures the
opportunity cost of purchasing business capital. Lower interest
rates stimulate investment spending and higher interest rates
reduce it.</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Many factors can affect the expected profitability on investment.
For example, if the energy prices decline, then investments that use
energy as an input will yield higher profits. If government offers
special incentives for investment (for example, through the tax
code), then investment will look more attractive; conversely, if
government removes special investment incentives from the tax code,
or increases other business taxes, then investment will look less
attractive. As Keynes noted, business investment is the most
variable of all the components of aggregate demand.</p>
<p>What Determines Government Spending?</p>
<p><a href="http://cnx.org/content/m63688/latest/" class="s34">The third component of aggregate demand is federal, state, and local government spending. Although we usually view the United States as a market economy, government still plays a significant role in the economy. As we discuss in</a>
<a href="http://cnx.org/content/m63688/latest/" class="a">Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities (http://cnx.org/content/m63688/latest/)</a>
<a href="http://cnx.org/content/m63697/latest/" class="s34">and</a>
<a href="http://cnx.org/content/m63697/latest/" class="a">Positive Externalitites and Public Goods (http://cnx.org/content/m63697/latest/)</a>
<span class="p">, government provides important public services such
as national defense, transportation infrastructure, and
education.</span></p>
<p>Keynes recognized that the government budget offered a powerful tool
for influencing aggregate demand. Not only could more government
spending stimulate AD (or less government spending reduce it), but
lowering or raising tax rates could influence consumption and
investment spending. Keynes concluded that during extreme times like
deep recessions, only the government had the power and resources to
move aggregate demand.</p>
<p>What Determines Net Exports?</p>
<p><span id="bookmark965">Recall that exports are domestically produced
products that sell abroad while imports are foreign produced
products that consumers purchase domestically. Since we define
aggregate demand as spending on domestic goods and services, export
expenditures add to AD, while import expenditures subtract from
AD.</span></p>
<p>Two sets of factors can cause shifts in export and import demand:
changes in relative growth rates between countries and changes in
relative prices between countries. What is happening in the
countries’ economies that would be purchasing those exports heavily
affects the level of demand for a nation’s exports. For example, if
major importers of American-made products like Canada, Japan, and
Germany have recessions, exports of U.S. products to those countries
are likely to decline. Conversely, the amount of income in the
domestic economy directly affects the quantity of a nation’s
imports: more income will bring a higher level of imports.</p>
<p>Relative prices of goods in domestic and international markets can
also affect exports and imports. If U.S. goods are relatively
cheaper compared with goods made in other places, perhaps because a
group of U.S. producers has mastered certain productivity
breakthroughs, then U.S. exports are likely to rise. If U.S. goods
become relatively more expensive, perhaps because a change in the
exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and other currencies has
pushed up the price of inputs to production in the United States,
then exports from U.S. producers are likely to decline.</p>

</ul>
<p><a href="#bookmark1788" class="s34">Now that we have a clear understanding of what constitutes aggregate demand, we return to the Keynesian argument using the model of aggregate demand/aggregate supply (AD/AS). (For a similar treatment using Keynes’ income- expenditure model, see the appendix on</a>
<a href="#bookmark1788" class="a">The Expenditure-Output</a>
Model<span class="p">.)</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark968">Keynesian economics focuses on explaining why
recessions and depressions occur and offering a policy prescription
for minimizing their effects. The Keynesian view of recession is
based on two key building blocks. First, aggregate demand is not
always automatically high enough to provide firms with an incentive
to hire enough workers to reach full employment. Second, the
macroeconomy may adjust only slowly to shifts in aggregate demand
because of</span> <strong>sticky wages and prices</strong>, which are wages and
prices that do not respond to decreases or increases in demand. We
will consider these two claims in turn, and then see how they are
represented in the AD/AS model.<span id="bookmark969">‌</span></p>
<p>The first building block of the Keynesian diagnosis is that
recessions occur when the level of demand for goods and services is
less than what is produced when labor is fully employed. In other
words, the intersection of aggregate supply and aggregate demand
occurs at a level of output less than the level of GDP consistent
with full employment. Suppose the stock market crashes, as in 1929,
or suppose the housing market collapses, as in 2008. In either case,
household wealth will decline, and consumption expenditure will
follow. Suppose businesses see that consumer spending is falling.
That will reduce expectations of the profitability of investment, so
businesses will decrease investment expenditure.</p>
<p>This seemed to be the case during the Great Depression, since the
physical capacity of the economy to supply goods did not alter much.
No flood or earthquake or other natural disaster ruined factories in
1929 or 1930. No outbreak of disease decimated the ranks of workers.
No key input price, like the price of oil, soared on world markets.
The U.S. economy in 1933 had just about the same factories, workers,
and state of technology as it had had four years earlier in 1929—and
yet the economy had shrunk dramatically. This also seems to be what
happened in 2008.</p>

<span style=" color: #000;">for raw data used to calculate
GDP.</span></p>
<p>As Keynes recognized, the events of the Depression contradicted
Say’s law that “supply creates its own demand.” Although production
capacity existed, the markets were not able to sell their products.
As a result, real GDP was less than potential GDP.</p>
<p>Wage and Price Stickiness</p>
<p>Keynes also pointed out that although AD fluctuated, prices and
wages did not immediately respond as economists often expected.
Instead, prices and wages are “sticky,” making it difficult to
restore the economy to full employment</p>
<p><span id="bookmark970">and potential GDP. Keynes emphasized one
particular reason why wages were sticky: the</span> <strong>coordination
argument</strong><a href="#bookmark619" class="s34">. This argument points out that, even if most people would be willing—at least hypothetically—to see a decline in their own wages in bad economic times as long as everyone else also experienced such a decline, a market-oriented economy has no obvious way to implement a plan of coordinated wage reductions.</a>
<a href="#bookmark619" class="a">Unemployment</a><span class="s54">
</span>proposed a number of reasons why wages might be sticky
downward, most of which center on the argument that businesses avoid
wage cuts because they may in one way or another depress morale and
hurt the productivity of the existing workers.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark971">Some modern economists have argued in a
Keynesian spirit that, along with wages, other prices may be sticky,
too. Many firms do not change their prices every day or even every
month. When a firm considers changing prices, it must consider two
sets of costs. First, changing prices uses company resources:
managers must analyze the competition and market demand and decide
the new prices, they must update sales materials, change billing
records, and redo product and price labels. Second, frequent price
changes may leave customers confused or angry—especially if they
discover that a product now costs more than they expected. These
costs of changing prices are called</span> <strong>menu costs</strong>—like the
costs of printing a new set of menus with different prices in a
restaurant. Prices do respond to forces of supply and demand, but
from a macroeconomic perspective, the process of changing all prices
throughout the economy takes time.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark972" class="s34">To understand the effect of sticky wages and prices in the economy, consider</a>

occurs at the intersection of the demand curve (D<span

for labor shifts to the left (to D<span

<a href="#bookmark972" class="a">Figure 12.4</a><span class="s54">

remains at its original level (W<span class="s60">0</span>) for a
period of time and the price remains at its original level (P<span
class="s60">0</span>).</p>
<p>As a result, a situation of excess supply—where the quantity
supplied exceeds the quantity demanded at the existing wage or
price—exists in markets for both labor and goods, and Q<span

who are willing to work at the existing market wage. The Clear

However, the wage in (a) and the price in (b) do not immediately
decline. In (a), the quantity demanded of labor at the original

excess supply of labor will exist, which we call unemployment.
An excess supply of goods will also exist, where the quantity

sticky wages and sticky prices, combined with a drop in demand,
bring about unemployment and recession.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_268.png" width="624" height="669" alt="image" />
<p>Why Is the Pace of Wage Adjustments Slow?</p>
<p>The recovery after the Great Recession in the United States has
been slow, with wages stagnant, if not declining. In fact, many
low-wage workers at McDonalds, Dominos, and Walmart have
threatened to strike for higher wages. Their plight is part of a
larger trend in job growth and pay in the post–recession
recovery.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark973">Figure 12.5 Jobs Lost/Gained in the
Recession/Recovery</span> <span class="s37">Data in the
aftermath of the Great Recession suggests that jobs lost were in
mid-wage occupations, while jobs gained were in low-wage
occupations.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark973" class="s84">The National Employment Law Project compiled data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and found that, during the Great Recession, 60% of job losses were in medium-wage occupations. Most of them were replaced during the recovery period with lower-wage jobs in the service, retail, and food industries.</a>
<a href="#bookmark973" class="s43">Figure</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>illustrates this data.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Wages in the service, retail, and food industries are at or near minimum
wage and tend to be both downwardly and upwardly “sticky.” Wages are
downwardly sticky due to minimum wage laws. They may be upwardly sticky
if insufficient competition in low-skilled labor markets enables
employers to avoid raising wages that would reduce their profits. At the
same time, however, the Consumer Price Index increased 11% between 2007
and 2012, pushing real wages down.</p>
<p>The Two Keynesian Assumptions in the AD/AS Model</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark975" id="bookmark974" class="a">Figure 12.6</a>
<a href="#bookmark975" class="s34">is the AD/AS diagram which illustrates these two Keynesian assumptions—the importance of aggregate demand in causing recession and the stickiness of wages and prices. Note that because of the stickiness of wages and prices, the aggregate supply curve is flatter than either supply curve (labor or specific good). In fact, if wages and prices were so sticky that they did not fall at all, the aggregate supply curve would be completely flat below potential GDP, as</a>
<a href="#bookmark975" class="a">Figure 12.6</a> <span class="p">shows.
This outcome is an important example of a </span><span
class="s31">macroeconomic externality</span><span class="p">, where what
happens at the macro level is different from and inferior to what
happens at the micro level. For example, a firm should respond to a
decrease in demand for its product by cutting its price to increase
sales. However, if all firms experience a decrease in demand for their
products, sticky prices in the aggregate prevent aggregate demand from
rebounding (which we would show as a movement along the AD curve in
response to a lower price level).</span></p>
<p>The original equilibrium of this economy occurs where the aggregate
demand function (AD<span class="s60">0</span>) intersects with AS. Since
this intersection occurs at potential GDP (Yp), the economy is operating
at full employment. When aggregate</p>
<p>demand shifts to the left, all the adjustment occurs through decreased
real GDP. There is no decrease in the price level. Since the equilibrium
occurs at Y<span class="s60">1</span>, the economy experiences
substantial unemployment.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_269.jpg" width="224" height="179" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark975"><span class="s36">Figure 12.6 A Keynesian
Perspective of Recession </span></span>This figure illustrates the two
key assumptions behind Keynesian economics. A recession begins when
aggregate demand declines from AD<span class="s63">0</span> to AD<span
class="s63">1</span>. The recession persists because of the assumption
of fixed wages and prices, which makes the SRAS flat below potential
GDP. If that were not the case, the price level would fall also, raising
GDP and limiting the recession. Instead the intersection E<span
class="s63">1</span> occurs in the flat portion of the SRAS curve where
GDP is less than potential.</p>
<p>The Expenditure Multiplier</p>
<p><span id="bookmark976">A key concept in Keynesian economics is
the</span> <strong>expenditure multiplier</strong>. The expenditure multiplier is the
idea that not only does spending affect the equilibrium level of GDP,
but that spending is powerful. More precisely, it means that a change in
spending causes a more than proportionate change in GDP.</p>
<p>&gt; 1</p>
<p>ΔY      <span class="s16"> ΔSpending</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1788" id="bookmark977" class="s34">The reason for the expenditure multiplier is that one person’s spending becomes another person’s income, which leads to additional spending and additional income so that the cumulative impact on GDP is larger than the initial increase in spending. The appendix on</a>
<a href="#bookmark1788" class="a">The Expenditure-Output Model</a> <span
class="p">provides the details of the multiplier process, but the
concept is important enough for us to summarize here. While the
multiplier is important for understanding the effectiveness of fiscal
policy, it occurs whenever any autonomous increase in spending occurs.
Additionally, the multiplier operates in a negative as well as a
positive direction. Thus, when investment spending collapsed during the
Great Depression, it caused a much larger decrease in real GDP. The size
of the multiplier is critical and was a key element in discussions of
the effectiveness of the Obama administration’s fiscal stimulus package,
officially titled the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of
2009.</span></p>

<p><a href="#bookmark979" class="s34">The simplified AD/AS model that we have used so far is fully consistent with Keynes’s original model. More recent research, though, has indicated that in the real world, an aggregate supply curve is more curved than the right angle that we used in this chapter. Rather, the real-world AS curve is very flat at levels of output far below potential (“the Keynesian zone”), very steep at levels of output above potential (“the neoclassical zone”) and curved in between (“the intermediate zone”).</a>
<a href="#bookmark979" class="a">Figure 12.7</a> <span

class="s37">Near the equilibrium Ek, in the Keynesian zone at
the SRAS curve’s far left, small shifts in AD, either to the
right or the left, will affect the output level Yk, but will not
much affect the price level. In the Keynesian zone, AD largely
determines the quantity of output. Near the equilibrium En, in
the neoclassical zone, at the SRAS curve’s far right, small
shifts in AD, either to the right or the left, will have
relatively little effect on the output level Yn, but instead
will have a greater effect on the price level. In the
neoclassical zone, the near-vertical SRAS curve close to the
level of potential GDP (as represented by the LRAS line) largely
determines the quantity of output. In the intermediate zone
around equilibrium Ei, movement in AD to the right will increase
both the output level and the price level, while a movement in
AD to the left would decrease both the output level and the
price level.</span></p>
<p>The Discovery of the Phillips Curve</p>
<p><span id="bookmark980">In the 1950s, A.W. Phillips, an economist
at the London School of Economics, was studying the Keynesian
analytical framework. The Keynesian theory implied that during a
recession inflationary pressures are low, but when the level of
output is at or even pushing beyond potential GDP, the economy
is at greater risk for inflation. Phillips analyzed 60 years of
British data and did find that tradeoff between unemployment and
inflation, which became known as the</span> <strong>Phillips
curve</strong><a href="#bookmark982" class="s34">.</a>

appeared to break down during the 1970s as the Phillips Curve
shifted out to the right.</span></p>
<p>Over this longer period of time, the Phillips curve appears to
have shifted out. There is no tradeoff any more.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark985">The Instability of the Phillips
Curve</span></p>
<p>During the 1960s, economists viewed the Phillips curve as a
policy menu. A nation could choose low inflation and high
unemployment, or high inflation and low unemployment, or
anywhere in between. Economies could use fiscal and monetary
policy to move up or down the Phillips curve as desired. Then a
curious thing happened. When policymakers tried to exploit the
tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, the result was an
increase in both inflation and unemployment. What had happened?
The Phillips curve shifted.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark856" id="bookmark986" class="s34">The U.S. economy experienced this pattern in the deep recession from 1973 to 1975, and again in back-to-back recessions from 1980 to 1982. Many nations around the world saw similar increases in unemployment and inflation. This pattern became known as stagflation. (Recall from</a>
<a href="#bookmark856" class="a">The Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply</a>
Model <span class="p">that stagflation is an unhealthy
combination of high unemployment and high inflation.) Perhaps
most important, stagflation was a phenomenon that traditional
Keynesian economics could not explain.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark987">Economists have concluded that two
factors cause the Phillips curve to shift. The first is supply
shocks, like the mid-1970s oil crisis, which first brought
stagflation into our vocabulary. The second is changes in
people’s expectations about inflation. In other words, there may
be a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment when people
expect no inflation, but when they realize inflation is
occurring, the tradeoff disappears. Both factors (supply shocks
and changes in inflationary expectations) cause the aggregate
supply curve, and thus the Phillips curve, to shift.</span></p>
<p>In short, we should interpret a downward-sloping Phillips curve
as valid for short-run periods of several years, but over longer
periods, when aggregate supply shifts, the downward-sloping
Phillips curve can shift so that unemployment and inflation are
both higher (as in the 1970s and early 1980s) or both lower (as
in the early 1990s or first decade of the 2000s).</p>
<p>Keynesian Policy for Fighting Unemployment and Inflation</p>
<p><span id="bookmark988">Keynesian macroeconomics argues that the
solution to a recession is</span> <strong>expansionary fiscal
policy</strong><a href="#bookmark990" class="s34">, such as tax cuts to stimulate consumption and investment, or direct increases in government spending that would shift the aggregate demand curve to the right. For example, if aggregate demand was originally at ADr in</a>
<a href="#bookmark990" class="a">Figure</a> <span
class="s54">12.11</span>, so that the economy was in recession,
the appropriate policy would be for government to shift
aggregate demand to the right from ADr to ADf, where the economy
would be at potential GDP and full employment.</p>
<p>Keynes noted that while it would be nice if the government could
spend additional money on housing, roads, and other amenities,
he also argued that if the government could not agree on how to
spend money in practical ways, then it could spend in
impractical ways. For example, Keynes suggested building
monuments, like a modern</p>
<p><span id="bookmark989">equivalent of the Egyptian pyramids. He
proposed that the government could bury money underground, and
let mining companies start digging up the money again. These
suggestions were slightly tongue-in-cheek, but their purpose was
to emphasize that a Great Depression is no time to quibble over
the specifics of government spending programs and tax cuts when
the goal should be to pump up aggregate demand by enough to lift
the economy to potential GDP.</span></p>

<p><span id="bookmark990">Figure 12.11 Fighting Recession and
Inflation with Keynesian Policy</span> <span class="s37">If an
economy is in recession, with an equilibrium at Er, then the
Keynesian response would be to enact a policy to shift aggregate

ADf.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark991">The other side of Keynesian policy occurs

policy</strong><a href="#bookmark990" class="s34">, using tax increases or government spending cuts to shift AD to the left. The result would be downward pressure on the price level, but very little reduction in output or very little rise in unemployment. If aggregate demand was originally at ADi in</a>
<a href="#bookmark990" class="a">Figure</a> <span
class="s54">12.11</span>, so that the economy was experiencing
inflationary rises in the price level, the appropriate policy
would be for government to shift aggregate demand to the left,
from ADi toward ADf, which reduces the pressure for a higher
price level while the economy remains at full employment.</p>
<p>In the Keynesian economic model, too little aggregate demand
brings unemployment and too much brings inflation. Thus, you can
think of Keynesian economics as pursuing a “Goldilocks” level of
aggregate demand: not too much, not too little, but looking for
what is just right.</p>

<p>Ever since the birth of Keynesian economics in the 1930s, controversy
has simmered over the extent to which government should play an active
role in managing the economy. In the aftermath of the human devastation
and misery of the Great Depression, many people—including many
economists—became more aware of vulnerabilities within the
market-oriented economic system. Some supporters of Keynesian economics
advocated a high degree of government planning in all parts of the
economy.</p>
<p>However, Keynes himself was careful to separate the issue of aggregate
demand from the issue of how well individual markets worked. He argued
that individual markets for goods and services were appropriate and
useful, but that sometimes that level of aggregate demand was just too
low. When 10 million people are willing and able to work, but one
million of them are unemployed, he argued, individual markets may be
doing a perfectly good job of allocating the efforts of the nine million
workers—the problem is that insufficient aggregate demand exists to
support jobs for all 10 million. Thus, he believed that, while
government should ensure that overall level of aggregate demand is
sufficient for an economy to reach full employment, this task did not
imply that the government should attempt to set prices and wages
throughout the economy, nor to take over and manage large corporations
or entire industries directly.</p>

<p>The Great Recession</p>
<p>The lessons learned during the 1930s Great Depression and the aggregate
expenditure model that John Maynard Keynes proposed gave the modern
economists and policymakers of today the tools to effectively navigate
the treacherous economy in the latter half of the 2000s. In “How the
Great Recession Was Brought to an End”, Alan S. Blinder and Mark Zandi
wrote that the actions taken by today’s policymakers stand in sharp
contrast to those of the early years of the Great Depression. Today’s
economists and policymakers were not content to let the markets recover
from recession without taking proactive measures to support consumption
and investment. The Federal Reserve actively lowered short-term interest
rates and developed innovative ways to pump money into the economy so
that credit and investment would not dry up. Both Presidents Bush and
Obama and Congress implemented a variety of programs ranging from tax
rebates to “Cash for Clunkers” to the Troubled Asset Relief Program to
stimulate and stabilize household consumption and encourage investment.
Although these policies came under harsh criticism from the public and
many politicians, they lessened the impact of the economic downturn and
may have saved the country from a second Great Depression.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1384" class="s34">Even if one accepts the Keynesian economic theory, a number of practical questions remain. In the real world, can government economists identify potential GDP accurately? Is a desired increase in aggregate demand better accomplished by a tax cut or by an increase in government spending? Given the inevitable delays and uncertainties as governments enact policies into law, is it reasonable to expect that the government can implement Keynesian economics? Can fixing a recession really be just as simple as pumping up aggregate demand?</a>

<p>KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY</p>
<ol>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark954" class="a">Aggregate Demand in Keynesian</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark954">Analysis</a></p>
<p>Aggregate demand is the sum of four components: consumption,
investment, government spending, and net exports. Consumption will
change for a number of reasons, including movements in income,
taxes, expectations about future income, and changes in wealth
levels. Investment will change in response to its expected
profitability, which in turn is shaped by expectations about future
economic growth, the creation of new technologies, the price of key
inputs, and tax incentives for investment. Investment will also
change when interest rates rise or fall. Political considerations
determine government spending and taxes. Exports and imports change
according to relative growth rates and prices between two economies.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark967" class="a">The Building Blocks of Keynesian</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark967">Analysis</a></p>
<p>Keynesian economics is based on two main ideas: (1) aggregate demand
is more likely than aggregate supply to be the primary cause of a
short-run economic event like a recession; (2) wages and prices can
be sticky, and so, in an economic downturn, unemployment can result.
The latter is an example of a macroeconomic externality. While
surpluses cause prices to fall at the micro level, they do not
necessarily at the macro level. Instead the adjustment to a decrease
in demand occurs only through decreased quantities. One reason why
prices may be sticky is menu costs, the costs of changing prices.
These include internal costs a business faces in changing prices in
terms of labeling, recordkeeping, and accounting, and also the costs
of communicating the price change to (possibly unhappy) customers.
Keynesians also believe in the existence of the expenditure
multiplier—the notion that a change in autonomous expenditure causes
a more than proportionate change in GDP.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark978" class="a">The Phillips</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark978">Curve</a></p>
<p>A Phillips curve shows the tradeoff between unemployment and
inflation in an economy. From a Keynesian viewpoint, the Phillips
curve should slope down so that higher unemployment means lower
inflation, and vice versa. However, a downward-sloping Phillips
curve is a short-term relationship that may shift after a few years.</p>
<p>Keynesian macroeconomics argues that the solution to a recession is
expansionary fiscal policy, such as tax cuts to stimulate
consumption and investment, or direct increases in government
spending that would shift the aggregate demand curve to the right.
The other side of Keynesian policy occurs when the economy is
operating above potential GDP. In this situation, unemployment is
low, but inflationary rises in the price level are a concern. The
Keynesian response would be contractionary fiscal policy, using tax
increases or government spending cuts to shift AD to the left.</p>

<li><p><a href="#bookmark992" class="a">The Keynesian Perspective on Market</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark992">Forces</a></p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Keynesian prescription for stabilizing the economy implies
government intervention at the macroeconomic level—increasing aggregate
demand when private demand falls and decreasing aggregate demand when
private demand rises. This does not imply that the government should be
passing laws or regulations that set prices and quantities in
microeconomic markets.</p>

<p>Navigating Unchartered Waters</p>
<p>The Great Recession ended in June 2009 after 18 months, according to the
National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). The NBER examines a variety
of measures of economic activity to gauge the economy’s overall health.
These measures include real income, wholesale and retail sales,
employment, and industrial production. In the years since the official
end of this historic economic downturn, it has become clear that the
Great Recession was two-pronged, hitting the U.S. economy with the
collapse of the housing market and the failure of the financial system’s
credit institutions, further contaminating global economies. While the
stock market rapidly lost trillions of dollars of value, consumer
spending dried up, and companies began cutting jobs, economic
policymakers were struggling with how to best combat and prevent a
national, and even global economic collapse. In the end, policymakers
used a number of controversial monetary and fiscal policies to support
the housing market and domestic industries as well as to stabilize the
financial sector. Some of these initiatives included:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Federal Reserve Bank purchase of both traditional and nontraditional
assets off banks’ balance sheets. By doing this, the Fed injected
money into the banking system and increased the amounts of funds
available to lend to the business sector and consumers. This also
dropped short-term interest rates to as low as zero percent, which
had the effect of devaluing U.S. dollars in the global market and
boosting exports.</p></li>

legislation that would stabilize the</p></li>

areas of the economy that impact our daily lives. One of the most

<p>financial market. The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), passed in
late 2008, allowed the government to inject cash into troubled banks and
other financial institutions and help support General Motors and
Chrysler as they faced bankruptcy and threatened job losses throughout
their supply chain. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in early
2009 provided tax rebates to low- and middle-income households to
encourage consumer spending.</p>
<p>Four years after the end of the Great Recession, the economy has yet to
return to its pre-recession levels of productivity and growth. Annual
productivity increased only 1.9% between 2009 and 2012 compared to its
2.7% annual growth rate between 2000 and 2007, unemployment remains
above the natural rate, and real GDP continues to lag behind potential
growth. The actions the government has taken to stabilize the economy
are still under scrutiny and debate about their effectiveness continues.
In this chapter, we will discuss the neoclassical perspective on
economics and compare it to the Keynesian perspective. At the end of the
chapter, we will use the neoclassical perspective to analyze the actions
the government has taken in the Great Recession.</p>

<p>In Chicago, Illinois, the highest recorded temperature was 105° in July
1995, while the lowest recorded temperature was 27° below zero in
January 1958. Understanding why these extreme weather patterns occurred
would be interesting. However, if you wanted to understand the typical
weather pattern in Chicago, instead of focusing on one- time extremes,
you would need to look at the entire pattern of data over time.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1019">A similar lesson applies to the study of
macroeconomics. It is interesting to study extreme situations, like the
1930s Great Depression or what many have called the 2008-2009 Great
Recession. If you want to understand the whole picture, however, you
need to look at the long term. Consider the unemployment rate. The
unemployment rate has fluctuated from as low as 3.5% in 1969 to as high
as 9.7% in 1982 and 9.6% in 2009. Even as the U.S. unemployment rate
rose during recessions and declined during expansions, it kept returning
to the general neighborhood of 5.0–5.5%. When the nonpartisan
Congressional Budget Office carried out its long-range economic
forecasts in 2010, it assumed that from 2015 to 2020, after the
recession has passed, the unemployment rate would be 5.0%. From a
long-run perspective, the economy seems to keep adjusting back to this
rate of unemployment.</span></p>
<p>As the name “neoclassical” implies, this perspective of how the
macroeconomy works is a “new” view of the “old” classical model of the
economy. The classical view, the predominant economic philosophy until
the Great Depression, was that short-term fluctuations in economic
activity would rather quickly, with flexible prices, adjust back to full
employment. This view of the economy implied a vertical aggregate supply
curve at full employment GDP, and prescribed a “hands off” policy
approach. For example, if the economy were to slip into recession (a
leftward shift of the aggregate demand curve), it would temporarily
exhibit a surplus of goods. Falling prices would eliminate this surplus,
and the economy would return to full employment level of GDP. No active
fiscal or monetary policy was needed. In fact, the classical view was
that expansionary fiscal or monetary policy would only cause inflation,
rather than increase GDP. The deep and lasting impact of the Great
Depression changed this thinking and Keynesian economics, which
prescribed active fiscal policy to alleviate weak aggregate demand,
became the more mainstream perspective.</p>

</ul>
<p><span id="bookmark1021">The</span> <strong>neoclassical perspective</strong> on
macroeconomics holds that, in the long run, the economy will
fluctuate around its potential GDP and its natural rate of
unemployment. This chapter begins with two building blocks of
neoclassical economics: (1) potential GDP determines the economy’s
the size and (2) wages and prices will adjust in a flexible manner
so that the economy will adjust back to its potential GDP level of
output. The key policy implication is this: The government should
focus more on long-term growth and on controlling inflation than on
worrying about recession or cyclical unemployment. This focus on
long-run growth rather than the short-run fluctuations in the
business cycle means that neoclassical economics is more useful for
long-run macroeconomic analysis and Keynesian economics is more
useful for analyzing the macroeconomic short run. Let’s consider the
two neoclassical building blocks in turn, and how we can embody them
in the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model.<span
id="bookmark1022">‌</span><span id="bookmark1023">‌</span></p>
<p>The Importance of Potential GDP in the Long Run</p>
<p>Over the long run, the level of potential GDP determines the size of
real GDP. When economists refer to “potential GDP” they are
referring to that level of output that an economy can achieve when
all resources (land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurial ability)
are fully employed. While the unemployment rate in labor markets
will never be zero, full employment in the labor market refers to
zero cyclical unemployment. There will still be some level of
unemployment due to frictional or structural unemployment, but when
the economy is operating with zero cyclical unemployment, economists
say that the economy is at the natural rate of unemployment or at
full employment.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark537" id="bookmark1024" class="s34">Economists benchmark actual or real GDP against the potential GDP to determine how well the economy is performing. As explained in</a>
<a href="#bookmark537" class="a">Economic</a> <span
class="s54">Growth</span>, we can explain GDP growth by increases
and investment in physical capital and human capital per person as
well as advances in technology. <strong>Physical capital per person</strong>
refers to the amount and kind of machinery and equipment available
to help people get work done. Compare, for example, your
productivity in typing a term paper on a typewriter to working on
your laptop with word processing software. Clearly, you will be able
to be more productive using word processing software. The technology
and level of capital of your laptop and software has increased your
productivity. More broadly, the development of GPS technology and
Universal Product Codes (those barcodes on every product we buy) has
made it much easier for firms to track shipments, tabulate
inventories, and sell and distribute products. These two
technological innovations, and many others, have increased a
nation’s ability to produce goods and services for a given
population. Likewise, increasing human capital involves increasing
levels of knowledge, education, and skill sets per person through
vocational or higher education. Physical and human capital
improvements with technological advances will increase overall
productivity and, thus, GDP.<span id="bookmark1025">‌</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark1026">To see how these improvements have increased
productivity and output at the national level, we should examine
evidence from the United States. The United States experienced
significant growth in the twentieth century due to phenomenal
changes in infrastructure, equipment, and technological improvements
in physical capital and human capital. The population more than
tripled in the twentieth century, from 76 million in 1900 to over
300 million in 2016. The human capital of modern workers is far
higher today because the education and skills of workers have risen
dramatically. In 1900, only about one-eighth of the U.S. population
had completed high school and just one person in 40 had completed a
four-year college degree. By 2010, more than 87% of Americans had a
high school degree and over 29% had a four-year college degree as
well. In 2014, 40% of working-age Americans had a four-year college
degree. The average amount of physical capital per worker has grown
dramatically. The technology available to modern workers is
extraordinarily better than a century ago: cars, airplanes,
electrical machinery, smartphones, computers, chemical and
biological advances, materials science, health care—the list of
technological advances could run on and on. More workers, higher
skill levels, larger amounts of physical capital per worker, and
amazingly better technology, and potential GDP for the U.S. economy
has clearly increased a great deal since 1900.</span></p>
<p>This growth has fallen below its potential GDP and, at times, has
exceeded its potential. For example from 2008 to</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1027" class="s34">2009, the U.S. economy tumbled into recession and remains below its potential. At other times, like in the late 1990s, the economy ran at potential GDP—or even slightly ahead.</a>
<a href="#bookmark1027" class="a">Figure 13.2</a> <span
class="p">shows the actual data for the increase in real GDP
since 1960. The slightly smoother line shows the potential GDP since
1960 as estimated by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
Most economic recessions and upswings are times when the economy is
1–3% below or above potential GDP in a given year. Clearly,
short-run fluctuations around potential GDP do exist, but over the
long run, the upward trend of potential GDP determines the size of
the economy.</span></p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_278.jpg" width="589" height="365" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark1027">Figure 13.2 Potential and Actual GDP (in
2009 Dollars)</span> <span class="s37">Actual GDP falls below
potential GDP during and after recessions, like the recessions of
1980 and 1981–82, 1990–91, 2001, and 2008–2009 and continues below
potential GDP through 2016. In other cases, actual GDP can be above
potential GDP for a time, as in the late 1990s.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1030" id="bookmark1028" class="s34">In the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model, we show potential GDP as a vertical line. Neoclassical economists who focus on potential GDP as the primary determinant of real GDP argue that the long-run aggregate supply curve is located at potential GDP—that is, we draw the long-run aggregate supply curve as a vertical line at the level of potential GDP, as</a>
<a href="#bookmark1030" class="a">Figure 13.3</a> <span
class="p">shows. A vertical LRAS curve means that the level of
aggregate supply (or potential GDP) will determine the economy’s
real GDP, regardless of the level of aggregate demand. Over time,
increases in the quantity and quality of physical capital, increases
in human capital, and technological advancements shift potential GDP
and the vertical LRAS curve gradually to the right. Economists often
describe this gradual increase in an economy’s potential GDP as a
nation’s long-term economic growth.</span><span

class="s37">In the neoclassical model, we draw the aggregate supply
curve as a vertical line at the level of potential GDP. If AS is
vertical, then it determines the level of real output, no matter

expands.</span></p>
<p>The Role of Flexible Prices</p>
<p>How does the macroeconomy adjust back to its level of potential GDP
in the long run? What if aggregate demand increases or decreases?
Economists base the neoclassical view of how the macroeconomy
adjusts on the insight that even if wages and prices are “sticky”,
or slow to change, in the short run, they are flexible over time. To
understand this better, let’s follow the connections from the
short-run to the long-run macroeconomic equilibrium.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1031" class="s34">The aggregate demand and aggregate supply diagram in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1031" class="a">Figure 13.4</a><span class="s54">
</span>shows two aggregate supply curves. We draw the original
upward sloping aggregate supply curve (SRAS<span
class="s60">0</span>) is a short-run or Keynesian AS curve. The
vertical aggregate supply curve (LRASn) is the long-run or
neoclassical AS curve, which is located at potential GDP. The
original aggregate demand curve, labeled AD<span
class="s60">0</span>, so that the original equilibrium occurs at
point E<span class="s60">0</span>, at which point the economy is
producing at its potential GDP.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_280.jpg" width="301" height="274" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark1031"><span class="s36">Figure 13.4 The Rebound to
Potential GDP after AD Increases </span></span>The original
equilibrium (E<span class="s63">0</span>), at an output level of 500
and a price level of 120, happens at the intersection of the
aggregate demand curve (AD<span class="s63">0</span>) and the
short-run aggregate supply curve (SRAS<span class="s63">0</span>).
The output at E<span class="s63">0</span> is equal to potential GDP.
Aggregate demand shifts right from AD<span class="s63">0</span> to
AD<span class="s63">1</span>. The new equilibrium is E<span
class="s63">1</span>, with a higher output level of 550 and an
increase in the price level to 125. With unemployment rates
unsustainably low, eager employers bid up wages, which shifts
short-run aggregate supply to the left, from SRAS<span
class="s63">0</span> to SRAS<span class="s63">1</span>. The new
equilibrium (E<span class="s63">2</span>) is at the same original
level of output, 500, but at a higher price level of 130. Thus, the
long-run aggregate supply curve (LRASn), which is vertical at the
level of potential GDP, determines the level of real GDP in this
economy in the long run.</p>
<p>Now, imagine that some economic event boosts aggregate demand:
perhaps a surge of export sales or a rise in business confidence
that leads to more investment, perhaps a policy decision like higher
government spending, or perhaps a tax cut that leads to additional
aggregate demand. The short-run Keynesian analysis is that the rise
in aggregate demand will shift the aggregate demand curve out to the
right, from AD<span class="s60">0</span> to AD<span
class="s60">1</span>, leading to a new equilibrium at point E<span
class="s60">1</span> with higher output, lower unemployment, and
pressure for an inflationary rise in the price level.</p>
<p>In the long-run neoclassical analysis, however, the chain of
economic events is just beginning. As economic output rises above
potential GDP, the level of unemployment falls. The economy is now
above full employment and there is a labor shortage. Eager employers
are trying to bid workers away from other companies and to encourage
their current workers to exert more effort and to work longer hours.
This high demand for labor will drive up wages. Most employers
review their workers salaries only once or twice a year, and so it
will take time before the higher wages filter through the economy.
As wages do rise, it will mean a leftward shift in the short-run
Keynesian aggregate supply curve back to SRAS<span
class="s60">1</span>, because the price of a major input to
production has increased. The economy moves to a new equilibrium
(E<span class="s60">2</span>). The new equilibrium has the same
level of real GDP as did the original equilibrium (E<span
class="s60">0</span>), but there has been an inflationary increase
in the price level.</p>
<p>This description of the short-run shift from E<span
class="s60">0</span> to E<span class="s60">1</span> and the long-run
shift from E<span class="s60">1</span> to E<span
class="s60">2</span> is a step-by-step way of making a simple point:
the economy cannot sustain production above its potential GDP in the
long run. An economy may produce above its level of potential GDP in
the short run, under pressure from a surge in aggregate demand. Over
the long run, however, that surge in aggregate demand ends up as an
increase in the price level, not as a rise in output.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1032" class="s34">The rebound of the economy back to potential GDP also works in response to a shift to the left in aggregate demand.</a>
<a href="#bookmark1032" class="a">Figure 13.5</a><span class="s54">
</span>again starts with two aggregate supply curves, with SRAS<span
class="s60">0</span> showing the original upward sloping short-run
Keynesian AS curve and LRASn showing the vertical long-run
neoclassical aggregate supply curve. A decrease in aggregate
demand—for example, because of a decline in consumer confidence that
leads to less consumption and more saving—causes the original
aggregate demand curve AD<span class="s60">0</span> to shift back to
AD<span class="s60">1</span>. The shift from the original
equilibrium (E<span class="s60">0</span>) to the new equilibrium
(E<span class="s60">1</span>) results in a decline in output. The
economy is now below full employment and there is a surplus of
labor. As output falls below potential GDP, unemployment rises.
While a lower price level (i.e., deflation) is rare in the United
States, it does happen occasionally during very weak periods of
economic activity. For practical purposes, we might consider a lower
price level in the AD–AS model as indicative of disinflation, which
is a decline in the inflation rate. Thus, the long-run aggregate
supply curve LRASn, which is</p>
<p>vertical at the level of potential GDP, ultimately determines this
economy’s real GDP.</p>

<p><span id="bookmark1032"><span class="s36">Figure 13.5 A Rebound Back
to Potential GDP from a Shift to the Left in Aggregate Demand
</span></span>The original equilibrium (E<span
class="s63">0</span>), at an output level of 500 and a price level
of 120, happens at the intersection of the aggregate demand curve
(AD<span class="s63">0</span>) and the short-run aggregate supply
curve (SRAS<span class="s63">0</span>). The output at E<span
class="s63">0</span> is equal to potential GDP. Aggregate demand
shifts left, from AD<span class="s63">0</span> to AD<span
class="s63">1</span>. The new equilibrium is at E<span
class="s63">1</span>, with a lower output level of 450 and downward
pressure on the price level of 115. With high unemployment rates,
wages are held down. Lower wages are an economy-wide decrease in the
price of a key input, which shifts short-run aggregate supply to the
right, from SRAS<span class="s63">0</span> to SRAS<span
class="s63">1</span>. The new equilibrium (E<span
class="s63">2</span>) is at the same original level of output, 500,
but at a lower price level of 110.</p>
<p>Again, from the neoclassical perspective, this short-run scenario is
only the beginning of the chain of events. The higher level of
unemployment means more workers looking for jobs. As a result,
employers can hold down on pay increases—or perhaps even replace
some of their higher-paid workers with unemployed people willing to
accept a lower wage. As wages stagnate or fall, this decline in the
price of a key input means that the short-run Keynesian aggregate
supply curve shifts to the right from its original (SRAS<span
class="s60">0</span> to SRAS<span class="s60">1</span>). The overall
impact in the long run, as the macroeconomic equilibrium shifts from
E<span class="s60">0</span> to E<span class="s60">1</span> to E<span
class="s60">2</span>, is that the level of output returns to
potential GDP, where it started. There is, however, downward
pressure on the price level. Thus, in the neoclassical view, changes
in aggregate demand can have a short-run impact on output and on
unemployment—but only a short-run impact. In the long run, when
wages and prices are flexible, potential GDP and aggregate supply
determine real GDP’s size.</p>
<p>How Fast Is the Speed of Macroeconomic Adjustment?</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1033">How long does it take for wages and prices
to adjust, and for the economy to rebound to its potential GDP? This
subject is highly contentious. Keynesian economists argue that if
the adjustment from recession to potential GDP takes a very long
time, then neoclassical theory may be more hypothetical than
practical. In response to John Maynard Keynes’ immortal words, “In
the long run we are all dead,” neoclassical economists respond that
even if the adjustment takes as long as, say, ten years the
neoclassical perspective remains of central importance in
understanding the economy.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark1034">One subset of neoclassical economists holds
that wage and price adjustment in the macroeconomy might be quite
rapid. The theory of</span> <strong>rational expectations</strong> holds that
people form the most accurate possible expectations about the future
that they can, using all information available to them. In an
economy where most people have rational expectations, economic
adjustments may happen very quickly.</p>
<p>To understand how rational expectations may affect the speed of
price adjustments, think about a situation in the real estate
market. Imagine that several events seem likely to push up home
values in the neighborhood. Perhaps a local employer announces that
it plans to hire many more people or the city announces that it will
build a local park or a library in that neighborhood. The theory of
rational expectations points out that even though none of the
changes will happen immediately, home prices in the neighborhood
will rise immediately, because the expectation that homes will be
worth more in the future will lead buyers to be willing to pay more
in the present. The amount of the immediate increase in home prices
will depend on how likely it seems that the announcements about the
future will actually</p>
<p>happen and on how distant the local jobs and neighborhood
improvements are in the future. The key point is that, because of
rational expectations, prices do not wait on events, but adjust
immediately.</p>
<p>At a macroeconomic level, the theory of rational expectations points
out that if the aggregate supply curve is vertical over time, then
people should rationally expect this pattern. When a shift in
aggregate demand occurs, people and businesses with rational
expectations will know that its impact on output and employment will
be temporary, while its impact on the price level will be permanent.
If firms and workers perceive the outcome of the process in advance,
and if all firms and workers know that everyone else is perceiving
the process in the same way, then they have no incentive to go
through an extended series of short-run scenarios, like a firm first
hiring more people when aggregate demand shifts out and then firing
those same people when aggregate supply shifts back. Instead,
everyone will recognize where this process is heading—toward a
change in the price level—and then will act on that expectation. In
this scenario, the expected long-run change in the price level may
happen very quickly, without a drawn-out zigzag of output and
employment first moving one way and then the other.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1035">The theory that people and firms have
rational expectations can be a useful simplification, but as a
statement about how people and businesses actually behave, the
assumption seems too strong. After all, many people and firms are
not especially well informed, either about what is happening in the
economy or about how the economy works. An alternate assumption is
that people and firms act with</span> <strong>adaptive expectations</strong>:
they look at past experience and gradually adapt their beliefs and
behavior as circumstances change, but are not perfect synthesizers
of information and accurate predictors of the future in the sense of
rational expectations theory. If most people and businesses have
some form of adaptive expectations, then the adjustment from the
short run and long run will be traced out in incremental steps that
occur over time.</p>
<p>The empirical evidence on the speed of macroeconomic adjustment of
prices and wages is not clear-cut. The speed of macroeconomic
adjustment probably varies among different countries and time
periods. A reasonable guess is that the initial short-run effect of
a shift in aggregate demand might last two to five years, before the
adjustments in wages and prices cause the economy to adjust back to
potential GDP. Thus, one might think of the short run for applying
Keynesian analysis as time periods less than two to five years, and
the long run for applying neoclassical analysis as longer than five
years. For practical purposes, this guideline is frustratingly
imprecise, but when analyzing a complex social mechanism like an
economy as it evolves over time, some imprecision seems unavoidable.</p>

Policy Implications of the Neoclassical Perspective</span><span

<p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>

<li><p>Identify clear distinctions between neoclassical economics and
Keynesian economics</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To understand the policy recommendations of the neoclassical
economists, it helps to start with the Keynesian perspective.
Suppose a decrease in aggregate demand causes the economy to go into
recession with high unemployment. The Keynesian response would be to
use government policy to stimulate aggregate demand and eliminate
the recessionary gap. The neoclassical economists believe that the
Keynesian response, while perhaps well intentioned, will not have a
good outcome for reasons we will discuss shortly. Since the
neoclassical economists believe that the economy will correct itself
over time, the only advantage of a Keynesian stabilization policy
would be to accelerate the process and minimize the time that the
unemployed are out of work. Is that the likely outcome?</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1037">Keynesian macroeconomic policy requires some
optimism about the government’s ability to recognize a situation of
too little or too much aggregate demand, and to adjust aggregate
demand accordingly with the right level of changes in taxes or
spending, all enacted in a timely fashion. After all, neoclassical
economists argue, it takes government statisticians months to
produce even preliminary estimates of GDP so that politicians know
whether a recession is occurring—and those preliminary estimates may
be revised substantially later. Moreover, there is the question of
timely action. The political process can take more months to enact a
tax cut or a spending increase. Political or economic considerations
may determine the amount of tax or spending changes. Then the
economy will take still</span></p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_282.png" width="624" height="481" alt="image" />
<p>more months to put into effect changes in aggregate demand through
spending and production. When economists and policy makers consider
all of these time lags and political realities, active fiscal policy
may fail to address the current problem, and could even make the
future economy worse. The average U.S. post-World War II recession
has lasted only about a year. By the time government policy
activates, the recession will likely be over. As a consequence, the
only result of government fine-tuning will be to stimulate the
economy when it is already recovering (or to contract the economy
when it is already falling). In other words, an active macroeconomic
policy is likely to exacerbate the cycles rather than dampen them.
Some neoclassical economists believe a large part of the business
cycles we observe are due to flawed government policy. To learn
about this issue further, read the following Clear It Up feature.</p>
<p>Why and how do economists measure inflation expectations?</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1038">People take expectations about inflation
into consideration every time they make a major purchase, such as a
house or a car. As inflation fluctuates, so too does the nominal
interest rate on loans to buy these goods. The nominal interest rate
is comprised of the real rate, plus an</span> <strong>expected inflation</strong>
factor. Expected inflation also tells economists about how the
public views the economy’s direction. Suppose the public expects
inflation to increase. This could be the result of positive demand
shock due to an expanding economy and increasing aggregate demand.
It could also be the result of a negative supply shock, perhaps from
rising energy prices, and decreasing aggregate supply. In either
case, the public may expect the central bank to engage in
contractionary monetary policy to reduce inflation, and this policy
results in higher interest rates. If, however economists expect
inflation to decrease, the public may anticipate a recession. In
turn, the public may expect expansionary monetary policy, and lower
interest rates, in the short run. By monitoring expected inflation,
economists garner information about the effectiveness of
macroeconomic policies. Additionally, monitoring expected inflation
allows for projecting the direction of real interest rates that
isolate for the effect of inflation. This information is necessary
for making decisions about financing investments.</p>
<p>Expectations about inflation may seem like a highly theoretical
concept, but, in fact the Federal Reserve Bank measures, inflation
expectations based upon early research conducted by Joseph
Livingston, a financial journalist for the <em>Philadelphia Inquirer</em>.
In 1946, he started a twice-a-year survey of economists about their
expectations of inflation. After Livingston’s death in 1969, the
Federal Reserve Bank and other economic research agencies such as
the Survey Research Center at the University of Michigan, the
American Statistical Association, and the National Bureau of
Economic Research continued the survey.</p>

<p>The Neoclassical Phillips Curve Tradeoff</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark952" id="bookmark1039" class="a">The Keynesian Perspective</a>
<a href="#bookmark1040" class="s34">introduced the Phillips curve and explained how it is derived from the aggregate supply curve. The short run upward sloping aggregate supply curve implies a downward sloping Phillips curve; thus, there is a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment in the short run. By contrast, a neoclassical long-run aggregate supply curve will imply a vertical shape for the Phillips curve, indicating no long run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment.</a>
<a href="#bookmark1040" class="a">Figure 13.6</a>
<a href="#bookmark1040" class="s34">(a) shows the vertical AS curve, with three different levels of aggregate demand, resulting in three different equilibria, at three different price levels. At every point along that vertical AS curve, potential GDP and the rate of unemployment remains the same. Assume that for this economy, the natural rate of unemployment is 5%. As a result, the long-run Phillips curve relationship, in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1040" class="a">Figure 13.6</a> <span

Because output is unchanged between the equilibria E<span

<p><a href="#bookmark1042" class="s84">Step 1. Plot the data points in a graph with inflation rate on the vertical axis and unemployment rate on the horizontal axis. Your graph will appear similar to</a>
<a href="#bookmark1042" class="s43">Figure</a> 13.7<span
class="s37">.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark1042">Figure 13.7 Inflation Rates</span></p>
<p>Step 2. What patterns do you see in the data? You should notice that
there are years when unemployment falls but inflation rises, and
other years where unemployment rises and inflation falls.</p>
<p>Step 3. Can you determine the natural rate of unemployment from the
data or from the graph? As you analyze the graph, it appears that
the natural rate of unemployment lies at 4%. This is the rate that
the economy appears to adjust back to after an apparent change in
the economy. For example, in 1975 the economy appeared to have an
increase in aggregate demand. The unemployment rate fell to 3% but
inflation increased from 2% to 3%. By 1980, the economy had adjusted
back to 4% unemployment and the inflation rate had returned to 2%.
In 1985, the economy looks to have suffered a recession as
unemployment rose to 6% and inflation fell to 1%. This would be
consistent with a decrease in aggregate demand. By 1990, the economy
recovered back to 4% unemployment, but at a lower inflation rate of
1%. In 1995 the economy again rebounded and unemployment fell to 2%,
but inflation increased to 4%, which is consistent with a large
increase in aggregate demand. The economy adjusted back to 4%
unemployment but at a higher rate of inflation of 5%. Then in 2000,
both unemployment and inflation increased to 5% and 4%,
respectively.</p>

<p>Step 4. Do you see the Phillips curve(s) in the data? If we trace
the downward sloping trend of data points, we could see a short-run
Phillips curve that exhibits the inverse tradeoff between higher
unemployment and lower inflation rates. If we trace the vertical
line of data points, we could see a long-run Phillips curve at the
4% natural rate of unemployment.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1043">The unemployment rate on the long-run
Phillips curve will be the natural rate of unemployment. A small
inflationary increase in the price level from AD</span><span
class="s60">0</span> to AD<span class="s60">1</span> will have the
same natural rate of unemployment as a larger inflationary increase
in the price level from AD<span class="s60">0</span> to AD<span
class="s60">2</span>. The macroeconomic equilibrium along the
vertical aggregate supply curve can occur at a variety of different
price levels, and the natural rate of unemployment can be consistent
with all different rates of inflation. The great economist Milton
Friedman (1912–2006) summed up the neoclassical view of the
long-term Phillips curve tradeoff in a 1967 speech: “[T]here is
always a temporary trade-off between inflation and unemployment;
there is no permanent trade-off.”</p>

<p>In the Keynesian perspective, the primary focus is on getting the
level of aggregate demand right in relationship to an upward-sloping
aggregate supply curve. That is, the government should adjust AD so
that the economy produces at its potential GDP, not so low that
cyclical unemployment results and not so high that inflation
results. In the neoclassical perspective, aggregate supply will
determine output at potential GDP, the natural rate of unemployment
determines unemployment, and shifts in aggregate demand are the
primary determinant of changes in the price level.</p>
<p>Fighting Unemployment or Inflation?</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark619" id="bookmark1044" class="s34">As we explained in</a>
Unemployment<span class="p">, economists divide unemployment into
two categories: cyclical unemployment and the natural rate of
unemployment, which is the sum of frictional and structural
unemployment. Cyclical unemployment results from fluctuations in the
business cycle and is created when the economy is producing below
potential GDP—giving potential employers less incentive to hire.
When the economy is producing at potential GDP, cyclical
unemployment will be zero. Because of labor market dynamics, in
which people are always entering or exiting the labor force, the
unemployment rate never falls to 0%, not even when the economy is
producing at or even slightly above potential GDP. Probably the best
we can hope for is for the number of job vacancies to equal the
number of job seekers. We know that it takes time for job seekers
and employers to find each other, and this time is the cause of
frictional unemployment. Most economists do not consider frictional
unemployment to be a “bad” thing. After all, there will always be
workers who are unemployed while looking for a job that is a better
match for their skills. There will always be employers that have an
open position, while looking for a worker that is a better match for
the job. Ideally, these matches happen quickly, but even when the
economy is very strong there will be some natural unemployment and
this is what the natural rate of unemployment measures.</span><span
id="bookmark1045">‌</span></p>
<p>The neoclassical view of unemployment tends to focus attention away
from the cyclical unemployment problem—that is, unemployment caused
by recession—while putting more attention on the unemployment rate
issue that prevails even when the economy is operating at potential
GDP. To put it another way, the neoclassical view of unemployment
tends to focus on how the government can adjust public policy to
reduce the natural rate of unemployment. Such policy changes might
involve redesigning unemployment and welfare programs so that they</p>
<p>support those in need, but also offer greater encouragement for
job-hunting. It might involve redesigning business rules with an eye
to whether they are unintentionally discouraging businesses from
taking on new employees. It might involve building institutions to
improve the flow of information about jobs and the mobility of
workers, to help bring workers and employers together more quickly.
For those workers who find that their skills are permanently no
longer in demand (for example, the structurally unemployed),
economists can design policy to provide opportunities for retraining
so that these workers can reenter the labor force and seek
employment.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1046">Neoclassical economists will not tend to see
aggregate demand as a useful tool for reducing unemployment; after
all, with a vertical aggregate supply curve determining economic
output, then aggregate demand has no long-run effect on
unemployment. Instead, neoclassical economists believe that
aggregate demand should be allowed to expand only to match the
gradual shifts of aggregate supply to the right—keeping the price
level much the same and inflationary pressures low.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1048" id="bookmark1047" class="s34">If aggregate demand rises rapidly in the neoclassical model, in the long run it leads only to inflationary pressures.</a>

<p>Fighting Recession or Encouraging Long-Term Growth?</p>
<p>Neoclassical economists believe that the economy will rebound out of
a recession or eventually contract during an expansion because
prices and wage rates are flexible and will adjust either upward or
downward to restore the economy to its potential GDP. Thus, the key
policy question for neoclassicals is how to promote growth of
potential GDP. We know that economic growth ultimately depends on
the growth rate of long-term productivity. Productivity measures how
effective inputs are at producing outputs. We know that U.S.
productivity has grown on average about 2% per year. That means that
the same amount of inputs produce 2% more output than the year
before. We also know that productivity growth varies a great deal in
the short term due to cyclical factors. It also varies somewhat in
the long term. From 1953–1972, U.S. labor productivity (as measured
by output per hour in the business sector) grew at 3.2% per year.
From 1973–1992, productivity growth declined significantly to 1.8%
per year. Then, from 1993–2014, productivity growth increased
slightly to 2% per year. The neoclassical economists believe the
underpinnings of long- run productivity growth to be an economy’s
investments in human capital, physical capital, and technology,
operating together in a market-oriented environment that rewards
innovation. Government policy should focus on promoting these
factors.</p>
<p>Summary of Neoclassical Macroeconomic Policy Recommendations</p>
<p>Let’s summarize what neoclassical economists recommend for
macroeconomic policy. Neoclassical economists do not believe in
“fine-tuning” the economy. They believe that a stable economic
environment with a low rate of inflation fosters economic growth.
Similarly, tax rates should be low and unchanging. In this
environment, private economic agents can make the best possible
investment decisions, which will lead to optimal investment in
physical and human capital as well as research and development to
promote improvements in technology.</p>

style=" color: #3767B1;">Balancing Keynesian and Neoclassical
Models</span><span id="bookmark1050">‌</span></p>
<p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Evaluate how neoclassical economists and Keynesian economists
react to recessions</p></li>
<li><p>Analyze the interrelationship between the neoclassical and
Keynesian economic models</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We can compare finding the balance between Keynesian and
Neoclassical models to the challenge of riding two horses
simultaneously. When a circus performer stands on two horses, with a
foot on each one, much of the excitement for the viewer lies in
contemplating the gap between the two. As modern macroeconomists
ride into the future on two horses—with one foot on the short-term
Keynesian perspective and one foot on the long-term neoclassical
perspective—the balancing act may look uncomfortable, but there does
not seem to be any way to avoid it. Each approach, Keynesian and
neoclassical, has its strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1051">The short-term Keynesian model, built on the
importance of aggregate demand as a cause of business cycles and a
degree of wage and price rigidity, does a sound job of explaining
many recessions and why cyclical unemployment rises and falls. By
focusing on the short-run aggregate demand adjustments, Keynesian
economics risks overlooking the long-term causes of economic growth
or the natural rate of unemployment that exist even when the economy
is producing at potential GDP.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark1052">The neoclassical model, with its emphasis on
aggregate supply, focuses on the underlying determinants of output
and employment in markets, and thus tends to put more emphasis on
economic growth and how labor markets work. However, the
neoclassical view is not especially helpful in explaining why
unemployment moves up and down over short time horizons of a few
years. Nor is the neoclassical model especially helpful when the
economy is mired in an especially deep and long-lasting recession,
like the 1930s Great Depression. Keynesian economics tends to view
inflation as a price that might sometimes be paid for lower
unemployment; neoclassical economics tends to view inflation as a
cost that offers no offsetting gains in terms of lower
unemployment.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark1053">Macroeconomics cannot, however, be summed up
as an argument between one group of economists who are pure
Keynesians and another group who are pure neoclassicists. Instead,
many mainstream economists believe both the Keynesian and
neoclassical perspectives. Robert Solow, the Nobel laureate in
economics in 1987, described the dual approach in this way:</span></p>
<p>At short time scales, I think, something sort of ‘Keynesian’ is a
good approximation, and surely better than anything straight
‘neoclassical.’ At very long time scales, the interesting questions
are best studied in a neoclassical framework, and attention to the
Keynesian side of things would be a minor distraction. At the
five-to-ten-year time scale, we have to piece things together as
best we can, and look for a hybrid model that will do the job.</p>
<p>Many modern macroeconomists spend considerable time and energy
trying to construct models that blend the most attractive aspects of
the Keynesian and neoclassical approaches. It is possible to
construct a somewhat complex</p>

<p>Were the policies that the government implemented to stabilize the
economy and financial markets during the Great Recession effective?
Many economists from both the Keynesian and neoclassical schools
have found that they were, although to varying degrees. Alan Blinder
of Princeton University and Mark Zandi for Moody’s Analytics found
that, without fiscal policy, GDP decline would have been
significantly more than its 3.3% in 2008 followed by its 0.1%
decline in 2009. They also estimated that there would have been</p>
<p>8.5 million more job losses had the government not intervened in the
market with the TARP to support the financial industry and key
automakers General Motors and Chrysler. Federal Reserve Bank
economists Carlos Carvalho, Stefano Eusip, and Christian Grisse
found in their study, <em>Policy Initiatives in the Global Recession:
What Did Forecasters Expect?</em> that once the government implemented
policies, forecasters adapted their expectations to these policies.
They were more likely to anticipate increases in investment due to
lower interest rates brought on by monetary policy and increased
economic growth resulting from fiscal policy.</p>
<p>The difficulty with evaluating the effectiveness of the
stabilization policies that the government took in response to the
Great Recession is that we will never know what would have happened
had the government not implemented those policies. Surely some of
the programs were more effective at creating and saving jobs, while
other programs were less so. The final conclusion on the
effectiveness of macroeconomic policies is still up for debate, and
further study will no doubt consider the impact of these policies on
the U.S. budget and deficit, as well as the U.S. dollar’s value in
the financial market.</p>

prices matter in the short run, but wages, prices, and aggregate
supply adjust in the long run. However, creating an overall model
that encompasses both short-term Keynesian and long-term
neoclassical models is not easy.</p>

<p>KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY</p>
<ol>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark1020" class="a">The Building Blocks of Neoclassical</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark1020">Analysis</a></p>
<p>The neoclassical perspective argues that, in the long run, the
economy will adjust back to its potential GDP level of output
through flexible price levels. Thus, the neoclassical
perspective views the long-run AS curve as vertical. A rational
expectations perspective argues that people have excellent
information about economic events and how the economy works and
that, as a result, price and other economic adjustments will
happen very quickly. In adaptive expectations theory, people
have limited information about economic information and how the
economy works, and so price and other economic adjustments can
be slow.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark1036" class="a">The Policy Implications of the Neoclassical</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark1036">Perspective</a></p>
<p>Neoclassical economists tend to put relatively more emphasis on
long-term growth than on fighting recession, because they
believe that recessions will fade in a few years and long-term
growth will ultimately determine the standard of living. They
tend to focus more on reducing the natural rate of unemployment
caused by economic institutions and government policies than the
cyclical unemployment caused by recession.</p>
<p>Neoclassical economists also see no social benefit to inflation.
With an upward-sloping Keynesian AS curve, inflation can arise
because an economy is approaching full employment. With a
vertical long-run neoclassical AS curve, inflation does not
accompany any rise in output. If aggregate supply is vertical,
then aggregate demand does not affect the quantity of output.
Instead, aggregate demand can only cause inflationary changes in
the price level. A vertical aggregate supply curve, where the
quantity of output is consistent with many different price
levels, also implies a vertical Phillips curve.</p>

<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark1050">Models</a></p></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Keynesian perspective considers changes to aggregate demand to be
the cause of business cycle fluctuations. Keynesians are likely to
advocate that policy makers actively attempt to reverse recessionary and
inflationary periods because they are not convinced that the
self-correcting economy can easily return to full employment.</p>
<p>The neoclassical perspective places more emphasis on aggregate supply.
Neoclassical economists believe that long term productivity growth
determines the potential GDP level and that the economy typically will
return to full employment after a change in aggregate demand. Skeptical
of the effectiveness and timeliness of Keynesian policy, neoclassical
economists are more likely to advocate a hands-off, or fairly limited,
role for active stabilization policy.</p>
<p>While Keynesians would tend to advocate an acceptable tradeoff between
inflation and unemployment when counteracting a recession, neoclassical
economists argue that no such tradeoff exists. Any short-term gains in
lower unemployment will eventually vanish and the result of active
policy will only be inflation.</p>

<p>The Many Disguises of Money: From Cowries to Bitcoins</p>
<p>Here is a trivia question: In the history of the world, what item did
people use for money over the broadest geographic area and for the
longest period of time? The answer is not gold, silver, or any precious
metal. It is the cowrie, a mollusk shell found mainly off the Maldives
Islands in the Indian Ocean. Cowries served as money as early as 700
B.C. in China. By the 1500s, they were in widespread use across India
and Africa. For several centuries after that, cowries were the means for
exchange in markets including southern Europe, western Africa, India,
and China: everything from buying lunch or a ferry ride to paying for a
shipload of silk or rice. Cowries were still acceptable as a way of
paying taxes in certain African nations in the early twentieth century.</p>
<p>What made cowries work so well as money? First, they are extremely
durable—lasting a century or more. As the late economic historian Karl
Polyani put it, they can be “poured, sacked, shoveled, hoarded in heaps”
while remaining “clean, dainty, stainless, polished, and milk-white.”
Second, parties could use cowries either by counting shells of a certain
size, or—for large purchases—by measuring the weight or volume of the
total shells they would exchange. Third, it was impossible to
counterfeit a cowrie shell, but dishonest people could counterfeit gold
or silver coins by making copies with cheaper metals. Finally, in the
heyday of cowrie money, from the 1500s into the 1800s, governments,
first the Portuguese, then the Dutch and English, tightly controlled
collecting cowries. As a result, the supply of cowries grew quickly
enough to serve the needs of</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Explain the various functions of money</p></li>
<li><p>Contrast commodity money and fiat money</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Money for the sake of money is not an end in itself. You cannot eat
dollar bills or wear your bank account. Ultimately, the usefulness
of money rests in exchanging it for goods or services. As the
American writer and humorist Ambrose Bierce (1842–1914) wrote in
1911, money is a “blessing that is of no advantage to us excepting
when we part with it.” Money is what people regularly use when
purchasing or selling goods and services, and thus both buyers and
sellers must widely accept money. This concept of money is
intentionally flexible, because money has taken a wide variety of
forms in different cultures.</p>
<p>Barter and the Double Coincidence of Wants</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1076">To understand the usefulness of money, we
must consider what the world would be like without money. How would
people exchange goods and services? Economies without money
typically engage in the barter system.</span> <strong>Barter</strong>—literally
trading one good or service for another—is highly inefficient for
trying to coordinate the trades in a modern advanced economy. In an
economy without money, an exchange between two people would involve
a <strong>double coincidence of wants</strong>, a situation in which two people
each want some good or service that the other person can provide.
For example, if an accountant wants a pair of shoes, this accountant
must find someone who has a pair of shoes in the correct size and
who is willing to exchange the shoes for some hours of accounting
services. Such a trade is likely to be difficult to arrange. Think
about the complexity of such trades in a modern economy, with its
extensive division of labor that involves thousands upon thousands
of different jobs and goods.<span id="bookmark1077">‌</span></p>
<p>Another problem with the barter system is that it does not allow us
to easily enter into future contracts for purchasing many goods and
services. For example, if the goods are perishable it may be
difficult to exchange them for other goods in the future. Imagine a
farmer wanting to buy a tractor in six months using a fresh crop of
strawberries. Additionally, while the barter system might work
adequately in small economies, it will keep these economies from</p>
<p>growing. The time that individuals would otherwise spend producing
goods and services and enjoying leisure time they spend bartering.</p>
<p>Functions for Money</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1078">Money solves the problems that the barter
system creates. (We will get to its definition soon.) First, money
serves as a</span> <strong>medium of exchange</strong>, which means that money
acts as an intermediary between the buyer and the seller. Instead of
exchanging accounting services for shoes, the accountant now
exchanges accounting services for money. The accountant then uses
this money to buy shoes. To serve as a medium of exchange, people
must widely accept money as a method of payment in the markets for
goods, labor, and financial capital.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1079">Second, money must serve as a</span> <strong>store
of value</strong>. In a barter system, we saw the example of the shoemaker
trading shoes for accounting services. However, she risks having her
shoes go out of style, especially if she keeps them in a warehouse
for future use—their value will decrease with each season. Shoes are
not a good store of value. Holding money is a much easier way of
storing value. You know that you do not need to spend it immediately
because it will still hold its value the next day, or the next year.
This function of money does not require that money is a <em>perfect</em>
store of value. In an economy with inflation, money loses some
buying power each year, but it remains money.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1080">Third, money serves as a</span> <strong>unit of
account</strong>, which means that it is the ruler by which we measure
values. For example, an accountant may charge <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(100 to file your tax
return. That \)</span>100 can purchase two pair of shoes at $50 a pair.
Money acts as a common denominator, an accounting method that
simplifies thinking about trade-offs.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1081">Finally, another function of money is that
it must serve as a</span> <strong>standard of deferred payment</strong>. This
means that if money is usable today to make purchases, it must also
be acceptable to make purchases today that the purchaser will pay in
the <em>future</em>. Loans and future agreements are stated in monetary
terms and the standard of deferred payment is what allows us to buy
goods and services today and pay in the future. Thus, <strong>money</strong>
serves all of these functions— it is a medium of exchange, store of
value, unit of account, and standard of deferred payment.<span
id="bookmark1082">‌</span></p>
<p>Commodity versus Fiat Money</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1083">Money has taken a wide variety of forms in
different cultures. People have used gold, silver, cowrie shells,
cigarettes, and even cocoa beans as money. Although we use these
items as</span> <strong>commodity money</strong>, they also have a value from use
as something other than money. For example, people have used gold
throughout the ages as money although today we do not use it as
money but rather value it for its other attributes. Gold is a good
conductor of electricity and the electronics and aerospace industry
use it. Other industries use gold too, such as to manufacture energy
efficient reflective glass for skyscrapers and is used in the
medical industry as well. Of course, gold also has value because of
its beauty and malleability in creating jewelry.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1084">As commodity money, gold has historically
served its purpose as a medium of exchange, a store of value, and as
a unit of account.</span> <strong>Commodity-backed currencies</strong>
<a href="#bookmark1085" class="s34">are dollar bills or other currencies with values backed up by gold or other commodities held at a bank. During much of its history, gold and silver backed the money supply in the United States. Interestingly, antique dollars dated as late as 1957, have “Silver Certificate” printed over the portrait of George Washington, as</a>
<a href="#bookmark1085" class="a">Figure 14.2</a><span class="s54">
</span>shows. This meant that the holder could take the bill to the
appropriate bank and exchange it for a dollar’s worth of silver.</p>

<p><span id="bookmark1086">As economies grew and became more global in
nature, the use of commodity monies became more cumbersome.
Countries moved towards the use of</span> <strong>fiat money</strong>. Fiat money
has no intrinsic value, but is declared by a government to be a
country’s legal tender. The United States’ paper money, for example,
carries the statement: “THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER FOR ALL DEBTS,
PUBLIC AND PRIVATE.” In other words, by government decree, if you
owe a debt, then legally speaking, you can pay that debt with the
U.S. currency, even though it is not backed by a commodity. The only
backing of our money is universal faith and trust that the currency
has value, and nothing more.</p>

<p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Contrast M1 money supply and M2 money supply</p></li>
<li><p>Classify monies as M1 money supply or M2 money supply</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span id="bookmark1088">Cash in your pocket certainly serves as
money; however, what about checks or credit cards? Are they money,
too? Rather than trying to state a single way of measuring money,
economists offer broader definitions of money based on liquidity.
Liquidity refers to how quickly you can use a financial asset to buy
a good or service. For example, cash is very liquid. You can use
your <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10 bill easily to buy a hamburger at lunchtime. However, \)</span>10
that you have in your</span></p>
<p>savings account is not so easy to use. You must go to the bank or
ATM machine and withdraw that cash to buy your lunch. Thus, $10 in
your savings account is <em>less</em> liquid.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1089">The Federal Reserve Bank, which is the
central bank of the United States, is a bank regulator and is
responsible for monetary policy and defines money according to its
liquidity. There are two definitions of money: M1 and M2 money
supply.</span> <strong>M1 money supply</strong> includes those monies that are
very liquid such as cash, checkable (demand) deposits, and
traveler’s checks <strong>M2 money supply</strong> is less liquid in nature and
includes M1 plus savings and time deposits, certificates of
deposits, and money market funds.<span
id="bookmark1090">‌</span><span id="bookmark1091">‌</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark1092">M1 money supply includes</span> <strong>coins and
currency in circulation</strong>—the coins and bills that circulate in an
economy that the U.S. Treasury does not hold at the Federal Reserve
Bank, or in bank vaults. Closely related to currency are checkable
deposits, also known as <strong>demand deposits</strong>. These are the amounts
held in checking accounts. They are called demand deposits or
checkable deposits because the banking institution must give the
deposit holder his money “on demand” when the customer writes a
check or uses a debit card. These items together—currency, and
checking accounts in banks—comprise the definition of money known as
M1, which the Federal Reserve System measures daily.<span
id="bookmark1093">‌</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark1094">A broader definition of money, M2 includes
everything in M1 but also adds other types of deposits. For example,
M2 includes</span> <strong>savings deposits</strong> in banks, which are bank
accounts on which you cannot write a check directly, but from which
you can easily withdraw the money at an automatic teller machine or
bank. Many banks and other financial institutions also offer a
chance to invest in <strong>money market funds</strong>, where they pool together
the deposits of many individual investors and invest them in a safe
way, such as short-term government bonds. Another ingredient of M2
are the relatively small (that is, less than about $100,000)
certificates of deposit (CDs) or <strong>time
deposits</strong><a href="#bookmark1097" class="s34">, which are accounts that the depositor has committed to leaving in the bank for a certain period of time, ranging from a few months to a few years, in exchange for a higher interest rate. In short, all these types of M2 are money that you can withdraw and spend, but which require a greater effort to do so than the items in M1.</a>
<a href="#bookmark1097" class="a">Figure 14.3</a><span class="s54">
</span>should help in visualizing the relationship between M1 and
M2. Note that M1 is included in the M2 calculation.<span

<p><span id="bookmark1097">Figure 14.3 The Relationship between M1 and
M2 Money</span> <span class="s37">M1 and M2 money have several
definitions, ranging from narrow to broad. M1 = coins and currency
in circulation + checkable (demand) deposit + traveler’s checks. M2
= M1 + savings deposits + money market funds + certificates of
deposit + other time deposits.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1098" class="s34">The Federal Reserve System is responsible for tracking the amounts of M1 and M2 and prepares a weekly release of information about the money supply. To provide an idea of what these amounts sound like, according to the Federal Reserve Bank’s measure of the U.S. money stock, at the end of February 2015, M1 in the United States was <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3 trillion, while M2 was \)</span>11.8 trillion.</a>

<p>Table 14.1 M1 and M2 Federal Reserve Statistical Release, Money
Stock Measures
<a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/RELEASES/h6/current/default.htm#t2tg1link)" class="s48">(Source: Federal Reserve Statistical Release, http://www.federalreserve.gov/RELEASES/h6/current/default.htm#t2tg1link)</a></p>
<p>The lines separating M1 and M2 can become a little blurry. Sometimes
businesses do not treat elements of M1 alike. For example, some
businesses will not accept personal checks for large amounts, but
will accept traveler’s checks or cash. Changes in banking practices
and technology have made the savings accounts in M2 more similar to
the checking accounts in M1. For example, some savings accounts will
allow depositors to write checks, use automatic teller machines, and
pay bills over the internet, which has made it easier to access
savings accounts. As with many other economic terms and statistics,
the important point is to know the strengths and limitations of the
various definitions of money, not to believe that such definitions
are as clear-cut to economists as, say, the definition of nitrogen
is to chemists.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1099">Where does “plastic money” like debit cards,
credit cards, and smart money fit into this picture? A</span>
<strong>debit card</strong>, like a check, is an instruction to the user’s bank
to transfer money directly and immediately from your bank account to
the seller. It is important to note that in our definition of money,
it is <em>checkable deposits</em> that are money, not the paper check or
the debit card. Although you can make a purchase with a <strong>credit
card</strong>, the financial institution does not consider it money but
rather a short term loan from the credit card company to you. When
you make a credit card purchase, the credit card company immediately
transfers money from its checking account to the seller, and at the
end of the month, the credit card company sends you a bill for what
you have charged that month. Until you pay the credit card bill, you
have effectively borrowed money from the credit card company. With a
<strong>smart card</strong>, you can store a certain value of money on the card
and then use the card to make purchases. Some “smart cards” used for
specific purposes, like long-distance phone calls or making
purchases at a campus bookstore and cafeteria, are not really all
that smart, because you can only use them for certain purchases or
in certain places.<span id="bookmark1100">‌</span><span
id="bookmark1101">‌</span></p>
<p>In short, credit cards, debit cards, and smart cards are different
ways to move money when you make a purchase. However, having more
credit cards or debit cards does not change the quantity of money in
the economy, any more than printing more checks increases the amount
of money in your checking account.</p>
<p>One key message underlying this discussion of M1 and M2 is that
money in a modern economy is not just paper bills and coins.
Instead, money is closely linked to bank accounts. The banking
system largely conducts macroeconomic policies concerning money. The
next section explains how banks function and how a nation’s banking
system has the power to create money.</p>

</ul>
<p>Somebody once asked the late bank robber named Willie Sutton why he
robbed banks. He answered: “That’s where the money is.” While this
may have been true at one time, from the perspective of modern
economists, Sutton is both right and wrong. He is wrong because the
overwhelming majority of money in the economy is not in the form of
currency sitting in vaults or drawers at banks, waiting for a robber
to appear. Most money is in the form of bank accounts, which exist
only as electronic records on computers. From a broader perspective,
however, the bank robber was more right than he may have known.
Banking is intimately interconnected with money and consequently,
with the broader economy.</p>
<p>Banks make it far easier for a complex economy to carry out the
extraordinary range of transactions that occur in goods, labor, and
financial capital markets. Imagine for a moment what the economy
would be like if everybody had to make all payments in cash. When
shopping for a large purchase or going on vacation you might need to
carry hundreds of dollars in a pocket or purse. Even small
businesses would need stockpiles of cash to pay workers and to
purchase supplies. A bank allows people and businesses to store this
money in either a checking account or savings account, for example,
and then withdraw this money as needed through the use of a direct
withdrawal, writing a check, or using a debit card.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1103">Banks are a critical intermediary in what we
call the</span> <strong>payment system</strong>, which helps an economy exchange
goods and services for money or other financial assets. Also, those
with extra money that they would like to save can store their money
in a bank rather than look for an individual who is willing to
borrow it from them and then repay them at a later date. Those who
want to borrow money can go directly to a bank rather than trying to
find someone to lend them cash. <strong>Transaction costs</strong> are the costs
associated with finding a lender or a borrower for this money. Thus,
banks lower transactions costs and act as financial
intermediaries—they bring savers and borrowers together. Along with
making transactions much safer and easier, banks also play a key
role in creating money.<span id="bookmark1104">‌</span></p>
<p>Banks as Financial Intermediaries</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1105">An “intermediary” is one who stands between
two other parties. Banks are a</span> <strong>financial
intermediary</strong>—that is, an institution that operates between a saver
who deposits money in a bank and a borrower who receives a loan from
that bank. Financial intermediaries include other institutions in
the financial market such as insurance companies and pension funds,
but we will not include them in this discussion because they are not
<strong>depository institutions</strong>, which are institutions that accept
money <em>deposits</em>
<a href="#bookmark1107" class="s34">and then use these to make loans. All the deposited funds mingle in one big pool, which the financial institution then lends.</a>
<a href="#bookmark1107" class="a">Figure 14.4</a><span class="s54">
</span>illustrates the position of banks as financial
intermediaries, with deposits flowing into a bank and loans flowing
out. Of course, when banks make loans to firms, the banks will try
to funnel financial capital to healthy businesses that have good
prospects for repaying the loans, not<span
id="bookmark1106">‌</span></p>
<p>to firms that are suffering losses and may be unable to repay.</p>

<p><span id="bookmark1107">Figure 14.4 Banks as Financial
Intermediaries</span> <span class="s37">Banks act as financial
intermediaries because they stand between savers and borrowers.
Savers place deposits with banks, and then receive interest payments
and withdraw money. Borrowers receive loans from banks and repay the
loans with interest. In turn, banks return money to savers in the
form of withdrawals, which also include interest payments from banks
to savers.</span></p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_299.png" width="624" height="51" alt="image" />
<p>How are banks, savings and loans, and credit unions related?</p>
<p>Banks have a couple of close cousins: savings institutions and
credit unions. Banks, as we explained, receive deposits from
individuals and businesses and make loans with the money. Savings
institutions are also sometimes called “savings and loans” or
“thrifts.” They also take loans and make deposits. However, from the
1930s until the 1980s, federal law limited how much interest savings
institutions were allowed to pay to depositors. They were also
required to make most of their loans in the form of housing-related
loans, either to homebuyers or to real-estate developers and
builders.</p>
<p>A credit union is a nonprofit financial institution that its members
own and run. Members of each credit union decide who is eligible to
be a member. Usually, potential members would be everyone in a
certain community, or groups of employees, or members of a certain
organization. The credit union accepts deposits from members and
focuses on making loans back to its members. While there are more
credit unions than banks and more banks than savings and loans, the
total assets of credit unions are growing.</p>
<p>In 2008, there were 7,085 banks. Due to the bank failures of
2007–2009 and bank mergers, there were 5,571 banks in the United
States at the end of the fourth quarter in 2014. According to the
Credit Union National Association, as of December 2014 there were
6,535 credit unions with assets totaling <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1.1 billion. A day of
“Transfer Your Money” took place in 2009 out of general public
disgust with big bank bailouts. People were encouraged to transfer
their deposits to credit unions. This has grown into the ongoing
Move Your Money Project. Consequently, some now hold deposits as
large as \)</span>50 billion. However, as of 2013, the 12 largest banks
(0.2%) controlled 69 percent of all banking assets, according to the
Dallas Federal Reserve.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1108">A Bank’s Balance Sheet</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark1109">A</span> <strong>balance sheet</strong> is an accounting
tool that lists assets and liabilities. An <strong>asset</strong> is something of
value that you own and you can use to produce something. For
example, you can use the cash you own to pay your tuition. If you
own a home, this is also an asset. A <strong>liability</strong> is a debt or
something you owe. Many people borrow money to buy homes. In this
case, a home is the asset, but the mortgage is the liability. The
<strong>net worth</strong> is the asset value minus how much is owed (the
liability). A bank’s balance sheet operates in much the same way. A
bank’s net worth as <strong>bank capital</strong>. We also refer to a bank has
assets such as cash held in its vaults, monies that the bank holds
at the Federal Reserve bank<span id="bookmark1110">‌</span><span
id="bookmark1111">‌</span><span id="bookmark1112">‌</span></p>
<p>(called “reserves”), loans that it makes to customers, and bonds.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1114" id="bookmark1113" class="a">Figure 14.5</a><span
class="s54"> </span>illustrates a hypothetical and simplified
balance sheet for the Safe and Secure Bank. Because of the two-
column format of the balance sheet, with the T-shape formed by the
vertical line down the middle and the horizontal line under “Assets”
and “Liabilities,” we sometimes call it a <strong>T-account</strong>.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_300.jpg" width="606" height="67" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark1114">Figure 14.5 A Balance Sheet for the Safe and
Secure Bank</span></p>
<p>The “T” in a T-account separates the assets of a firm, on the left,
from its liabilities, on the right. All firms use T- accounts,
though most are much more complex. For a bank, the assets are the
financial instruments that either the bank is holding (its reserves)
or those instruments where other parties owe money to the bank—like
loans made by the bank and U.S. Government Securities, such as U.S.
treasury bonds purchased by the bank. Liabilities are what the bank
owes to others. Specifically, the bank owes any deposits made in the
bank to those who have made them. The net worth of the bank is the
total assets minus total liabilities. Net worth is included on the
liabilities side to have the T account balance to zero. For a
healthy business, net worth will be positive. For a bankrupt firm,
net worth will be negative. In either case, on a bank’s T-account,
assets will always equal liabilities plus net worth.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1114" class="s34">When bank customers deposit money into a checking account, savings account, or a certificate of deposit, the bank views these deposits as liabilities. After all, the bank owes these deposits to its customers, when the customers wish to withdraw their money. In the example in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1114" class="a">Figure</a> 14.5<span class="p">,
the Safe and Secure Bank holds $10 million in deposits.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1114" id="bookmark1115" class="s34">Loans are the first category of bank assets in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1114" class="a">Figure</a> 14.5<span class="p">.
Say that a family takes out a 30-year mortgage loan to purchase a
house, which means that the borrower will repay the loan over the
next 30 years. This loan is clearly an asset from the bank’s
perspective, because the borrower has a legal obligation to make
payments to the bank over time. However, in practical terms, how can
we measure the value of the mortgage loan that the borrower is
paying over 30 years in the present? One way of measuring the value
of something—whether a loan or anything else—is by estimating what
another party in the market is willing to pay for it. Many banks
issue home loans, and charge various handling and processing fees
for doing so, but then sell the loans to other banks or financial
institutions who collect the loan payments. We call the market where
financial institutions make loans to borrowers the primary loan
market, while the market in which financial institutions buy and
sell these loans is the secondary loan market.</span></p>
<p>One key factor that affects what financial institutions are willing
to pay for a loan, when they buy it in the secondary loan market, is
the perceived riskiness of the loan: that is, given the borrower’s
characteristics, such as income level and whether the local economy
is performing strongly, what proportion of loans of this type will
the borrower repay? The greater the risk that a borrower will not
repay loan, the less that any financial institution will pay to
acquire the loan. Another key factor is to compare the interest rate
the financial institution charged on the original loan with the
current interest rate in the economy. If the original loan requires
the borrower to pay a low interest rate, but current interest rates
are relatively high, then a financial institution will pay less to
acquire the loan. In contrast, if the original loan requires the
borrower to pay a high interest rate, while current interest rates
are relatively low, then a financial institution will pay more to
acquire the loan. For the Safe and Secure Bank in this example, the
total value of its loans if they sold them to other financial
institutions in the secondary market is $5 million.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1116">The second category of bank asset is bonds,
which are a common mechanism for borrowing, used by the federal and
local government, and also private companies, and nonprofit
organizations. A bank takes some of the money it has received in
deposits and uses the money to buy bonds—typically bonds issued that
the U.S. government issues. Government bonds are low-risk because
the government is virtually certain to pay off the bond, albeit at a
low rate of interest. These bonds are an asset for banks in the same
way that loans are an asset: The bank will receive a stream of
payments in the future. In our example, the Safe and Secure Bank
holds bonds worth a total value of $4 million.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark1117">The final entry under assets is</span>
<strong>reserves</strong><a href="#bookmark1177" class="s34">, which is money that the bank keeps on hand, and that it does not lend or invest in bonds—and thus does not lead to interest payments. The Federal Reserve requires that banks keep a certain percentage of depositors’ money on “reserve,” which means either in their vaults or at the Federal Reserve Bank. We call this a reserve requirement. (</a><a href="#bookmark1177" class="a">Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation</a><span
class="s54"> </span>will explain how the level of these required
reserves are one policy tool that governments have to influence bank
behavior.) Additionally, banks may also want to keep a certain
amount of reserves on hand in excess of what is required. The Safe
and Secure Bank is holding</p>
<p>$2 million in reserves.</p>

<p>How Banks Go Bankrupt</p>
<p>A bank that is bankrupt will have a negative net worth, meaning its
assets will be worth less than its liabilities. How can this happen?
Again, looking at the balance sheet helps to explain.</p>

<p>What led to the 2008–2009 financial crisis?</p>
<p>Many banks make mortgage loans so that people can buy a home, but
then do not keep the loans on their books as an asset. Instead, the
bank sells the loan. These loans are “securitized,” which means that
they are bundled together into a financial security that a financial
institution sells to investors. Investors in these mortgage-backed
securities receive a rate of return based on the level of payments
that people make on all the mortgages that stand behind the
security.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1118">Securitization offers certain advantages. If
a bank makes most of its loans in a local area, then the bank may be
financially vulnerable if the local economy declines, so that many
people are unable to make their payments. However, if a bank sells
its local loans, and then buys a mortgage-backed security based on
home loans in many parts of the country, it can avoid exposure to
local financial risks. (In the simple example in the text, banks
just own “bonds.” In reality, banks can own a number of financial
instruments, as long as these financial investments are safe enough
to satisfy the government bank regulators.) From the standpoint of a
local homebuyer, securitization offers the benefit that a local bank
does not need to have significant extra funds to make a loan,
because the bank is only planning to hold that loan for a short
time, before selling the loan so that it can pool it into a
financial security.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1114" class="s34">A well-run bank will assume that a small percentage of borrowers will not repay their loans on time, or at all, and factor these missing payments into its planning. Remember, the calculations of the banks’ expenses every year include a factor for loans that borrowers do not repay, and the value of a bank’s loans on its balance sheet assumes a certain level of riskiness because some customers will not repay loans. Even if a bank expects a certain number of loan defaults, it will suffer if the number of loan defaults is much greater than expected, as can happen during a recession. For example, if the Safe and Secure Bank in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1114" class="a">Figure 14.5</a> <span
class="p">experienced a wave of unexpected defaults, so that its
loans declined in value from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(5 million to \)</span>3 million, then the
assets of the Safe and Secure Bank would decline so that the bank
had negative net worth.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark1119">However, securitization also offers one
potentially large disadvantage. If a bank plans to hold a mortgage
loan as an asset, the bank has an incentive to scrutinize the
borrower carefully to ensure that the customer is likely to repay
the loan. However, a bank that plans to sell the loan may be less
careful in making the loan in the first place. The bank will be more
willing to make what we call “subprime loans,” which are loans that
have characteristics like low or zero down-payment, little scrutiny
of whether the borrower has a reliable income, and sometimes low
payments for the first year or two that will be followed by much
higher payments. Economists dubbed some financial institutions that
made subprime loans in the mid-2000s NINJA loans: loans that
financial institutions made even though the borrower had
demonstrated No Income, No Job, or Assets.</span></p>
<p>Financial institutions typically sold these subprime loans and
turned them into financial securities—but with a twist. The idea was
that if losses occurred on these mortgage-backed securities, certain
investors would agree to take the first, say, 5% of such losses.
Other investors would agree to take, say, the next 5% of losses. By
this approach, still other investors would not need to take any
losses unless these mortgage-backed financial securities lost 25% or
30% or more of their total value. These complex securities, along
with other economic factors, encouraged a large expansion of
subprime loans in the mid-2000s.</p>
<p>The economic stage was now set for a banking crisis. Banks thought
they were buying only ultra-safe securities, because even though the
securities were ultimately backed by risky subprime mortgages, the
banks only invested in the part of those securities where they were
protected from small or moderate levels of losses. However, as
housing prices fell after 2007, and the deepening recession made it
harder for many people to make their mortgage payments, many banks
found that their mortgage-backed financial assets could be worth
much less than they had expected—and so the banks were faced with
staring bankruptcy. In the 2008–2011 period, 318 banks failed in the
United States.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1120">The risk of an unexpectedly high level of
loan defaults can be especially difficult for banks because a bank’s
liabilities, namely it customers’ deposits. Customers can withdraw
funds quickly but many of the bank’s assets like loans and bonds
will only be repaid over years or even decades. This</span>
<strong>asset-liability time mismatch</strong>—the ability for customers to
withdraw bank’s liabilities in the short term while customers repay
its assets in the long term—can cause severe problems for a bank.
For example, imagine a bank that has loaned a substantial amount of
money at a certain interest rate, but then sees interest rates rise
substantially. The bank can find itself in a precarious situation.
If it does not raise the interest rate it pays to depositors, then
deposits will flow to other institutions that offer the higher
interest rates that are now prevailing. However, if the bank raises
the interest rates that it pays to depositors, it may end up in a
situation where it is paying a higher interest rate to depositors
than it is collecting from those past loans that it at lower
interest rates. Clearly, the bank cannot survive in the long term if
it is paying out more in interest to depositors than it is receiving
from borrowers.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1121">How can banks protect themselves against an
unexpectedly high rate of loan defaults and against the risk of an
asset-liability time mismatch? One strategy is for a bank to</span>
<strong>diversify</strong> its loans, which means lending to a variety of
customers. For example, suppose a bank specialized in lending to a
niche market—say, making a high proportion of its loans to
construction companies that build offices in one downtown area. If
that one area suffers an unexpected economic downturn, the bank will
suffer large losses. However, if a bank loans both to consumers who
are buying homes and cars and also to a wide range of firms in many
industries and geographic areas, the bank is less exposed to risk.
When a bank diversifies its loans, those categories of borrowers who
have an unexpectedly large number of defaults will tend to be
balanced out, according to random chance, by other borrowers who
have an unexpectedly low number of defaults. Thus, diversification
of loans can help banks to keep a positive net worth. However, if a
widespread recession occurs that touches many industries and
geographic areas, diversification will not help.</p>
<p>Along with diversifying their loans, banks have several other
strategies to reduce the risk of an unexpectedly large number of
loan defaults. For example, banks can sell some of the loans they
make in the secondary loan market, as we described earlier, and
instead hold a greater share of assets in the form of government
bonds or reserves. Nevertheless, in a lengthy recession, most banks
will see their net worth decline because customers will not repay a
higher share of loans in tough economic times.</p>

Banks Create Money</span><span id="bookmark1122">‌</span></p>
<p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Utilize the money multiplier formulate to determine how banks
create money</p></li>
<li><p>Analyze and create T-account balance sheets</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate the risks and benefits of money and banks</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Banks and money are intertwined. It is not just that most money is
in the form of bank accounts. The banking system can literally
create money through the process of making loans. Let’s see how.</p>
<p>Money Creation by a Single Bank</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1123" class="s34">Start with a hypothetical bank called Singleton Bank. The bank has $10 million in deposits. The T-account balance sheet for Singleton Bank, when it holds all of the deposits in its vaults, is in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1123" class="a">Figure</a> 14.6<span class="p">.
At this stage, Singleton Bank is simply storing money for depositors
and is using these deposits to make loans. In this simplified
example, Singleton Bank cannot earn any interest income from these
loans and cannot pay its depositors an interest rate either.</span></p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_303.jpg" width="606" height="45" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark1123">Figure 14.6 Singleton Bank’s Balance Sheet:
Receives $10 million in Deposits</span></p>
<p>The Federal Reserve requires Singleton Bank to keep <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1 million on
reserve (10% of total deposits). It will loan out the remaining \)</span>9
million. By loaning out the $9 million and charging interest, it
will be able to make interest payments to depositors and earn
interest income for Singleton Bank (for now, we will keep it simple
and not put interest income on the balance sheet). Instead of
becoming just a storage place for deposits, Singleton Bank can
become a financial intermediary between savers and borrowers.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1124" class="s34">This change in business plan alters Singleton Bank’s balance sheet, as</a>
<a href="#bookmark1124" class="a">Figure 14.7</a> <span
class="p">shows. Singleton’s assets have changed. It now has <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1
million in reserves and a loan to Hank’s Auto Supply of \)</span>9 million.
The bank still has $10 million in deposits.</span></p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_304.jpg" width="606" height="54" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark1124">Figure 14.7 Singleton Bank’s Balance Sheet:
10% Reserves, One Round of Loans</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1125" class="s34">Singleton Bank lends <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(9 million to Hank’s Auto Supply. The bank records this loan by making an entry on the balance sheet to indicate that it has made a loan. This loan is an asset, because it will generate interest income for the bank. Of course, the loan officer will not allow let Hank to walk out of the bank with \)</span>9 million in cash. The bank issues Hank’s Auto Supply a cashier’s check for the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(9 million. Hank deposits the loan in his regular checking account with First National. The deposits at First National rise by \)</span>9 million and its reserves also rise by $9 million, as</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark1125">Figure</a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1125" class="a">14.8</a> <span class="p">shows.
First National must hold 10% of additional deposits as required
reserves but is free to loan out the rest</span></p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_305.jpg" width="606" height="45" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark1125">Figure 14.8 First National Balance
Sheet</span></p>
<p>Making loans that are deposited into a demand deposit account
increases the M1 money supply. Remember the definition of M1
includes checkable (demand) deposits, which one can easily use as a
medium of exchange to buy goods and services. Notice that the money
supply is now <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(19 million: \)</span>10 million in deposits in Singleton bank
and</p>
<p>$9 million in deposits at First National. Obviously as Hank’s Auto
Supply writes checks to pay its bills the deposits will draw down.
However, the bigger picture is that a bank must hold enough money in
reserves to meet its liabilities.</p>
<p>The rest the bank loans out. In this example so far, bank lending
has expanded the money supply by $9 million.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1126" class="s34">Now, First National must hold only 10% as required reserves (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(900,000) but can lend out the other 90% (\)</span>8.1 million) in a loan to Jack’s Chevy Dealership as</a>

<span style=" color: #000;">to learn more about how banks create
money.</span></p>
<p>How is this money creation possible? It is possible because there
are multiple banks in the financial system, they are required to
hold only a fraction of their deposits, and loans end up deposited
in other banks, which increases deposits and, in essence, the money
supply.</p>
<p>The Money Multiplier and a Multi-Bank System</p>
<p>In a system with multiple banks, Singleton Bank deposited the
initial excess reserve amount that it decided to lend to Hank’s Auto
Supply into First National Bank, which is free to loan out $8.1
million. If all banks loan out their excess reserves, the money
supply will expand. In a multi-bank system, institutions determine
the amount of money that the system can create by using the money
multiplier. This tells us by how many times a loan will be
“multiplied” as it is spent in the economy and then re-deposited in
other banks.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1128">Fortunately, a formula exists for
calculating the total of these many rounds of lending in a banking
system. The</span> <strong>money multiplier formula</strong> is:</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Reserve Requirement</p>
<p>We then multiply the money multiplier by the change in excess
reserves to determine the total amount of M1 money supply created in
the banking system. See the Work it Out feature to walk through the
multiplier calculation.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_309.png" width="624" height="319" alt="image" />
<p>= <u>    1</u><span class="s73"> </span>× $9 million</p>
<p>0.10</p>
<p>= 10 × $9 million</p>
<p>= $90 million</p>
<p>Step 3. Thus, we can say that, in this example, the total quantity
of money generated in this economy after all rounds of lending are
completed will be $90 million.</p>
<p>Reserve Requirement</p>
<p>Total Change in the M1 Money Supply = <u>                 1
              </u> <span class="s73"> </span>× Excess Requirement</p>
<p>Using the Money Multiplier Formula</p>
<p>Using the money multiplier for the example in this text:</p>
<p>Step 1. In the case of Singleton Bank, for whom the reserve
requirement is 10% (or 0.10), the money multiplier is 1 divided by
.10, which is equal to 10.</p>
<p>Step 2. We have identified that the excess reserves are $9 million,
so, using the formula we can determine the total change in the M1
money supply:</p>
<p>Cautions about the Money Multiplier</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1177" class="s34">The money multiplier will depend on the proportion of reserves that the Federal Reserve Band requires banks to hold. Additionally, a bank can also choose to hold extra reserves. Banks may decide to vary how much they hold in reserves for two reasons: macroeconomic conditions and government rules. When an economy is in recession, banks are likely to hold a higher proportion of reserves because they fear that customers are less likely to repay loans when the economy is slow. The Federal Reserve may also raise or lower the required reserves held by banks as a policy move to affect the quantity of money in an economy, as</a>
<a href="#bookmark1177" class="a">Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation</a>
<span class="p">will discuss.</span></p>
<p>The process of how banks create money shows how the quantity of
money in an economy is closely linked to the quantity of lending or
credit in the economy. All the money in the economy, except for the
original reserves, is a result of bank loans that institutions
repeatedly re-deposit and loan.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_310.png" width="624" height="220" alt="image" />
<p><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/moneymyth" class="s84">Watch a</a>
<a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/moneymyth" class="s41">video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/moneymyth)</a>
<span style=" color: #000;">of Jem Bendell discussing “The Money
Myth.”</span></p>
<p>Finally, the money multiplier depends on people re-depositing the
money that they receive in the banking system. If people instead
store their cash in safe-deposit boxes or in shoeboxes hidden in
their closets, then banks cannot recirculate the money in the form
of loans. Central banks have an incentive to assure that bank
deposits are safe because if people worry that they may lose their
bank deposits, they may start holding more money in cash, instead of
depositing it in banks, and the quantity of loans in an economy will
decline. Low-income countries have what economists sometimes refer
to as “mattress savings,” or money that people are hiding in their
homes because they do not trust banks. When mattress savings in an
economy are substantial, banks cannot lend out those funds and the
money multiplier cannot operate as effectively. The overall quantity
of money and loans in such an economy will decline.</p>
<p>Money and Banks—Benefits and Dangers</p>
<p>Money and banks are marvelous social inventions that help a modern
economy to function. Compared with the alternative of barter, money
makes market exchanges vastly easier in goods, labor, and financial
markets. Banking makes money still more effective in facilitating
exchanges in goods and labor markets. Moreover, the process of banks
making loans in financial capital markets is intimately tied to the
creation of money.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_311.png" width="624" height="46" alt="image" />
<p>The Many Disguises of Money: From Cowries to Bit Coins</p>
<p>The global economy has come a long way since it started using cowrie
shells as currency. We have moved away from commodity and
commodity-backed paper money to fiat currency. As technology and
global integration increases, the need for paper currency is
diminishing, too. Every day, we witness the increased use of debit
and credit cards.</p>
<p>The latest creation and perhaps one of the purest forms of fiat
money is the Bitcoin. Bitcoins are a digital currency that allows
users to buy goods and services online. Customers can purchase
products and services such as videos and books using Bitcoins. This
currency is not backed by any commodity nor has any government
decreed as legal tender, yet customers use it as a medium of
exchange and can store its value (online at least). It is also
unregulated by any central bank, but is created online through
people solving very complicated mathematics problems and receiving
payment afterward. <a class="reference external" href="http://Bitcoin.org">Bitcoin.org</a> is an information source if you are
curious. Bitcoins are a relatively new type of money. At present,
because it is not sanctioned as a legal currency by any country nor
regulated by any central bank, it lends itself for use in illegal as
well as legal trading activities. As technology increases and the
need to reduce transactions costs associated with using traditional
forms of money increases, Bitcoins or some sort of digital currency
may replace our dollar bill, just as man replaced the cowrie shell.</p>
<p>However, the extraordinary economic gains that are possible through
money and banking also suggest some possible corresponding dangers.
If banks are not working well, it sets off a decline in convenience
and safety of transactions throughout the economy. If the banks are
under financial stress, because of a widespread decline in the value
of their assets, loans may become far less available, which can deal
a crushing blow to sectors of the economy that depend on borrowed
money like business investment, home construction, and car
manufacturing. The 2008–2009 Great Recession illustrated this
pattern.</p>

<p>KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY</p>
<ol>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark1075" class="a">Defining Money by Its</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark1075">Functions</a></p>
<p>Money is what people in a society regularly use when purchasing
or selling goods and services. If money were not available,
people would need to barter with each other, meaning that each
person would need to identify others with whom they have a
double coincidence of wants—that is, each party has a specific
good or service that the other desires. Money serves several
functions: a medium of exchange, a unit of account, a store of
value, and a standard of deferred payment. There are two types
of money: commodity money, which is an item used as money, but
which also has value from its use as something other than money;
and fiat money, which has no intrinsic value, but is declared by
a government to be the country’s legal tender.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark1087" class="a">Measuring Money: Currency, M1, and</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark1087">M2</a></p>
<p>We measure money with several definitions: M1 includes currency
and money in checking accounts (demand deposits). Traveler’s
checks are also a component of M1, but are declining in use. M2
includes all of M1, plus savings deposits, time deposits like
certificates of deposit, and money market funds.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark1102" class="a">The Role of</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark1102">Banks</a></p>
<p>Banks facilitate using money for transactions in the economy
because people and firms can use bank accounts when selling or
buying goods and services, when paying a worker or receiving
payment, and when saving money or receiving a loan. In the
financial capital market, banks are financial intermediaries;
that is, they operate between savers who supply financial
capital and borrowers who demand loans. A balance sheet
(sometimes called a T-account) is an accounting tool which lists
assets in one column and liabilities in another. The bank’s
liabilities are its deposits. The bank’s assets include its
loans, its ownership of bonds, and its reserves (which it does
not loan out). We calculate a bank’s net worth by subtracting
its liabilities from its assets. Banks run a risk of negative
net worth if the value of their assets declines. The value of
assets can decline because of an unexpectedly high number of
defaults on loans, or if interest rates rise and the bank
suffers an asset-liability time mismatch in which the bank is
receiving a low interest rate on its long-term loans but must
pay the currently higher market interest rate to attract
depositors. Banks</p>
<p>can protect themselves against these risks by choosing to
diversify their loans or to hold a greater proportion of their
assets in bonds and reserves. If banks hold only a fraction of
their deposits as reserves, then the process of banks’ lending
money, re-depositing those loans in banks, and the banks making
additional loans will create money in the economy.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark1122" class="a">How Banks Create</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark1122">Money</a></p></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We define the money multiplier as the quantity of money that the banking
system can generate from each $1 of bank reserves. The formula for
calculating the multiplier is 1/reserve ratio, where the reserve ratio
is the fraction of deposits that the bank wishes to hold as reserves.
The quantity of money in an economy and the quantity of credit for loans
are inextricably intertwined. The network of banks making loans, people
making deposits, and banks making more loans creates much of the money
in an economy.</p>

<p>The Problem of the Zero Percent Interest Rate Lower Bound</p>
<p>Most economists believe that monetary policy (the manipulation of
interest rates and credit conditions by a nation’s central bank) has a
powerful influence on a nation’s economy. Monetary policy works when the
central bank reduces interest rates and makes credit more available. As
a result, business investment and other types of spending increase,
causing GDP and employment to grow.</p>
<p>However, what if the interest rates banks pay are close to zero already?
They cannot be made negative, can they? That would mean that lenders pay
borrowers for the privilege of taking their money. Yet, this was the
situation the U.S. Federal Reserve found itself in at the end of the
2008–2009 recession. The federal funds rate, which is the interest rate
for banks that the Federal Reserve targets with its monetary policy, was
slightly above 5% in 2007. By 2009, it had fallen to 0.16%.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve’s situation was further complicated because fiscal
policy, the other major tool for managing the economy, was constrained
by fears that the federal budget deficit and the public debt were
already too high. What were the Federal Reserve’s options? How could the
Federal Reserve use monetary policy to stimulate the economy? The
answer, as we will see in this chapter, was to change the rules of the
game.</p>

</ul>
<p>Money, loans, and banks are all interconnected. Money is deposited in
bank accounts, which is then loaned to businesses, individuals, and
other banks. When the interlocking system of money, loans, and banks
works well, economic transactions smoothly occur in goods and labor
markets and savers are connected with borrowers. If the money and
banking system does not operate smoothly, the economy can either fall
into recession or suffer prolonged inflation.</p>
<p>The government of every country has public policies that support the
system of money, loans, and banking. However, these policies do not
always work perfectly. This chapter discusses how monetary policy works
and what may prevent it from working perfectly.</p>

</ul>
<p><span id="bookmark1179">In making decisions about the money supply,
a central bank decides whether to raise or lower interest rates and,
in this way, to influence macroeconomic policy, whose goal is low
unemployment and low inflation. The central bank is also responsible
for regulating all or part of the nation’s banking system to protect
bank depositors and insure the health of the bank’s balance
sheet.</span><span id="bookmark1180">‌</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark1181">We call the organization responsible for
conducting monetary policy and ensuring that a nation’s financial
system operates smoothly the</span> <strong>central bank</strong>. Most nations
have central banks or currency boards. Some prominent central banks
around the world include the European Central Bank, the Bank of
Japan, and the Bank of England. In the United States, we call the
central bank the Federal Reserve—often abbreviated as just “the
Fed.” This section explains the U.S. Federal Reserve’s organization
and identifies the major central bank’s responsibilities.<span
id="bookmark1182">‌</span><span id="bookmark1183">‌</span></p>
<p>Structure/Organization of the Federal Reserve</p>
<p>Unlike most central banks, the Federal Reserve is
semi-decentralized, mixing government appointees with representation
from private-sector banks. At the national level, it is run by a
Board of Governors, consisting of seven members appointed by the
President of the United States and confirmed by the Senate.
Appointments are for 14-year terms and they are arranged so that one
term expires January 31 of every even-numbered year. The purpose of
the long and staggered terms is to insulate the Board of Governors
as much as possible from political pressure so that governors can
make policy decisions based only on their economic merits.
Additionally, except when filling an unfinished term, each member
only serves one term, further insulating decision-making from
politics. The Fed’s policy decisions do not require congressional
approval, and the President cannot ask for a Federal Reserve
Governor to resign as the President can with cabinet positions.</p>
<p>One member of the Board of Governors is designated as the Chair. For
example, from 1987 until early 2006, the Chair was Alan Greenspan.
From 2006 until 2014, Ben Bernanke held the post. The current Chair,
Janet Yellen, has made</p>

<p>many headlines already. Why? See the following Clear It Up feature

<p>Who has the most immediate economic power in the world?</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1184">Figure 15.2 Chair of the Federal Reserve
Board</span> <span class="s37">Janet L. Yellen is the first woman to

Governors. (Credit: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System)</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1184" id="bookmark1185" class="s84">What individual can make financial market crash or soar just by making a public statement? It is not Bill Gates or Warren Buffett. It is not even the President of the United States. The answer is the Chair of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. In early 2014, Janet L. Yellen, (</a><a href="#bookmark1184" class="s43">Figure</a>
15.2<span class="s37">) became the first woman to hold this post.
The media had described Yellen as “perhaps the most qualified Fed
chair in history.” With a Ph.D. in economics from Yale University,
Yellen has taught macroeconomics at Harvard, the London School of
Economics, and most recently at the University of California at
Berkeley. From 2004–2010, Yellen was President of the Federal
Reserve Bank of San Francisco. Not an ivory tower economist, Yellen
became one of the few economists who warned about a possible bubble
in the housing market, more than two years before the financial
crisis occurred. Yellen served on the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve twice, most recently as Vice Chair. She also spent
two years as Chair of the President’s Council of Economic Advisors.
If experience and credentials mean anything, Yellen is likely to be
an effective Fed chair.</span></p>

<p>The Fed Chair is first among equals on the Board of Governors. While
he or she has only one vote, the Chair controls the agenda, and is
the Fed’s public voice, so he or she has more power and influence
than one might expect.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1186" class="s34">The Federal Reserve is more than the Board of Governors. The Fed also includes 12 regional Federal Reserve banks, each of which is responsible for supporting the commercial banks and economy generally in its district.</a>
<a href="#bookmark1186" class="a">Figure</a> 15.3 <span
class="p">shows the Federal Reserve districts and the cities where
their regional headquarters are located. The commercial banks in
each district elect a Board of Directors for each regional Federal
Reserve bank, and that board chooses a president for each regional
Federal Reserve district. Thus, the Federal Reserve System includes
both federally and private-sector appointed leaders.</span></p>

Districts</span> <span class="s37">There are twelve regional Federal
Reserve banks, each with its district.</span></p>
<p>What Does a Central Bank Do?</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve, like most central banks, is designed to perform
three important functions:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>To conduct monetary policy</p></li>
<li><p>To promote stability of the financial system</p></li>
<li><p>To provide banking services to commercial banks and other
depository institutions, and to provide banking services to the
federal government.</p>
<p>The first two functions are sufficiently important that we will
discuss them in their own modules. The third function we will
discuss here.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve provides many of the same services to banks
as banks provide to their customers. For example, all commercial
banks have an account at the Fed where they deposit reserves.
Similarly, banks can obtain loans from the Fed through the
“discount window” facility, which we will discuss in more detail
later. The Fed is also responsible for check processing. When
you write a check, for example, to buy groceries, the grocery
store deposits the check in its bank account. Then, the grocery
store’s bank returns the physical check (or an image of that
actual check) to your bank, after which it transfers funds from
your bank account to the grocery store’s account. The Fed is
responsible for each of these actions.</p>
<p>On a more mundane level, the Federal Reserve ensures that enough
currency and coins are circulating through the financial system
to meet public demands. For example, each year the Fed increases
the amount of currency available in banks around the Christmas
shopping season and reduces it again in January.</p>
<p>Finally, the Fed is responsible for assuring that banks are in
compliance with a wide variety of consumer protection laws. For
example, banks are forbidden from discriminating on the basis of
age, race, sex, or marital status. Banks are also required to
disclose publicly information about the loans they make for
buying houses and how they distribute</p>
<p>the loans geographically, as well as by sex and race of the loan
applicants.</p>

Regulation</span><span id="bookmark1187">‌</span></p>
<p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Discuss the relationship between bank regulation and monetary
policy</p></li>
<li><p>Explain bank supervision</p></li>
<li><p>Explain how deposit insurance and lender of last resort are two
strategies to protect against bank runs</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span id="bookmark1188">A safe and stable national financial system
is a critical concern of the Federal Reserve. The goal is not only
to protect individuals’ savings, but to protect the integrity of the
financial system itself. This esoteric task is usually behind the
scenes, but came into view during the 2008–2009 financial crisis,
when for a brief period of time, critical parts of the financial
system failed and firms became unable to obtain financing for
ordinary parts of their business. Imagine if suddenly you were
unable to access the money in your bank accounts because your checks
were not accepted for payment and your debit cards were declined.
This gives an idea of a failure of the payments/financial
system.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1071" id="bookmark1189" class="s34">Bank regulation is intended to maintain banks’ solvency by avoiding excessive risk. Regulation falls into a number of categories, including reserve requirements, capital requirements, and restrictions on the types of investments banks may make. In</a>
<a href="#bookmark1071" class="a">Money and</a> Banking<span
class="p">, we learned that banks are required to hold a minimum
percentage of their deposits on hand as reserves. “On hand” is a bit
of a misnomer because, while a portion of bank reserves are held as
cash in the bank, the majority are held in the bank’s account at the
Federal Reserve, and their purpose is to cover desired withdrawals
by depositors. Another part of bank regulation is restrictions on
the types of investments banks are allowed to make. Banks are
permitted to make loans to businesses, individuals, and other banks.
They can purchase U.S. Treasury securities but, to protect
depositors, they are not permitted to invest in the stock market or
other assets that are perceived as too risky.</span><span

style=" color: #000;">to read the brief article, “Stop Confusing
Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation.”</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark1191">Bank capital is the difference between a
bank’s assets and its liabilities. In other words, it is a bank’s
net worth. A bank must have positive net worth; otherwise it is
insolvent or bankrupt, meaning it would not have enough assets to
pay back its liabilities. Regulation requires that banks maintain a
minimum net worth, usually expressed as a percent of their assets,
to protect their depositors and other creditors.</span></p>
<p>Bank Supervision</p>
<p>Several government agencies monitor banks’ balance sheets to make
sure they have positive net worth and are not taking too high a
level of risk. Within the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has a national staff of
bank examiners who conduct on-site reviews of the 1,500 or so of the
largest national banks. The bank examiners also review any foreign
banks that have branches in the United States. The Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency also monitors and regulates about 800
savings and loan institutions.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1192">The National Credit Union Administration
(NCUA) supervises credit unions, which are nonprofit banks that
their</span></p>
<p>members run and own. There are over 6,000 credit unions in the U.S.
economy, although the typical credit union is small compared to most
banks.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve also has some responsibility for supervising
financial institutions. For example, we call conglomerate firms that
own banks and other businesses “bank holding companies.” While other
regulators like the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
supervises the banks, the Federal Reserve supervises the holding
companies.</p>
<p>When bank supervision (and bank-like institutions such as savings
and loans and credit unions) works well, most banks will remain
financially healthy most of the time. If the bank supervisors find
that a bank has low or negative net worth, or is making too high a
proportion of risky loans, they can require that the bank change its
behavior—or, in extreme cases, even force the bank to close or be
sold to a financially healthy bank.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1071" id="bookmark1193" class="s34">Bank supervision can run into both practical and political questions. The practical question is that measuring the value of a bank’s assets is not always straightforward. As we discussed in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1071" class="a">Money and</a> Banking<span
class="p">, a bank’s assets are its loans, and the value of these
assets depends on estimates about the risk that customers will not
repay these loans. These issues can become even more complex when a
bank makes loans to banks or firms in other countries, or arranges
financial deals that are much more complex than a basic loan.</span></p>
<p>The political question arises because a bank supervisor’s decision
to require a bank to close or to change its financial investments is
often controversial, and the bank supervisor often comes under
political pressure from the bank’s owners and the local politicians
to keep quiet and back off.</p>
<p>For example, many observers have pointed out that Japan’s banks were
in deep financial trouble through most of the 1990s; however,
nothing substantial had been done about it by the early 2000s. A
similar unwillingness to confront problems with struggling banks is
visible across the rest of the world, in East Asia, Latin America,
Eastern Europe, Russia, and elsewhere.</p>
<p>In the United States, the government passed laws in the 1990s
requiring that bank supervisors make their findings open and public,
and that they act as soon as they identify a problem. However, as
many U.S. banks were staggered by the 2008-2009 recession, critics
of the bank regulators asked pointed questions about why the
regulators had not foreseen the banks’ financial shakiness earlier,
before such large losses had a chance to accumulate.</p>
<p>Bank Runs</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1195" id="bookmark1194" class="s34">Back in the nineteenth century and during the first few decades of the twentieth century (around and during the Great Depression), putting your money in a bank could be nerve-wracking. Imagine that the net worth of your bank became negative, so that the bank’s assets were not enough to cover its liabilities. In this situation, whoever withdrew their deposits first received all of their money, and those who did not rush to the bank quickly enough, lost their money. We call depositors racing to the bank to withdraw their deposits, as</a>
<a href="#bookmark1195" class="a">Figure 15.4</a><span class="s54">
</span>shows a <strong>bank run</strong>. In the movie <em>It’s a Wonderful Life</em>,
the bank manager, played by Jimmy Stewart, faces a mob of worried
bank depositors who want to withdraw their money, but manages to
allay their fears by allowing some of them to withdraw a portion of
their deposits—using the money from his own pocket that was supposed
to pay for his honeymoon.</p>

class="s37">Bank runs during the Great Depression only served to
worsen the economic situation. (Credit: National Archives and
Records Administration)</span></p>
<p>The risk of bank runs created instability in the banking system.
Even a rumor that a bank might experience negative net worth could
trigger a bank run and, in a bank run, even healthy banks could be
destroyed. Because a bank loans out most of the money it receives,
and because it keeps only limited reserves on hand, a bank run of
any size would quickly drain any of the bank’s available cash. When
the bank had no cash remaining, it only intensified the fears of
remaining depositors that they could lose their money. Moreover, a
bank run at one bank often triggered a chain reaction of runs on
other banks. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century,
bank runs were typically not the original cause of a recession—but
they could make a recession much worse.</p>
<p>Deposit Insurance</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1196">To protect against bank runs, Congress has
put two strategies into place:</span> <strong>deposit insurance</strong> and the
lender of last resort. Deposit insurance is an insurance system that
makes sure depositors in a bank do not lose their money, even if the
bank goes bankrupt. About 70 countries around the world, including
all of the major economies, have deposit insurance programs. In the
United States, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is
responsible for deposit insurance. Banks pay an insurance premium to
the FDIC. The insurance premium is based on the bank’s level of
deposits, and then adjusted according to the riskiness of a bank’s
financial situation. In 2009, for example, a fairly safe bank with a
high net worth might have paid 10–20 cents in insurance premiums for
every <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(100 in bank deposits, while a risky bank with very low net
worth might have paid 50–60 cents for every \)</span>100 in bank
deposits.<span id="bookmark1197">‌</span></p>
<p>Bank examiners from the FDIC evaluate the banks’ balance sheets,
looking at the asset and liability values to determine the risk
level. The FDIC provides deposit insurance for about 5,898 banks (as
of the end of February 2017). Even if a bank fails, the government
guarantees that depositors will receive up to $250,000 of their
money in each account, which is enough for almost all individuals,
although not sufficient for many businesses. Since the United States
enacted deposit insurance in the 1930s, no one has lost any of their
insured deposits. Bank runs no longer happen at insured banks.</p>
<p>Lender of Last Resort</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1198">The problem with bank runs is not that
insolvent banks will fail; they are, after all, bankrupt and need to
be shut down. The problem is that bank runs can cause solvent banks
to fail and spread to the rest of the financial system. To prevent
this, the Fed stands ready to lend to banks and other financial
institutions when they cannot obtain funds from anywhere else. This
is known as the</span> <strong>lender of last resort</strong> role. For banks,
the central bank acting as a lender of last resort helps to
reinforce the effect of deposit insurance and to reassure bank
customers that they will not lose their money.</p>
<p>The lender of last resort task can arise in other financial crises,
as well. During the 1987 stock market crash panic, when U.S. stock
values fell by 25% in a single day, the Federal Reserve made a
number of short-term emergency loans so that the financial system
could keep functioning. During the 2008-2009 recession, we can
interpret the Fed’s “quantitative easing” policies (discussed below)
as a willingness to make short-term credit available as needed in a</p>
<p>time when the banking and financial system was under stress.</p>

<li><p>Evaluate reserve requirements and discount rates</p></li>
<li><p>Interpret and show bank activity through balance sheets</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span id="bookmark1200">The Federal Reserve’s most important
function is to conduct the nation’s monetary policy. Article I,
Section 8 of the</span></p>
<p>U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power “to coin money” and “to
regulate the value thereof.” As part of the 1913 legislation that
created the Federal Reserve, Congress delegated these powers to the
Fed. Monetary policy involves managing interest rates and credit
conditions, which influences the level of economic activity, as we
describe in more detail below.</p>
<p>A central bank has three traditional tools to implement monetary
policy in the economy:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Open market operations</p></li>
<li><p>Changing reserve requirements</p></li>
<li><p>Changing the discount rate</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In discussing how these three tools work, it is useful to think of
the central bank as a “bank for banks”—that is, each private-sector
bank has its own account at the central bank. We will discuss each
of these monetary policy tools in the sections below.</p>
<p>Open Market Operations</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1201">The most common monetary policy tool in the
U.S. is</span> <strong>open market operations</strong>.These take place when the
central bank sells or buys U.S. Treasury bonds in order to influence
the quantity of bank reserves and the level of interest rates. The
specific interest rate targeted in open market operations is the
federal funds rate. The name is a bit of a misnomer since the
federal funds rate is the interest rate that commercial banks charge
making overnight loans to other banks. As such, it is a very short
term interest rate, but one that reflects credit conditions in
financial markets very well.</p>

about current monetary policy.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark1202">The</span> <strong>Federal Open Market Committee
(FOMC)</strong> makes the decisions regarding these open market operations.
The FOMC comprises seven members of the Federal Reserve’s Board of
Governors. It also includes five voting members who the Board draws,
on a rotating basis, from the regional Federal Reserve Banks. The
New York district president is a permanent FOMC voting member and
the Board fills other four spots on a rotating, annual basis, from
the other 11 districts. The FOMC typically meets every six weeks,
but it can meet more frequently if necessary. The FOMC tries to act
by consensus; however, the Federal Reserve’s chairman has
traditionally played a very powerful role in defining and shaping
that consensus. For the Federal Reserve, and for most central banks,
open market operations have, over the last few decades, been the
most commonly used tool of monetary policy.</p>

<p><a href="#bookmark1203" class="s34">To understand how open market operations affect the money supply, consider the balance sheet of Happy Bank, displayed in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1203" class="a">Figure</a>

<a href="#bookmark1203" class="a">Figure 15.5</a>
<a href="#bookmark1203" class="s34">(a) shows that Happy Bank starts with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(460 million in assets, divided among reserves, bonds and loans, and \)</span>400 million in liabilities in the form of deposits, with a net worth of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(60 million.

<a href="#bookmark1203" class="s34">(b) shows. However, Happy Bank only wants to hold <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(40 million in reserves (the quantity of reserves with which it started in&lt;/a&gt;

<a href="#bookmark1203" class="a">Figure</a>
15.5<a href="#bookmark1071" class="s34">(c) shows. The central bank’s open market operation causes Happy Bank to make loans instead of holding its assets in the form of government bonds, which expands the money supply. As the new loans are deposited in banks throughout the economy, these banks will, in turn, loan out some of the deposits they receive, triggering the money multiplier that we discussed in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1071" class="a">Money and</a> Banking<span
class="p">.</span></p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_321.jpg" width="614" height="326" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark1203">Figure 15.5</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark1204">Where did the Federal Reserve get the $20
million that it used to purchase the bonds? A central bank has the
power to create money. In practical terms, the Federal Reserve would
write a check to Happy Bank, so that Happy Bank can have that money
credited to its bank account at the Federal Reserve. In truth, the
Federal Reserve created the money to purchase the bonds out of thin
air—or with a few clicks on some computer keys.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1205" class="s34">Open market operations can also reduce the quantity of money and loans in an economy.</a>
<a href="#bookmark1205" class="a">Figure 15.6</a> <span

central bank sells bonds in the open market. When Happy Bank

&lt;a href=&quot;#bookmark1205&quot; class=&quot;a&quot;&gt;Figure 15.6&lt;/a&gt;

<a href="#bookmark1205" class="a">Figure 15.6</a> <span
class="p">(a), so it will adjust down the quantity of its loans by
$30 million, to bring its reserves back to the</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1205" class="s34">desired level, as</a>
<a href="#bookmark1205" class="a">Figure 15.6</a>
<a href="#bookmark1071" class="s34">(c) shows. In practical terms, a bank can easily reduce its quantity of loans. At any given time, a bank is receiving payments on loans that it made previously and also making new loans. If the bank just slows down or briefly halts making new loans, and instead adds those funds to its reserves, then its overall quantity of loans will decrease. A decrease in the quantity of loans also means fewer deposits in other banks, and other banks reducing their lending as well, as the money multiplier that we discussed in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1071" class="a">Money and Banking</a> <span
class="p">takes effect. What about all those bonds? How do they
affect the money supply? Read the following Clear It Up feature for
the answer.</span></p>

<p><span id="bookmark1205">Figure 15.6</span></p>
<p>Does selling or buying bonds increase the money supply?</p>
<p>Is it a sale of bonds by the central bank which increases bank
reserves and lowers interest rates or is it a purchase of bonds by
the central bank? The easy way to keep track of this is to treat the
central bank as being <em>outside</em> the banking system. When a central
bank buys bonds, money is flowing from the central bank to
individual banks in the economy, increasing the money supply in
circulation. When a central bank sells bonds, then money from
individual banks in the economy is flowing into the central
bank—reducing the quantity of money in the economy.</p>
<p>Changing Reserve Requirements</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1206">A second method of conducting monetary
policy is for the central bank to raise or lower the</span>
<strong>reserve requirement</strong>, which, as we noted earlier, is the
percentage of each bank’s deposits that it is legally required to
hold either as cash in their vault or on deposit with the central
bank. If banks are required to hold a greater amount in reserves,
they have less money available to lend out. If banks are allowed to
hold a smaller amount in reserves, they will have a greater amount
of money available to lend out.<span id="bookmark1207">‌</span></p>
<p>In early 2015, the Federal Reserve required banks to hold reserves
equal to 0% of the first <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(14.5 million in deposits, then to hold
reserves equal to 3% of the deposits up to \)</span>103.6 million, and 10%
of any amount above <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(103.6 million. The Fed makes small changes in
the reserve requirements almost every year. For example, the \)</span>103.6
million dividing line is sometimes bumped up or down by a few
million dollars. In practice, the Fed rarely uses large changes in
reserve requirements to execute monetary policy. A sudden demand
that all banks increase their reserves would be</p>
<p>extremely disruptive and difficult for them to comply, while
loosening requirements too much would create a danger of banks
inability to meet withdrawal demands.</p>
<p>Changing the Discount Rate</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1208">The Federal Reserve was founded in the
aftermath of the 1907 Financial Panic when many banks failed as a
result of bank runs. As mentioned earlier, since banks make profits
by lending out their deposits, no bank, even those that are not
bankrupt, can withstand a bank run. As a result of the Panic, the
Federal Reserve was founded to be the “lender of last resort.” In
the event of a bank run, sound banks, (banks that were not bankrupt)
could borrow as much cash as they needed from the Fed’s discount
“window” to quell the bank run. We call the interest rate banks pay
for such loans the</span> <strong>discount rate</strong>. (They are so named
because the bank makes loans against its outstanding loans “at a
discount” of their face value.) Once depositors became convinced
that the bank would be able to honor their withdrawals, they no
longer had a reason to make a run on the bank. In short, the Federal
Reserve was originally intended to provide credit passively, but in
the years since its founding, the Fed has taken on a more active
role with monetary policy.</p>
<p>The third traditional method for conducting monetary policy is to
raise or lower the discount rate. If the central bank raises the
discount rate, then commercial banks will reduce their borrowing of
reserves from the Fed, and instead call in loans to replace those
reserves. Since fewer loans are available, the money supply falls
and market interest rates rise. If the central bank lowers the
discount rate it charges to banks, the process works in reverse.</p>
<p>In recent decades, the Federal Reserve has made relatively few
discount loans. Before a bank borrows from the Federal Reserve to
fill out its required reserves, the bank is expected to first borrow
from other available sources, like other banks. This is encouraged
by the Fed charging a higher discount rate than the federal funds
rate. Given that most banks borrow little at the discount rate,
changing the discount rate up or down has little impact on their
behavior. More importantly, the Fed has found from experience that
open market operations are a more precise and powerful means of
executing any desired monetary policy.</p>
<p>In the Federal Reserve Act, the phrase “…to afford means of
rediscounting commercial paper” is contained in its long title. This
was the main tool for monetary policy when the Fed was initially
created. This illustrates how monetary policy has evolved and how it
continues to do so.</p>

<p>The Effect of Monetary Policy on Interest Rates</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1212" class="s34">Consider the market for loanable bank funds in</a>

class="s60">2</span>, leading to an equilibrium (E<span

policy will shift the supply of loanable funds to the right from the
original supply curve (S<span class="s63">0</span>) to the new
supply curve (S<span class="s63">1</span>) and to a new equilibrium
of E<span class="s63">1</span>, reducing the interest rate from 8%
to 6%. A contractionary monetary policy will shift the supply of
loanable funds to the left from the original supply curve (S<span
class="s63">0</span>) to the new supply (S<span
class="s63">2</span>), and raise the interest rate from 8% to 10%.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1212" class="s34">How does a central bank “raise” interest rates? When describing the central bank’s monetary policy actions, it is common to hear that the central bank “raised interest rates” or “lowered interest rates.” We need to be clear about this: more precisely, through open market operations the central bank changes bank reserves in a way which affects the supply curve of loanable funds. As a result,</a>
<a href="#bookmark1212" class="a">Figure 15.7</a> <span
class="p">shows that interest rates change. If they do not meet the
Fed’s target, the Fed can supply more or less reserves until
interest rates do.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark1213">Recall that the specific interest rate the
Fed targets is the</span> <strong>federal funds rate</strong>. The Federal
Reserve has, since 1995, established its target federal funds rate
in advance of any open market operations.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1214">Of course, financial markets display a wide
range of interest rates, representing borrowers with different risk
premiums and loans that they must repay over different periods of
time. In general, when the federal funds rate drops substantially,
other interest rates drop, too, and when the federal funds rate
rises, other interest rates rise. However, a fall or rise of one
percentage point in the federal funds rate—which remember is for
borrowing overnight—will typically have an effect of less than one
percentage point on a 30-year loan to purchase a house or a
three-year loan to purchase a car. Monetary policy can push the
entire spectrum of interest rates higher or lower, but the forces of
supply and demand in those specific markets for lending and
borrowing set the specific interest rates.</span></p>
<p>The Effect of Monetary Policy on Aggregate Demand</p>
<p>Monetary policy affects interest rates and the available quantity of
loanable funds, which in turn affects several components of
aggregate demand. Tight or contractionary monetary policy that leads
to higher interest rates and a reduced quantity of loanable funds
will reduce two components of aggregate demand. Business investment
will decline because it is less attractive for firms to borrow
money, and even firms that have money will notice that, with higher
interest rates, it is relatively more attractive to put those funds
in a financial investment than to make an investment in physical
capital. In addition, higher interest rates will discourage consumer
borrowing for big-ticket items like houses and cars. Conversely,
loose or expansionary monetary policy that leads to lower interest
rates and a higher quantity of loanable funds will tend to increase
business investment and consumer borrowing for big-ticket items.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1217" id="bookmark1215" class="s34">If the economy is suffering a recession and high unemployment, with output below potential GDP, expansionary monetary policy can help the economy return to potential GDP.</a>
<a href="#bookmark1217" class="a">Figure</a> <span class="s54">15.8
</span>(a) illustrates this situation. This example uses a short-run
upward-sloping Keynesian aggregate supply curve (SRAS). The original
equilibrium during a recession of E<span class="s60">0</span> occurs
at an output level of 600. An expansionary monetary policy will
reduce interest rates and stimulate investment and consumption
spending, causing the original aggregate demand curve (AD<span
class="s60">0</span>) to shift right to AD<span
class="s60">1</span>, so that the new equilibrium (E<span
class="s60">1</span>) occurs at the potential GDP level of 700.<span

leading to the new equilibrium (E<span class="s63">1</span>) at the

<p><a href="#bookmark1217" class="s34">Conversely, if an economy is producing at a quantity of output above its potential GDP, a contractionary monetary policy can reduce the inflationary pressures for a rising price level. In</a>

</span>(b), the original equilibrium (E<span class="s60">0</span>)
occurs at an output of 750, which is above potential GDP. A
contractionary monetary policy will raise interest rates, discourage
borrowing for investment and consumption spending, and cause the
original demand curve (AD<span class="s60">0</span>) to shift left
to AD<span class="s60">1</span>, so that the new equilibrium (E<span

<p><span id="bookmark1218">These examples suggest that monetary policy
should be</span>
<strong>countercyclical</strong><a href="#bookmark1219" class="s34">; that is, it should act to counterbalance the business cycles of economic downturns and upswings. The Fed should loosen monetary policy when a recession has caused unemployment to increase and tighten it when inflation threatens. Of course, countercyclical policy does pose a danger of overreaction. If loose monetary policy seeking to end a recession goes too far, it may push aggregate demand so far to the right that it triggers inflation. If tight monetary policy seeking to reduce inflation goes too far, it may push aggregate demand so far to the left that a recession begins.</a>

policy, the central bank causes the supply of money and credit in

discouraging borrowing for investment and consumption, and shifting
aggregate demand left. The result is a lower price level and, at

<p>Federal Reserve Actions Over Last Four Decades</p>
<p>For the period from the mid-1970s up through the end of 2007, we can
summarize Federal Reserve monetary policy by looking at how it
targeted the federal funds interest rate using open market
operations.</p>
<p>Of course, telling the story of the U.S. economy since 1975 in terms
of Federal Reserve actions leaves out many other macroeconomic
factors that were influencing unemployment, recession, economic
growth, and inflation over this time. The nine episodes of Federal
Reserve action outlined in the sections below also demonstrate that
we should consider the central bank as one of the leading actors
influencing the macro economy. As we noted earlier, the single
person with the greatest power to influence the U.S. economy is
probably the Federal Reserve chairperson.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1221" id="bookmark1220" class="a">Figure 15.10</a>

and Inflation</span> <span class="s37">Through the episodes here,
the Federal Reserve typically reacted to higher inflation with a
contractionary monetary policy and a higher interest rate, and
reacted to higher unemployment with an expansionary monetary policy
and a lower interest rate.</span></p>
<p>Episode 1</p>
<p>Consider Episode 1 in the late 1970s. The rate of inflation was very
high, exceeding 10% in 1979 and 1980, so the Federal Reserve used
tight monetary policy to raise interest rates, with the federal
funds rate rising from 5.5% in 1977 to 16.4% in 1981. By 1983,
inflation was down to 3.2%, but aggregate demand contracted sharply
enough that back- to-back recessions occurred in 1980 and in
1981–1982, and the unemployment rate rose from 5.8% in 1979 to 9.7%
in 1982.</p>
<p>Episode 2</p>
<p>In Episode 2, when economists persuaded the Federal Reserve in the
early 1980s that inflation was declining, the Fed began slashing
interest rates to reduce unemployment. The federal funds interest
rate fell from 16.4% in 1981 to 6.8% in 1986. By 1986 or so,
inflation had fallen to about 2% and the unemployment rate had come
down to 7%, and was still falling.</p>
<p>Episode 3</p>
<p>However, in Episode 3 in the late 1980s, inflation appeared to be
creeping up again, rising from 2% in 1986 up toward 5% by 1989. In
response, the Federal Reserve used contractionary monetary policy to
raise the federal funds rates from 6.6% in 1987 to 9.2% in 1989. The
tighter monetary policy stopped inflation, which fell from above 5%
in 1990 to under 3% in 1992, but it also helped to cause the
1990-1991 recession, and the unemployment rate rose from 5.3% in
1989 to 7.5% by 1992.</p>
<p>Episode 4</p>
<p>In Episode 4, in the early 1990s, when the Federal Reserve was
confident that inflation was back under control, it reduced interest
rates, with the federal funds interest rate falling from 8.1% in
1990 to 3.5% in 1992. As the economy expanded, the unemployment rate
declined from 7.5% in 1992 to less than 5% by 1997.</p>
<p>Episodes 5 and 6</p>
<p>In Episodes 5 and 6, the Federal Reserve perceived a risk of
inflation and raised the federal funds rate from 3% to 5.8% from
1993 to 1995. Inflation did not rise, and the period of economic
growth during the 1990s continued. Then in 1999 and 2000, the Fed
was concerned that inflation seemed to be creeping up so it raised
the federal funds interest rate from 4.6% in December 1998 to 6.5%
in June 2000. By early 2001, inflation was declining again, but a
recession occurred in 2001. Between 2000 and 2002, the unemployment
rate rose from 4.0% to 5.8%.</p>
<p>Episodes 7 and 8</p>
<p>In Episodes 7 and 8, the Federal Reserve conducted a loose monetary
policy and slashed the federal funds rate from 6.2% in 2000 to just
1.7% in 2002, and then again to 1% in 2003. They actually did this
because of fear of Japan-style deflation. This persuaded them to
lower the Fed funds further than they otherwise would have. The
recession ended, but, unemployment rates were slow to decline in the
early 2000s. Finally, in 2004, the unemployment rate declined and
the Federal Reserve began to raise the federal funds rate until it
reached 5% by 2007.</p>
<p>Episode 9</p>
<p>In Episode 9, as the Great Recession took hold in 2008, the Federal
Reserve was quick to slash interest rates, taking them down to 2% in
2008 and to nearly 0% in 2009. When the Fed had taken interest rates
down to near-zero by December 2008, the economy was still deep in
recession. Open market operations could not make the interest rate
turn negative. The Federal Reserve had to think “outside the box.”</p>
<p>Quantitative Easing</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1222">The most powerful and commonly used of the
three traditional tools of monetary policy—open market
operations—works by expanding or contracting the money supply in a
way that influences the interest rate. In late 2008, as the U.S.
economy struggled with recession, the Federal Reserve had already
reduced the interest rate to near- zero. With the recession still
ongoing, the Fed decided to adopt an innovative and nontraditional
policy known as</span> <strong>quantitative easing (QE)</strong>. This is the
purchase of long-term government and private mortgage-backed
securities by central banks to make credit available so as to
stimulate aggregate demand.<span id="bookmark1223">‌</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark1224">Quantitative easing differed from
traditional monetary policy in several key ways. First, it involved
the Fed purchasing long term Treasury bonds, rather than short term
Treasury bills. In 2008, however, it was impossible to stimulate the
economy any further by lowering short term rates because they were
already as low as they could get. (Read the closing Bring it Home
feature for more on this.) Therefore, Chairman Bernanke sought to
lower long-term rates utilizing quantitative easing.</span></p>
<p>This leads to a second way QE is different from traditional monetary
policy. Instead of purchasing Treasury securities, the Fed also
began purchasing private mortgage-backed securities, something it
had never done before. During the financial crisis, which
precipitated the recession, mortgage-backed securities were termed
“toxic assets,” because when the housing market collapsed, no one
knew what these securities were worth, which put the financial
institutions which were holding those securities on very shaky
ground. By offering to purchase mortgage-backed securities, the Fed
was both pushing long term interest rates down and also removing
possibly “toxic assets” from the balance sheets of private financial
firms, which would strengthen the financial system.</p>
<p>Quantitative easing (QE) occurred in three episodes:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>During QE<span class="s60">1</span>, which began in November
2008, the Fed purchased $600 billion in mortgage-backed
securities from government enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac.</p></li>
<li><p>In November 2010, the Fed began QE<span class="s60">2</span>, in
which it purchased $600 billion in U.S. Treasury bonds.</p></li>
<li><p>QE<span class="s60">3</span>, began in September 2012 when the
Fed commenced purchasing <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(40 billion of additional mortgage-
backed securities per month. This amount was increased in
December 2012 to \)</span>85 billion per month. The Fed stated that,
when economic conditions permit, it will begin tapering (or
reducing the monthly purchases). By October 2014, the Fed had
announced the final $15 billion bond purchase, ending
Quantitative Easing.</p>
<p>We usually think of the quantitative easing policies that the
Federal Reserve adopted (as did other central banks around the
world) as temporary emergency measures. If these steps are to be
temporary, then the Federal Reserve will</p>
<p>need to stop making these additional loans and sell off the
financial securities it has accumulated. The concern is that the
process of quantitative easing may prove more difficult to
reverse than it was to enact. The evidence suggests that QE<span
class="s60">1</span> was somewhat successful, but that QE<span
class="s60">2</span> and QE<span class="s60">3</span> have been
less so.</p>

<p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Analyze whether monetary policy decisions should be made more
democratically</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate the velocity of money</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate the central bank’s influence on inflation,
unemployment, asset bubbles, and leverage cycles</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate the effects of monetary stimulus</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span id="bookmark1226">In the real world, effective monetary policy
faces a number of significant hurdles. Monetary policy affects the
economy only after a time lag that is typically long and of variable
length. Remember, monetary policy involves a chain of events: the
central bank must perceive a situation in the economy, hold a
meeting, and make a decision to react by tightening or loosening
monetary policy. The change in monetary policy must percolate
through the banking system, changing the quantity of loans and
affecting interest rates. When interest rates change, businesses
must change their investment levels and consumers must change their
borrowing patterns when purchasing homes or cars. Then it takes time
for these changes to filter through the rest of the economy.</span></p>
<p>As a result of this chain of events, monetary policy has little
effect in the immediate future. Instead, its primary effects are
felt perhaps one to three years in the future. The reality of long
and variable time lags does not mean that a central bank should
refuse to make decisions. It does mean that central banks should be
humble about taking action, because of the risk that their actions
can create as much or more economic instability as they resolve.</p>
<p>Excess Reserves</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1227">Banks are legally required to hold a minimum
level of reserves, but no rule prohibits them from holding
additional</span> <strong>excess reserves</strong> above the legally mandated
limit. For example, during a recession banks may be hesitant to
lend, because they fear that when the economy is contracting, a high
proportion of loan applicants become less likely to repay their
loans.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1228">When many banks are choosing to hold excess
reserves, expansionary monetary policy may not work well. This may
occur because the banks are concerned about a deteriorating economy,
while the central bank is trying to expand the money supply. If the
banks prefer to hold excess reserves above the legally required
level, the central bank cannot force individual banks to make loans.
Similarly, sensible businesses and consumers may be reluctant to
borrow substantial amounts of money in a recession, because they
recognize that firms’ sales and employees’ jobs are more insecure in
a recession, and they do not want to face the need to make interest
payments. The result is that during an especially deep recession, an
expansionary monetary policy may have little effect on either the
price level or the real GDP.</span><span id="bookmark1229">‌</span></p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_328.png" width="624" height="51" alt="image" />
<p>Japan experienced this situation in the 1990s and early 2000s.
Japan’s economy entered a period of very slow growth, dipping in and
out of recession, in the early 1990s. By February 1999, the Bank of
Japan had lowered the equivalent of its federal funds rate to 0%. It
kept it there most of the time through 2003. Moreover, in the two
years from March 2001 to March 2003, the Bank of Japan also expanded
the country’s money supply by about 50%—an enormous increase. Even
this highly expansionary monetary policy, however, had no
substantial effect on stimulating aggregate demand. Japan’s economy
continued to experience extremely slow growth into the mid-2000s.</p>
<p>Should monetary policy decisions be made more democratically?</p>
<p>Should a nation’s Congress or legislature comprised of elected
representatives conduct monetary policy or should a politically
appointed central bank that is more independent of voters take
charge? Here are some of</p>
<p>the arguments.</p>
<p>The Case for Greater Democratic Control of Monetary Policy</p>
<p>Elected representatives pass taxes and spending bills to conduct
fiscal policy by passing tax and spending bills. They could handle
monetary policy in the same way. They will sometimes make mistakes,
but in a democracy, it is better to have elected officials who are
accountable to voters make mistakes instead of political appointees.
After all, the people appointed to the top governing positions at
the Federal Reserve—and to most central banks around the world—are
typically bankers and economists. They are not representatives of
borrowers like small businesses or farmers nor are they
representatives of labor unions. Central banks might not be so quick
to raise interest rates if they had to pay more attention to firms
and people in the real economy.</p>
<p>The Case for an Independent Central Bank</p>
<p>Because the central bank has some insulation from day-to-day
politics, its members can take a nonpartisan look at specific
economic situations and make tough, immediate decisions when
necessary. The idea of giving a legislature the ability to create
money and hand out loans is likely to end up badly, sooner or later.
It is simply too tempting for lawmakers to expand the money supply
to fund their projects. The long term result will be rampant
inflation. Also, a central bank, acting according to the laws passed
by elected officials, can respond far more quickly than a
legislature. For example, the U.S. budget takes months to debate,
pass, and sign into law, but monetary policy decisions happen much
more rapidly. Day-to-day democratic control of monetary policy is
impractical and seems likely to lead to an overly expansionary
monetary policy and higher inflation.</p>
<p>The problem of excess reserves does not affect contractionary
policy. Central bankers have an old saying that monetary policy can
be like pulling and pushing on a string: when the central bank pulls
on the string and uses contractionary monetary policy, it can
definitely raise interest rates and reduce aggregate demand.
However, when the central bank tries to push on the string of
expansionary monetary policy, the string may sometimes just fold up
limp and have little effect, because banks decide not to loan out
their excess reserves. Do not take this analogy too
literally—expansionary monetary policy usually does have real
effects, after that inconveniently long and variable lag. There are
also times, like Japan’s economy in the late 1990s and early 2000s,
when expansionary monetary policy has been insufficient to lift a
recession-prone economy.</p>
<p>Unpredictable Movements of Velocity</p>
<p>Velocity is a term that economists use to describe how quickly money
circulates through the economy. We define the</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1230">velocity</span> <span class="p">of money in
a year as:</span></p>
<p>Velocity =</p>
<p>nominal GDP<span class="s16"> money supply</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark1231">Specific measurements of velocity depend on
the definition of the money supply used. Consider the velocity of
M1, the total amount of currency in circulation and checking account
balances. In 2009, for example, M1 was <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1.7 trillion and nominal GDP
was \)</span>14.3 trillion, so the velocity of M1 was 8.4 (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(14.3
trillion/\)</span>1.7 trillion). A higher velocity of money means that the
average dollar circulates more times in a year. A lower velocity
means that the average dollar circulates fewer times in a
year.</span></p>

<p>What happens during episodes of deflation?</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1232">Deflation occurs when the rate of inflation
is negative; that is, instead of money having less purchasing power
over time, as occurs with inflation, money is worth more. Deflation
can make it very difficult for monetary policy to address a
recession.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark1233">Remember that the real interest rate is the
nominal interest rate minus the rate of inflation. If the
nominal</span></p>
<p>See the following Clear It Up feature for a discussion of how
deflation could affect monetary policy.</p>
<p>interest rate is 7% and the rate of inflation is 3%, then the
borrower is effectively paying a 4% real interest rate. If the
nominal interest rate is 7% and there is <em>deflation</em> of 2%, then the
real interest rate is actually 9%. In this way, an unexpected
deflation raises the real interest payments for borrowers. It can
lead to a situation where borrowers do not repay an unexpectedly
high number of loans, and banks find that their net worth is
decreasing or negative. When banks are suffering losses, they become
less able and eager to make new loans. Aggregate demand declines,
which can lead to recession.</p>
<p>Then the double-whammy: After causing a recession, deflation can
make it difficult for monetary policy to work. Say that the central
bank uses expansionary monetary policy to reduce the nominal
interest rate all the way to zero—but the economy has 5% deflation.
As a result, the real interest rate is 5%, and because a central
bank cannot make the nominal interest rate negative, expansionary
policy cannot reduce the real interest rate further.</p>
<p>In the U.S. economy during the early 1930s, deflation was 6.7% per
year from 1930–1933, which caused many borrowers to default on their
loans and many banks to end up bankrupt, which in turn contributed
substantially to the Great Depression. Not all episodes of
deflation, however, end in economic depression. Japan, for example,
experienced deflation of slightly less than 1% per year from
1999–2002, which hurt the Japanese economy, but it still grew by
about 0.9% per year over this period. There is at least one
historical example of deflation coexisting with rapid growth. The
U.S. economy experienced deflation of about 1.1% per year over the
quarter-century from 1876–1900, but real GDP also expanded at a
rapid clip of 4% per year over this time, despite some occasional
severe recessions.</p>
<p>The central bank should be on guard against deflation and, if
necessary, use expansionary monetary policy to prevent any
long-lasting or extreme deflation from occurring. Except in severe
cases like the Great Depression, deflation does not guarantee
economic disaster.</p>
<p>Changes in velocity can cause problems for monetary policy. To
understand why, rewrite the definition of velocity so that the money
supply is on the left-hand side of the equation. That is:</p>
<p>Money supply × velocity = Nominal GDP</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark432" class="s34">Recall from</a>
<a href="#bookmark432" class="a">The Macroeconomic Perspective</a>
<span class="p">that</span></p>
<p>Nominal GDP = Price Level (or GDP Deflator) × Real GDP.</p>
<p>Therefore,</p>
<p>Money Supply × velocity = Nominal GDP = Price Level × Real GDP.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1234">We sometimes call this equation the</span>
<strong>basic quantity equation of money</strong> but, as you can see, it is just
the definition of velocity written in a different form. This
equation must hold true, by definition.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1235">If velocity is constant over time, then a
certain percentage rise in the money supply on the left-hand side of
the basic quantity equation of money will inevitably lead to the
same percentage rise in nominal GDP—although this change could
happen through an increase in inflation, or an increase in real GDP,
or some combination of the two. If velocity is changing over time
but in a constant and predictable way, then changes in the money
supply will continue to have a predictable effect on nominal GDP. If
velocity changes unpredictably over time, however, then the effect
of changes in the money supply on nominal GDP becomes
unpredictable.</span><span id="bookmark1236">‌</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1238" id="bookmark1237" class="a">Figure 15.11</a>
<span class="p">illustrates the actual velocity of money in the U.S.
economy as measured by using M1, the most common definition of the
money supply. From 1960 up to about 1980, velocity appears fairly
predictable; that is, it is increasing at a fairly constant rate. In
the early 1980s, however, velocity as calculated with M1 becomes
more variable. The reasons for these sharp changes in velocity
remain a puzzle. Economists suspect that the changes in velocity are
related to innovations in banking and finance which have changed how
we are using money in making economic transactions: for example, the
growth of electronic payments; a rise in personal borrowing and
credit card usage; and accounts that make it easier for people to
hold money in savings accounts, where it is counted as M2, right up
to the moment that they want to write a check on the money and
transfer it to M1. So far at least, it has proven difficult to draw
clear links between these kinds of factors and the specific
up-and-down fluctuations in M1. Given many changes in banking and
the prevalence of electronic banking, economists now favor M2 as a
measure of money rather than the narrower M1.</span></p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_330.jpg" width="471" height="222" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark1238">Figure 15.11 Velocity Calculated Using
M1</span> <span class="s37">Velocity is the nominal GDP divided by
the money supply for a given year. We can calculate different
measures of velocity by using different measures of the money
supply. Velocity, as calculated by using M1, has lacked a steady
trend since the 1980s, instead bouncing up and down. (credit:
Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis)</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark1239">In the 1970s, when velocity as measured by
M1 seemed predictable, a number of economists, led by Nobel laureate
Milton Friedman (1912–2006), argued that the best monetary policy
was for the central bank to increase the money supply at a constant
growth rate. These economists argued that with the long and variable
lags of monetary policy, and the political pressures on central
bankers, central bank monetary policies were as likely to have
undesirable as to have desirable effects. Thus, these economists
believed that the monetary policy should seek steady growth in the
money supply of 3% per year. They argued that a steady monetary
growth rate would be correct over longer time periods, since it
would roughly match the growth of the real economy. In addition,
they argued that giving the central bank less discretion to conduct
monetary policy would prevent an overly activist central bank from
becoming a source of economic instability and uncertainty. In this
spirit, Friedman wrote in 1967: “The first and most important lesson
that history teaches about what monetary policy can do—and it is a
lesson of the most profound importance—is that monetary policy can
prevent money itself from being a major source of economic
disturbance.”</span></p>
<p>As the velocity of M1 began to fluctuate in the 1980s, having the
money supply grow at a predetermined and unchanging rate seemed less
desirable, because as the quantity theory of money shows, the
combination of constant growth in the money supply and fluctuating
velocity would cause nominal GDP to rise and fall in unpredictable
ways. The jumpiness of velocity in the 1980s caused many central
banks to focus less on the rate at which the quantity of money in
the economy was increasing, and instead to set monetary policy by
reacting to whether the economy was experiencing or in danger of
higher inflation or unemployment.</p>
<p>Unemployment and Inflation</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1242" id="bookmark1240" class="s34">If you were to survey central bankers around the world and ask them what they believe should be the primary task of monetary policy, the most popular answer by far would be fighting inflation. Most central bankers believe that the neoclassical model of economics accurately represents the economy over the medium to long term. Remember that in the neoclassical model of the economy, we draw the aggregate supply curve as a vertical line at the level of potential GDP, as</a>
<a href="#bookmark1242" class="a">Figure 15.12</a><span class="s54">
</span>shows. In the neoclassical model, economists determine the
level of potential GDP (and the natural rate of unemployment that
exists when the economy is producing at potential GDP) by real
economic factors. If the original level of aggregate demand is
AD<span class="s60">0</span>, then an expansionary monetary policy
that shifts aggregate demand to AD<span class="s60">1</span> only
creates an inflationary increase in the price level, but it does not
alter GDP or unemployment. From this perspective, all that monetary
policy can do is to lead to low inflation or high inflation—and low
inflation provides a better climate for a healthy and growing
economy. After all, low inflation means that businesses making
investments can focus on real economic issues, not on figuring out
ways to protect themselves from the costs and risks of inflation. In
this way, a consistent pattern of low inflation can contribute to
long-term growth.<span id="bookmark1241">‌</span></p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_331.jpg" width="237" height="198" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark1242"><span class="s36">Figure 15.12 Monetary
Policy in a Neoclassical Model </span></span>In a neoclassical view,
monetary policy affects only the price level, not the level of
output in the economy. For example, an expansionary monetary policy
causes aggregate demand to shift from the original AD<span
class="s63">0</span> to AD<span class="s63">1</span>. However, the
adjustment of the economy from the original equilibrium (E<span
class="s63">0</span>) to the new equilibrium (E<span
class="s63">1</span>) represents an inflationary increase in the
price level from P<span class="s63">0</span> to P<span
class="s63">1</span>, but has no effect in the long run on output or
the unemployment rate. In fact, no shift in AD will affect the
equilibrium quantity of output in this model.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1243">This vision of focusing monetary policy on a
low rate of inflation is so attractive that many countries have
rewritten their central banking laws since in the 1990s to have
their bank practice</span> <strong>inflation targeting</strong>, which means that
the central bank is legally required to focus primarily on keeping
inflation low. By 2014, central banks in 28 countries, including
Austria, Brazil, Canada, Israel, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Spain,
Sweden, Thailand, and the United Kingdom faced a legal requirement
to target the inflation rate. A notable exception is the Federal
Reserve in the United States, which does not practice
inflation-targeting. Instead, the law governing the Federal Reserve
requires it to take both unemployment and inflation into
account.<span id="bookmark1244">‌</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark1245">Economists have no final consensus on
whether a central bank should be required to focus only on inflation
or should have greater discretion. For those who subscribe to the
inflation targeting philosophy, the fear is that politicians who are
worried about slow economic growth and unemployment will constantly
pressure the central bank to conduct a loose monetary policy—even if
the economy is already producing at potential GDP. In some
countries, the central bank may lack the political power to resist
such pressures, with the result of higher inflation, but no
long-term reduction in unemployment. The U.S. Federal Reserve has a
tradition of independence, but central banks in other countries may
be under greater political pressure. For all of these reasons—long
and variable lags, excess reserves, unstable velocity, and
controversy over economic goals—monetary policy in the real world is
often difficult. The basic message remains, however, that central
banks can affect aggregate demand through the conduct of monetary
policy and in that way influence macroeconomic outcomes.</span></p>
<p>Asset Bubbles and Leverage Cycles</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1246">One long-standing concern about having the
central bank focus on inflation and unemployment is that it may be
overlooking certain other economic problems that are coming in the
future. For example, from 1994 to 2000 during what was known as the
“dot-com” boom, the U.S. stock market, which the Dow Jones
Industrial Index measures (which includes 30 very large companies
from across the U.S. economy), nearly tripled in value. The Nasdaq
index, which includes many smaller technology companies, increased
in value by a multiple of five from 1994 to 2000. These rates of
increase were clearly not sustainable. Stock values as measured by
the Dow Jones were almost 20% lower in 2009 than they had been
in 2000. Stock values in the Nasdaq index were 50% lower in 2009
than they had been in 2000. The drop-off in stock market values
contributed to the 2001 recession and the higher unemployment that
followed.</span><span id="bookmark1247">‌</span></p>
<p>We can tell a similar story about housing prices in the mid-2000s.
During the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, housing prices increased at
about 6% per year on average. During what came to be known as the
“housing bubble” from 2003 to 2005, housing prices increased at
almost double this annual rate. These rates of increase were clearly
not sustainable. When housing prices fell in 2007 and 2008, many
banks and households found that their assets were worth less than
they expected, which contributed to the recession that started
in 2007.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1248">At a broader level, some economists worry
about a leverage cycle, where “leverage” is a term financial
economists</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark1249">use to mean “borrowing.” When economic times
are good, banks and the financial sector are eager to lend, and
people and firms are eager to borrow. Remember that a money
multiplier determines the amount of money and credit in an economy
—a process of loans made, money deposited, and more loans made. In
good economic times, this surge of lending exaggerates the episode
of economic growth. It can even be part of what lead prices of
certain assets—like stock prices or housing prices—to rise at
unsustainably high annual rates. At some point, when economic times
turn bad, banks and the financial sector become much less willing to
lend, and credit becomes expensive or unavailable to many potential
borrowers. The sharp reduction in credit, perhaps combined with the
deflating prices of a dot-com stock price bubble or a housing
bubble, makes the economic downturn worse than it would otherwise
be.</span></p>
<p>Thus, some economists have suggested that the central bank should
not just look at economic growth, inflation, and unemployment rates,
but should also keep an eye on asset prices and leverage cycles.
Such proposals are quite controversial. If a central bank had
announced in 1997 that stock prices were rising “too fast” or in
2004 that housing prices were rising “too fast,” and then taken
action to hold down price increases, many people and their elected
political representatives would have been outraged. Neither the
Federal Reserve nor any other central banks want to take the
responsibility of deciding when stock prices and housing prices are
too high, too low, or just right. As further research explores how
asset price bubbles and leverage cycles can affect an economy,
central banks may need to think about whether they should conduct
monetary policy in a way that would seek to moderate these effects.</p>

<p>Calculating the Effects of Monetary Stimulus</p>
<p>Suppose that the central bank wants to stimulate the economy by
increasing the money supply. The bankers estimate that the velocity
of money is 3, and that the price level will increase from 100 to
110 due to the stimulus. Using the quantity equation of money, what
will be the impact of an <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(800 billion dollar increase in the money
supply on the quantity of goods and services in the economy given an
initial money supply of \)</span>4 trillion?</p>
<p>Step 1. We begin by writing the quantity equation of money: MV = PQ.
We know that initially V = 3, M = 4,000 (billion) and P = 100.
Substituting these numbers in, we can solve for Q:</p>
<p>MV = PQ 4,000 × 3 = 100 × Q</p>
<p>Q = 120</p>
<p>Step 2. Now we want to find the effect of the addition $800 billion
in the money supply, together with the increase in the price level.
The new equation is:</p>
<p>MV = PQ 4,800 × 3 = 110 × Q</p>
<p>Q = 130.9</p>
<p>Step 3. If we take the difference between the two quantities, we
find that the monetary stimulus increased the quantity of goods and
services in the economy by 10.9 billion.</p>
<p>Let’s end this chapter with a Work it Out exercise in how the Fed—or
any central bank—would stir up the economy by increasing the money
supply.</p>

<p>The Problem of the Zero Percent Interest Rate Lower Bound</p>
<p>In 2008, the U.S. Federal Reserve found itself in a difficult
position. The federal funds rate was on its way to near zero, which
meant that traditional open market operations, by which the Fed
purchases U.S. Treasury Bills to lower short term interest rates,
was no longer viable. This so called “zero bound problem,” prompted
the Fed, under then Chair Ben Bernanke, to attempt some
unconventional policies, collectively called quantitative easing. By
early 2014, quantitative easing nearly quintupled the amount of bank
reserves. This likely contributed to the U.S. economy’s recovery,
but the impact was muted, probably due to some of the hurdles
mentioned in the last section of this module. The unprecedented
increase in bank reserves also led to fears of inflation. As of
early 2015, however, there have been no serious signs of a boom,
with core inflation around a stable 1.7%.</p>

<p>KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY</p>
<ol>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark1178" class="a">The Federal Reserve Banking System and Central</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark1178">Banks</a></p>
<p>The most prominent task of a central bank is to conduct monetary
policy, which involves changes to interest rates and credit
conditions, affecting the amount of borrowing and spending in an
economy. Some prominent central banks around the world include
the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of
Japan, and the Bank of England.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark1187" class="a">Bank</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark1187">Regulation</a></p>
<p>A bank run occurs when there are rumors (possibly true, possibly
false) that a bank is at financial risk of having negative net
worth. As a result, depositors rush to the bank to withdraw
their money and put it someplace safer. Even false rumors, if
they cause a bank run, can force a healthy bank to lose its
deposits and be forced to close. Deposit insurance guarantees
bank depositors that, even if the bank has negative net worth,
their deposits will be protected. In</p>
<p>the United States, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(FDIC) collects deposit insurance premiums from banks and
guarantees bank deposits up to $250,000. Bank supervision
involves inspecting the balance sheets of banks to make sure
that they have positive net worth and that their assets are not
too risky. In the United States, the Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency (OCC) is responsible for supervising banks and
inspecting savings and loans and the National Credit Union
Administration (NCUA) is responsible for inspecting credit
unions. The FDIC and the Federal Reserve also play a role in
bank supervision.</p>
<p>When a central bank acts as a lender of last resort, it makes
short-term loans available in situations of severe financial
panic or stress. The failure of a single bank can be treated
like any other business failure. Yet if many banks fail, it can
reduce aggregate demand in a way that can bring on or deepen a
recession. The combination of deposit insurance, bank
supervision, and lender of last resort policies help to prevent
weaknesses in the banking system from causing recessions.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark1199" class="a">How a Central Bank Executes Monetary</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark1199">Policy</a></p>
<p>A central bank has three traditional tools to conduct monetary
policy: open market operations, which involves buying and
selling government bonds with banks; reserve requirements, which
determine what level of reserves a bank is legally required to
hold; and discount rates, which is the interest rate charged by
the central bank on the loans that it gives to other commercial
banks. The most commonly used tool is open market operations.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark1209" class="a">Monetary Policy and Economic</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark1209">Outcomes</a></p>
<p>An expansionary (or loose) monetary policy raises the quantity
of money and credit above what it otherwise would have been and
reduces interest rates, boosting aggregate demand, and thus
countering recession. A contractionary monetary policy, also
called a tight monetary policy, reduces the quantity of money
and credit below what it otherwise would have been and raises
interest rates, seeking to hold down inflation. During the
2008–2009 recession, central banks around the world also used
quantitative easing to expand the supply of credit.</p>

<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark1225">Policy</a></p></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Monetary policy is inevitably imprecise, for a number of reasons: (a)
the effects occur only after long and variable lags; (b) if banks decide
to hold excess reserves, monetary policy cannot force them to lend; and
(c) velocity may shift in unpredictable ways. The basic quantity
equation of money is MV = PQ, where M is the money supply, V is the
velocity of money, P is the price level, and Q is the real output of the
economy. Some central banks, like the European Central Bank, practice
inflation targeting, which means that the only goal of the central bank
is to keep inflation within a low target range. Other central banks,
such as the U.S. Federal Reserve, are free to focus on either reducing
inflation or stimulating an economy that is in recession, whichever goal
seems most important at the time.</p>

<p>Is a Stronger Dollar Good for the U.S. Economy?</p>
<p>From 2002 to 2008, the U.S. dollar lost more than a quarter of its value
in foreign currency markets. On January 1, 2002, one dollar was worth
1.11 euros. On April 24, 2008 it hit its lowest point with a dollar
being worth 0.64 euros. During this period, the trade deficit between
the United States and the European Union grew from a yearly total of
approximately –85.7 billion dollars in 2002 to 95.8 billion dollars in
2008. Was this a good thing or a bad thing for the U.S. economy?</p>
<p>We live in a global world. U.S. consumers buy trillions of dollars worth
of imported goods and services each year, not just from the European
Union, but from all over the world. U.S. businesses sell trillions of
dollars’ worth of exports. U.S. citizens, businesses, and governments
invest trillions of dollars abroad every year. Foreign investors,
businesses, and governments invest trillions of dollars in the United
States each year. Indeed, foreigners are a major buyer of U.S. federal
debt.</p>
<p>Many people feel that a weaker dollar is bad for America, that it’s an
indication of a weak economy, but is it? This chapter will help answer
that question.</p>

<p>The world has over 150 different currencies, from the Afghanistan
afghani and the Albanian lek all the way through the alphabet to the
Zambian kwacha and the Zimbabwean dollar. For international economic
transactions, households or firms will wish to exchange one currency for
another. Perhaps the need for exchanging currencies will come from a
German firm that exports products to Russia, but then wishes to exchange
the Russian rubles it has earned for euros, so that the firm can pay its
workers and suppliers in Germany. Perhaps it will be a South African
firm that wishes to purchase a mining operation in Angola, but to make
the purchase it must convert South African rand to Angolan kwanza.
Perhaps it will be an American tourist visiting China, who wishes to
convert U.S. dollars to Chinese yuan to pay the hotel bill.</p>
<p>Exchange rates can sometimes change very swiftly. For example, in the
United Kingdom the pound was worth about</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1.50 just before the nation voted to leave the European Union (also
known as the Brexit vote), but fell to \)</span>1.37 just after the vote and
continued falling to reach 30-year lows a few months later. For firms
engaged in international buying, selling, lending, and borrowing, these
swings in exchange rates can have an enormous effect on profits.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1286">This chapter discusses the international
dimension of money, which involves conversions from one currency to
another at an exchange rate. An exchange rate is nothing more than a
price—that is, the price of one currency in terms of another
currency—and so we can analyze it with the tools of supply and demand.
The first module of this chapter begins with an overview of foreign
exchange markets: their size, their main participants, and the
vocabulary for discussing movements of exchange rates. The following
module uses demand and supply graphs to analyze some of the main factors
that cause shifts in exchange rates. A final module then brings the
central bank and monetary policy back into the picture. Each country
must decide whether to allow the market to determine its exchange rate,
or have the central bank intervene. All the choices for exchange rate
policy involve distinctive tradeoffs and risks.</span><span

<p><span id="bookmark1289">Most countries have different currencies,

have decided to</span> <strong>dollarize</strong>—that is, to use the</p>

nations share a common currency. A large-scale example of a common
currency is the decision by 17 European nations—including some very
large economies such as France, Germany, and Italy—to replace their
former currencies with the euro. With these exceptions, most of the
international economy takes place in a situation of multiple
national currencies in which both people and firms need to convert
from one currency to another when selling, buying, hiring,
borrowing, traveling, or investing across national borders. We call

prices, whether in this course, any other economics course, in
public policy, or business examples, is the operation of supply and
demand in markets.</p>
<p>The Extraordinary Size of the Foreign Exchange Markets</p>
<p>The quantities traded in foreign exchange markets are breathtaking.
A 2013 Bank of International Settlements survey found that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(5.3
trillion *per day* was traded on foreign exchange markets, which
makes the foreign exchange market the largest market in the world
economy. In contrast, 2013 U.S. real GDP was \)</span>15.8 trillion <em>per

<p>Table 16.1 Currencies Traded Most on Foreign Exchange Markets as of
April, 2016

<p>Demanders and Suppliers of Currency in Foreign Exchange Markets</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1293">In foreign exchange markets, demand and
supply become closely interrelated, because a person or firm who
demands one currency must at the same time supply another
currency—and vice versa. To get a sense of this, it is useful to
consider four groups of people or firms who participate in the
market: (1) firms that are involved in international trade of goods
and services; (2) tourists visiting other countries; (3)
international investors buying ownership (or part- ownership) of a
foreign firm; (4) international investors making financial
investments that do not involve ownership. Let’s consider these
categories in turn.</span></p>
<p>Firms that buy and sell on international markets find that their
costs for workers, suppliers, and investors are measured</p>
<p>in the currency of the nation where their production occurs, but
their revenues from sales are measured in the currency of the
different nation where their sales happened. Thus, a Chinese firm
exporting abroad will earn some other currency—say, U.S. dollars—but
will need Chinese yuan to pay the workers, suppliers, and investors
who are based in China. In the foreign exchange markets, this firm
will be a supplier of U.S. dollars and a demander of Chinese yuan.</p>
<p>International tourists will supply their home currency to receive
the currency of the country they are visiting. For example, an
American tourist who is visiting China will supply U.S. dollars into
the foreign exchange market and demand Chinese yuan.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1294">We often divide financial investments that
cross international boundaries, and require exchanging currency into
two categories.</span> <strong>Foreign direct investment (FDI)</strong> refers to
purchasing a firm (at least ten percent) in another country or
starting up a new enterprise in a foreign country For example, in
2008 the Belgian beer-brewing company InBev bought the U.S.
beer-maker Anheuser-Busch for $52 billion. To make this purchase,
InBev would have to supply euros (the currency of Belgium) to the
foreign exchange market and demand U.S. dollars.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1295">The other kind of international financial
investment,</span> <strong>portfolio investment</strong>, involves a purely
financial investment that does not entail any management
responsibility. An example would be a U.S. financial investor who
purchased</p>
<p>U.K. government bonds, or deposited money in a British bank. To make
such investments, the American investor would supply U.S. dollars in
the foreign exchange market and demand British pounds.</p>
<p>Business people often link portfolio investment to expectations
about how exchange rates will shift. Look at a U.S. financial
investor who is considering purchasing U.K. issued bonds. For
simplicity, ignore any bond interest payment (which will be small in
the short run anyway) and focus on exchange rates. Say that a
British pound is currently worth</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1296" class="s34"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1.50 in U.S. currency. However, the investor believes that in a month, the British pound will be worth \)</span>1.60 in U.S. currency. Thus, as</a>
<a href="#bookmark1296" class="a">Figure 16.2</a>
<a href="#bookmark1296" class="s34">(a) shows, this investor would change <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(24,000 for 16,000 British pounds. In a month, if the pound is worth \)</span>1.60, then the portfolio investor can trade back to U.S. dollars at the new exchange rate, and have <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(25,600—a nice profit. A portfolio investor who believes that the foreign exchange rate for the pound will work in the opposite direction can also invest accordingly. Say that an investor expects that the pound, now worth \)</span>1.50 in U.S. currency, will decline to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1.40. Then, as&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;#bookmark1296&quot; class=&quot;a&quot;&gt;Figure 16.2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span
class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(b) shows, that investor could start off with £20,000 in
British currency (borrowing the money if necessary), convert it to
\)</span>30,000 in U.S. currency, wait a month, and then convert back to
approximately £21,429 in British currency—again making a nice
profit. Of course, this kind of investing comes without guarantees,
and an investor will suffer losses if the exchange rates do not move
as predicted.</span></p>

<p><span id="bookmark1296">Figure 16.2 A Portfolio Investor Trying to
Benefit from Exchange Rate Movements</span> <span
class="s37">Expectations of a currency’s future value can drive its
demand and supply in foreign exchange markets.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark1297">Many portfolio investment decisions are not
as simple as betting that the currency’s value will change in one
direction or the other. Instead, they involve firms trying to
protect themselves from movements in exchange rates. Imagine you are
running a U.S. firm that is exporting to France. You have signed a
contract to deliver certain products and will receive 1 million
euros a year from now. However, you do not know how much this
contract will be worth in U.S. dollars, because the dollar/euro
exchange rate can fluctuate in the next year. Let’s say you want to
know for sure what the contract will be worth, and not take a risk
that the euro will be worth less in U.S. dollars than it currently
is. You can</span> <strong>hedge</strong>, which means using a financial
transaction to protect yourself against a risk from one of your
investments (in this case, currency risk from the contract).
Specifically, you can sign a financial contract and pay a fee that
guarantees you a certain exchange rate one year from now—regardless
of what the market exchange rate is at that time. Now, it is
possible that the euro will be worth more in dollars a year from
now, so your hedging contract will be unnecessary, and you will have
paid a fee for nothing. However, if the value of the euro in dollars
declines, then you are protected by the hedge. When parties wish to
enter financial contracts like hedging, they normally rely on a
financial institution or brokerage company to handle the hedging.
These companies either take a fee or create a spread in the exchange
rate in order to earn money through the service they provide.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1298" class="s34">Both foreign direct investment and portfolio investment involve an investor who supplies domestic currency and demands a foreign currency. With portfolio investment, the client purchases less than ten percent of a company. As such, business players often get involved with portfolio investment with a short term focus. With foreign direct investment the investor purchases more than ten percent of a company and the investor typically assumes some managerial responsibility. Thus, foreign direct investment tends to have a more long-run focus. As a practical matter, an investor can withdraw portfolio investments from a country much more quickly than foreign direct investments. A U.S. portfolio investor who wants to buy or sell U.K. government bonds can do so with a phone call or a few computer keyboard clicks. However, a U.S. firm that wants to buy or sell a company, such as one that manufactures automobile parts in the United Kingdom, will find that planning and carrying out the transaction takes a few weeks, even months.</a>

<p>Table 16.2 The Demand and Supply Line-ups in Foreign Exchange
Markets</p>
<p>Participants in the Exchange Rate Market</p>
<p>The foreign exchange market does not involve the ultimate suppliers
and demanders of foreign exchange literally seeking each other. If
Martina decides to leave her home in Venezuela and take a trip in
the United States, she does not need to find a U.S. citizen who is
planning to take a vacation in Venezuela and arrange a
person-to-person currency trade. Instead, the foreign exchange
market works through financial institutions, and it operates on
several levels.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1299">Most people and firms who are exchanging a
substantial quantity of currency go to a bank, and most banks
provide foreign exchange as a service to customers. These banks (and
a few other firms), known as dealers, then trade the foreign
exchange. This is called the interbank market.</span><span
id="bookmark1300">‌</span></p>
<p>In the world economy, roughly 2,000 firms are foreign exchange
dealers. The U.S. economy has less than 100 foreign exchange
dealers, but the largest 12 or so dealers carry out more than half
the total transactions. The foreign exchange market has no central
location, but the major dealers keep a close watch on each other at
all times.</p>
<p>The foreign exchange market is huge not because of the demands of
tourists, firms, or even foreign direct investment, but instead
because of portfolio investment and the actions of interlocking
foreign exchange dealers. International tourism is a very large
industry, involving about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1 trillion per year. Global exports are
about 23% of global GDP; which is about \)</span>18 trillion per year.
Foreign direct investment totaled about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1.5 trillion in the end
of 2013. These quantities are dwarfed, however, by the \)</span>5.3 trillion
<em>per day</em> traded in foreign exchange markets. Most transactions in
the foreign exchange market are for portfolio investment—relatively
short-term movements of financial capital between currencies—and
because of the large foreign exchange dealers’ actions as they
constantly buy and sell with each other.</p>
<p>Strengthening and Weakening Currency</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1301">When the prices of most goods and services
change, the price “rises or “falls”. For exchange rates, the
terminology is different. When the exchange rate for a currency
rises, so that the currency exchanges for more of other currencies,
we refer to it as</span> <strong>appreciating</strong> or “strengthening.” When
the exchange rate for a currency falls, so that a currency trades
for less of other currencies, we refer to it as <strong>depreciating</strong> or
“weakening.”<span id="bookmark1302">‌</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1303" class="s34">To illustrate the use of these terms, consider the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar since 1980, in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1303" class="a">Figure 16.3</a>
<a href="#bookmark1303" class="s34">(a). The vertical axis in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1303" class="a">Figure 16.3</a> <span
class="p">(a) shows the price of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1 in U.S. currency, measured in
terms of Canadian currency. Clearly, exchange rates can move up and
down substantially. A U.S. dollar traded for \)</span>1.17 Canadian in 1980.
The U.S. dollar appreciated or strengthened to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1.39 Canadian in
1986, depreciated or weakened to \)</span>1.15 Canadian in 1991, and then
appreciated or strengthened to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1.60 Canadian by early in 2002, fell
to roughly \)</span>1.20 Canadian in 2009, and then had a sharp spike up and
decline in 2009 and 2010. In May of 2017, the U.S. dollar stood at
$1.36 Canadian. The units in which we measure exchange rates can be
confusing, because we measure the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar
exchange using a different currency—the Canadian dollar. However,
exchange rates always measure the price of one unit of currency by
using a different currency.</span></p>

<p><span id="bookmark1303">Figure 16.3 Strengthen or Appreciate vs.
Weaken or Depreciate</span> <span class="s37">Exchange rates tend to
fluctuate substantially, even between bordering companies such as
the United States and Canada. By looking closely at the time values
(the years vary slightly on these graphs), it is clear that the
values in part (a) are a mirror image of part (b), which
demonstrates that the depreciation of one currency correlates to the
appreciation of the other and vice versa. This means that when
comparing the exchange rates between two countries (in this case,
the United States and Canada), the depreciation (or weakening) of
one country (the U.S. dollar for this example) indicates the
appreciation (or strengthening) of the other currency (which in this
example is the Canadian dollar). (Source: Federal Reserve Economic

<p><a href="#bookmark1305" class="s34">With the price of a typical good or service, it is clear that higher prices benefit sellers and hurt buyers, while lower prices benefit buyers and hurt sellers. In the case of exchange rates, where the buyers and sellers are not always intuitively obvious, it is useful to trace how a stronger or weaker currency will affect different market participants. Consider, for example, the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on six different groups of economic actors, as</a>
<a href="#bookmark1305" class="a">Figure</a> 16.4 <span
class="p">shows: (1) U.S. exporters selling abroad; (2) foreign
exporters (that is, firms selling imports in the U.S.
economy);</span></p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>U.S. tourists abroad; (4) foreign tourists visiting the United
States; (5) U.S. investors (either foreign direct investment or
portfolio investment) considering opportunities in other
countries; (6) and foreign investors considering opportunities
in the U.S. economy.</p></li>

<p><span id="bookmark1305">Figure 16.4 How Do Exchange Rate Movements
Affect Each Group?</span> <span class="s37">Exchange rate movements
affect exporters, tourists, and international investors in different
ways.</span></p>
<p>For a U.S. firm selling abroad, a stronger U.S. dollar is a curse. A
strong U.S. dollar means that foreign currencies are correspondingly
weak. When this exporting firm earns foreign currencies through its
export sales, and then converts them back to U.S. dollars to pay
workers, suppliers, and investors, the stronger dollar means that
the foreign currency buys fewer U.S. dollars than if the currency
had not strengthened, and that the firm’s profits (as measured in
dollars) fall. As a result, the firm may choose to reduce its
exports, or it may raise its selling price, which will also tend to
reduce its exports. In this way, a stronger currency reduces a
country’s exports.</p>
<p>Conversely, for a foreign firm selling in the U.S. economy, a
stronger dollar is a blessing. Each dollar earned through export
sales, when traded back into the exporting firm’s home currency,
will now buy more home currency than expected before the dollar had
strengthened. As a result, the stronger dollar means that the
importing firm will earn higher profits than expected. The firm will
seek to expand its sales in the U.S. economy, or it may reduce
prices, which will also lead to expanded sales. In this way, a
stronger U.S. dollar means that consumers will purchase more from
foreign producers, expanding the country’s level of imports.</p>
<p>For a U.S. tourist abroad, who is exchanging U.S. dollars for
foreign currency as necessary, a stronger U.S. dollar is a benefit.
The tourist receives more foreign currency for each U.S. dollar, and
consequently the cost of the trip in</p>
<p>U.S. dollars is lower. When a country’s currency is strong, it is a
good time for citizens of that country to tour abroad. Imagine a
U.S. tourist who has saved up <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(5,000 for a trip to South Africa. In
2010, \)</span>1 bought 7.3 South African rand, so the tourist had 36,500
rand to spend. In 2012, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1 bought 8.2 rand, so the tourist had
41,000 rand to spend. By 2015, \)</span>1 bought nearly 13 rand. Clearly,
more recent years have been better for U.S. tourists to visit South
Africa. For foreign visitors to the United States, the opposite
pattern holds true. A relatively stronger U.S. dollar means that
their own currencies are relatively weaker, so that as they shift
from their own currency to U.S. dollars, they have fewer</p>
<p>U.S. dollars than previously. When a country’s currency is strong,
it is not an especially good time for foreign tourists to visit.</p>
<p>A stronger dollar injures the prospects of a U.S. financial investor
who has already invested money in another country. A U.S. financial
investor abroad must first convert U.S. dollars to a foreign
currency, invest in a foreign country, and then later convert that
foreign currency back to U.S. dollars. If in the meantime the U.S.
dollar becomes stronger and</p>
<p>the foreign currency becomes weaker, then when the investor converts
back to U.S. dollars, the rate of return on that investment will be
less than originally expected at the time it was made.</p>
<p>However, a stronger U.S. dollar boosts the returns of a foreign
investor putting money into a U.S. investment. That foreign investor
converts from the home currency to U.S. dollars and seeks a U.S.
investment, while later planning to switch back to the home
currency. If, in the meantime, the dollar grows stronger, then when
the time comes to convert from U.S. dollars back to the foreign
currency, the investor will receive more foreign currency than
expected at the time the original investment was made.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1305" class="s34">The preceding paragraphs all focus on the case where the U.S. dollar becomes stronger. The first column in</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark1305">Figure</a></p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_340.png" width="624" height="668" alt="image" />
<p>16.4 <span class="p">illustrates the corresponding happy or unhappy
economic reactions. The following Work It Out feature centers the
analysis on the opposite: a weaker dollar.</span></p>
<p>Effects of a Weaker Dollar</p>
<p>Let’s work through the effects of a weaker dollar on a U.S.
exporter, a foreign exporter into the United States, a U.S. tourist
going abroad, a foreign tourist coming to the United States, a U.S.
investor abroad, and a foreign investor in the United States.</p>
<p>Step 1. Note that the demand for U.S. exports is a function of the
price of those exports, which depends on the dollar price of those
goods and the exchange rate of the dollar in terms of foreign
currency. For example, a Ford pickup truck costs $25,000 in the
United States. When it is sold in the United Kingdom, the price is</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(25,000 / \)</span>1.30 per British pound, or £19,231. The dollar affects
the price foreigners face who may purchase</p>
<p>U.S. exports.</p>
<p>Step 2. Consider that, if the dollar weakens, the pound rises in
value. If the pound rises to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2.00 per pound, then the price of a
Ford pickup is now \)</span>25,000 / $2.00 = £12,500. A weaker dollar means
the foreign currency buys more dollars, which means that U.S.
exports appear less expensive.</p>
<p>Step 3. Summarize that a weaker U.S. dollar leads to an increase in
U.S. exports. For a foreign exporter, the outcome is just the
opposite.</p>
<p>Step 4. Suppose a brewery in England is interested in selling its
Bass Ale to a grocery store in the United States. If the price of a
six pack of Bass Ale is £6.00 and the exchange rate is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1.30 per
British pound, the price for the grocery store is 6.00 × \)</span>1.30 =
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(7.80 per six pack. If the dollar weakens to \)</span>2.00 per pound, the
price of Bass Ale is now 6.00 × <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2.00 = \)</span>12.</p>
<p>Step 5. Summarize that, from the perspective of U.S. purchasers, a
weaker dollar means that foreign currency is more expensive, which
means that foreign goods are more expensive also. This leads to a
decrease in U.S. imports, which is bad for the foreign exporter.</p>
<p>Step 6. Consider U.S. tourists going abroad. They face the same
situation as a U.S. importer—they are purchasing a foreign trip. A
weaker dollar means that their trip will cost more, since a given
expenditure of foreign currency (e.g., hotel bill) will take more
dollars. The result is that the tourist may not stay as long abroad,
and some may choose not to travel at all.</p>
<p>Step 7. Consider that, for the foreign tourist to the United States,
a weaker dollar is a boon. It means their currency goes further, so
the cost of a trip to the United States will be less. Foreigners may
choose to take longer trips to the United States, and more foreign
tourists may decide to take U.S. trips.</p>
<p>Step 8. Note that a U.S. investor abroad faces the same situation as
a U.S. importer—they are purchasing a foreign asset. A U.S. investor
will see a weaker dollar as an increase in the “price” of
investment, since the same number of dollars will buy less foreign
currency and thus less foreign assets. This should decrease the
amount of U.S. investment abroad.</p>
<p>Step 9. Note also that foreign investors in the Unites States will
have the opposite experience. Since foreign currency buys more
dollars, they will likely invest in more U.S. assets.</p>
<p>At this point, you should have a good sense of the major players in
the foreign exchange market: firms involved in</p>

<p>Why is a stronger currency not necessarily better?</p>
<p>One common misunderstanding about exchange rates is that a
“stronger” or “appreciating” currency must be better than a “weaker”
or “depreciating” currency. After all, is it not obvious that
“strong” is better than “weak”? Do not let the terminology confuse
you. When a currency becomes stronger, so that it purchases more of
other currencies, it benefits some in the economy and injures
others. Stronger currency is not necessarily better, it is just
different.</p>

banks, and foreign exchange dealers. The next module shows how
players can use the tools of demand and supply in foreign exchange
markets to explain the underlying causes of stronger and weaker
currencies (we address “stronger” and “weaker” more in the following

market, almost all of the trading for Mexican pesos is for U.S. dollars.
What factors would cause the demand or supply to shift, thus leading to
a change in the equilibrium exchange rate? We discuss the answer to this
question in the following section.</span><span
id="bookmark1309">‌</span><span id="bookmark1310">‌</span></p>
<p>Expectations about Future Exchange Rates</p>
<p>One reason to demand a currency on the foreign exchange market is the
belief that the currency’s value is about to increase. One reason to
supply a currency—that is, sell it on the foreign exchange market—is the
expectation that the currency’s value is about to decline. For example,
imagine that a leading business newspaper, like the <em>Wall Street
Journal</em> or the <em>Financial
Times</em><a href="#bookmark1311" class="s34">, runs an article predicting that the Mexican peso will appreciate in value.</a>
<a href="#bookmark1311" class="a">Figure</a> <span class="s54">16.6
</span>illustrates the likely effects of such an article. Demand for the
Mexican peso shifts to the right, from D<span class="s60">0</span> to
D<span class="s60">1</span>, as investors become eager to purchase
pesos. Conversely, the supply of pesos shifts to the left, from S<span
class="s60">0</span> to S<span class="s60">1</span>, because investors
will be less willing to give them up. The result is that the equilibrium
exchange rate rises from 10 cents/peso to 12 cents/peso and the
equilibrium exchange rate rises from 85 billion to 90 billion pesos as
the equilibrium moves from E<span class="s60">0</span> to E<span
class="s60">1</span>.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_343.jpg" width="218" height="203" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark1311">Figure 16.6 Exchange Rate Market for Mexican
Peso Reacts to Expectations about Future Exchange Rates</span> <span
class="s37">An announcement that the peso exchange rate is likely to
strengthen in the future will lead to greater demand for the peso in the
present from investors who wish to benefit from the appreciation.
Similarly, it will make investors less likely to supply pesos to the
foreign exchange market. Both the shift of demand to the right and the
shift of supply to the left cause an immediate appreciation in the
exchange rate.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1311" id="bookmark1312" class="a">Figure 16.6</a>
<span class="p">also illustrates some peculiar traits of supply and
demand diagrams in the foreign exchange market. In contrast to all the
other cases of supply and demand you have considered, in the foreign
exchange market, supply and demand typically both move at the same time.
Groups of participants in the foreign exchange market like firms and
investors include some who are buyers and some who are sellers. An
expectation of a future shift in the exchange rate affects both buyers
and sellers—that is, it affects both demand and supply for a
currency.</span></p>
<p>The shifts in demand and supply curves both cause the exchange rate to
shift in the same direction. In this example, they both make the peso
exchange rate stronger. However, the shifts in demand and supply work in
opposing directions on the quantity traded. In this example, the rising
demand for pesos is causing the quantity to rise while the falling
supply of pesos is causing quantity to fall. In this specific example,
the result is a higher quantity. However, in other cases, the result
could be that quantity remains unchanged or declines.</p>
<p>This example also helps to explain why exchange rates often move quite
substantially in a short period of a few weeks or months. When investors
expect a country’s currency to strengthen in the future, they buy the
currency and cause it to appreciate immediately. The currency’s
appreciation can lead other investors to believe that future
appreciation is likely—and thus lead to even further appreciation.
Similarly, a fear that a currency <em>might</em> weaken quickly leads to an
<em>actual</em> weakening of the currency, which often reinforces the belief
that the currency will weaken further. Thus, beliefs about the future
path of exchange rates can be self-reinforcing, at least for a time, and
a large share of the trading in foreign exchange markets involves
dealers trying to outguess each other on what direction exchange rates
will move next.</p>
<p>Differences across Countries in Rates of Return</p>
<p>The motivation for investment, whether domestic or foreign, is to earn a
return. If rates of return in a country look relatively high, then that
country will tend to attract funds from abroad. Conversely, if rates of
return in a country look relatively low, then funds will tend to flee to
other economies. Changes in the expected rate of return will shift
demand and supply for a currency. For example, imagine that interest
rates rise in the United States as compared with Mexico. Thus, financial
investments in the United States promise a higher return than
previously. As a result, more investors will demand U.S. dollars so that
they can buy interest-bearing assets and fewer investors will be willing
to supply U.S. dollars to foreign exchange markets. Demand for the U.S.
dollar will shift to the right, from D<span class="s60">0</span> to
D<span class="s60">1</span>, and supply will shift to the left, from
S<span class="s60">0</span> to S<span
class="s60">1</span><a href="#bookmark1313" class="s34">, as</a>
<a href="#bookmark1313" class="a">Figure 16.7</a><span class="s54">
</span>shows. The new equilibrium (E<span class="s60">1</span>), will
occur at an exchange rate of nine pesos/dollar and the same quantity of
$8.5 billion. Thus, a higher interest rate or rate of return relative to
other countries leads a nation’s currency to appreciate or strengthen,
and a lower interest rate relative to other countries leads a nation’s
currency to depreciate or weaken. Since a nation’s central bank can use
monetary policy to affect its interest rates, a central bank can also
cause changes in exchange rates—a connection that we will discuss in
more detail later in this chapter.</p>

<p>Relative Inflation</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1314" class="s34">If a country experiences a relatively high inflation rate compared with other economies, then the buying power of its currency is eroding, which will tend to discourage anyone from wanting to acquire or to hold the currency.</a>

</span><a href="#bookmark1314" class="s34">shows an example based on an actual episode concerning the Mexican peso. In 1986–87, Mexico experienced an inflation rate of over 200%. Not surprisingly, as inflation dramatically decreased the peso’s purchasing power in Mexico. The peso’s exchange rate value declined as well.</a>
<a href="#bookmark1314" class="a">Figure 16.8</a><span class="s54">
</span>shows that the demand for the peso on foreign exchange markets
decreased from D<span class="s60">0</span> to D<span

experiencing relatively high inflation, then its buying power is

supply to increase from S<span class="s63">0</span> to S<span
class="s63">1</span>. Both movements in demand and supply would cause
the currency to depreciate. Here, we draw the effect on the quantity
traded as a decrease, but in truth it could be an increase or no change,
depending on the actual movements of demand and supply.</p>

<p>Purchasing Power Parity</p>
<p>Over the long term, exchange rates must bear some relationship to the
currency’s buying power in terms of internationally traded goods. If at
a certain exchange rate it was much cheaper to buy internationally
traded goods—such as oil, steel, computers, and cars—in one country than
in another country, businesses would start buying in the cheap country,
selling in other countries, and pocketing the profits.</p>
<p>For example, if a U.S. dollar is worth <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1.30 in Canadian currency, then
a car that sells for \)</span>20,000 in the United States should sell for
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(26,000 in Canada. If the price of cars in Canada were much lower than
\)</span>26,000, then at least some</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1315">U.S. car-buyers would convert their U.S. dollars
to Canadian dollars and buy their cars in Canada. If the price of cars
were much higher than $26,000 in this example, then at least some
Canadian buyers would convert their Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars and
go to the United States to purchase their cars. This is known as</span>
<strong>arbitrage</strong>, the process of buying and selling goods or currencies
across international borders at a profit. It may occur slowly, but over
time, it will force prices and exchange rates to align so that the price
of internationally traded goods is similar in all countries.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1316">We call the exchange rate that equalizes the
prices of internationally traded goods across countries the</span>
<strong>purchasing power parity (PPP)</strong> exchange rate. A group of economists
at the International Comparison Program, run by the World Bank, have
calculated the PPP exchange rate for all countries, based on detailed
studies of the prices and quantities of internationally tradable goods.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1317">The purchasing power parity exchange rate has
two functions. First, economists often use PPP exchange rates for
international comparison of GDP and other economic statistics. Imagine
that you are preparing a table showing the size of GDP in many countries
in several recent years, and for ease of comparison, you are converting
all the values into U.S. dollars. When you insert the value for Japan,
you need to use a yen/dollar exchange rate. However, should you use the
market exchange rate or the PPP exchange rate? Market exchange rates
bounce around. In 2014, the exchange rate was 105 yen/dollar, but in
late 2015 the U.S. dollar exchange rate versus the yen was 121
yen/dollar. For simplicity, say that Japan’s GDP was ¥500 trillion in
both 2014 and 2015. If you use the market exchange rates, then Japan’s
GDP will be <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(4.8 trillion in 2014 (that is, ¥500 trillion
/(¥105/dollar)) and \)</span>4.1 trillion in 2015 (that is,</span></p>
<p>¥500 trillion /(¥121/dollar)).</p>
<p>The misleading appearance of a changing Japanese economy occurs only
because we used the market exchange rate, which often has short-run
rises and falls. However, PPP exchange rates stay fairly constant and
change only modestly, if at all, from year to year.</p>
<p>The second function of PPP is that exchanges rates will often get closer
to it as time passes. It is true that in the short and medium run, as
exchange rates adjust to relative inflation rates, rates of return, and
to expectations about how interest rates and inflation will shift, the
exchange rates will often move away from the PPP exchange rate for a
time. However, knowing the PPP will allow you to track and predict
exchange rate relationships.</p>

Rates</span><span id="bookmark1318">‌</span></p>
<p>By the end of this section you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Explain how exchange rate shifting influences aggregate demand
and supply</p></li>
<li><p>Explain how shifting exchange rates also can influence loans and
banks</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1319">A central bank will be concerned about
the exchange rate for multiple reasons: (1) Movements in the
exchange rate will affect the quantity of aggregate demand in an
economy; (2) frequent substantial fluctuations in the exchange
rate can disrupt international trade and cause problems in a
nation’s banking system–this may contribute to an unsustainable
balance of trade and large inflows of international financial
capital, which can set up the economy for a deep recession if
international investors decide to move their money to another
country. Let’s discuss these scenarios in turn.</span></p>
<p>Exchange Rates, Aggregate Demand, and Aggregate Supply</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1320">Foreign trade in goods and services
typically involves incurring the costs of production in one
currency while receiving revenues from sales in another
currency. As a result, movements in exchange rates can have a
powerful effect on incentives to export and import, and thus on
aggregate demand in the economy as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark1321">For example, in 1999, when the euro
first became a currency, its value measured in U.S. currency was
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1.06/euro. By the end of 2013, the euro had risen (and the U.S.
dollar had correspondingly weakened) to \)</span>1.37/euro. However, by
the end of February, 2017, the exchange rate was once again
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1.06/euro. Consider the situation of a French firm that each
year incurs €10 million in costs, and sells its products in the
United States for \)</span>10 million. In 1999, when this firm converted
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10 million back to euros at the exchange rate of \)</span>1.06/euro
(that is, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10 million × \[€1/\)</span>1.06]), it received €9.4 million,
and suffered a loss. In 2013, when this same firm converted <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10
million back to euros at the exchange rate of \)</span>1.37/euro (that
is, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10 million × \[€1 euro/\)</span>1.37]), it received approximately
€7.3 million and an even larger loss. In the beginning of 2017,
with the exchange rate back at $1.06/euro the firm would suffer
a loss once again. This example shows how a stronger euro
discourages exports by the French firm, because it makes the
costs of production in the domestic currency higher relative to
the sales revenues earned in another country. From the point of
view of the U.S. economy, the example also shows how a weaker
U.S. dollar encourages exports.</span></p>
<p>Since an increase in exports results in more dollars flowing
into the economy, and an increase in imports means more dollars
are flowing out, it is easy to conclude that exports are “good”
for the economy and imports are “bad,” but this overlooks the
role of exchange rates. If an American consumer buys a Japanese
car for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(20,000 instead of an American car for \)</span>30,000, it may
be tempting to argue that the American economy has lost out.
However, the Japanese company will have to convert those dollars
to yen to pay its workers and operate its factories. Whoever
buys those dollars will have to use them to purchase American
goods and services, so the money comes right back into the
American economy. At the same time, the consumer saves money by
buying a less expensive import, and can use the extra money for
other purposes.</p>
<p>Fluctuations in Exchange Rates</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1322" class="s34">Exchange rates can fluctuate a great deal in the short run. As yet one more example, the Indian rupee moved from 39 rupees/dollar in February 2008 to 51 rupees/dollar in March 2009, a decline of more than one-fourth in the value of the rupee on foreign exchange markets.</a>
<a href="#bookmark1322" class="a">Figure 16.9</a> <span
class="p">earlier showed that even two economically developed
neighboring economies like the United States and Canada can see
significant movements in exchange rates over a few years. For
firms that depend on export sales, or firms that rely on
imported inputs to production, or even purely domestic firms
that compete with firms tied into international trade—which in
many countries adds up to half or more of a nation’s GDP—sharp
movements in exchange rates can lead to dramatic changes in
profits and losses. A central bank may desire to keep exchange
rates from moving too much as part of providing a stable
business climate, where firms can focus on productivity and
innovation, not on reacting to exchange rate
fluctuations.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1322" class="s34">One of the most economically destructive effects of exchange rate fluctuations can happen through the banking system. Financial institutions measure most international loans are measured in a few large currencies, like U.S. dollars, European euros, and Japanese yen. In countries that do not use these currencies, banks often borrow funds in the currencies of other countries, like U.S. dollars, but then lend in their own domestic currency. The left-hand chain of events in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1322" class="a">Figure 16.9</a> <span
class="p">shows how this pattern of international borrowing can
work. A bank in Thailand borrows one million in U.S. dollars.
Then the bank converts the dollars to its domestic currency—in
the case of Thailand, the</span></p>
<p>currency is the baht—at a rate of 40 baht/dollar. The bank then
lends the baht to a firm in Thailand. The business repays the
loan in baht, and the bank converts it back to U.S. dollars to
pay off its original U.S. dollar loan.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_347.jpg" width="448" height="507" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark1322">Figure 16.9 International
Borrowing</span> <span class="s37">The scenario of international
borrowing that ends on the left is a success story, but the
scenario that ends on the right shows what happens when the
exchange rate weakens.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1322" class="s34">This process of borrowing in a foreign currency and lending in a domestic currency can work just fine, as long as the exchange rate does not shift. In the scenario outlined, if the dollar strengthens and the baht weakens, a problem arises. The right-hand chain of events in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1322" class="a">Figure 16.9</a> <span
class="p">illustrates what happens when the baht unexpectedly
weakens from 40 baht/dollar to 50 baht/dollar. The Thai firm
still repays the loan in full to the bank. However, because of
the shift in the exchange rate, the bank cannot repay its loan
in U.S. dollars. (Of course, if the exchange rate had changed in
the other direction, making the Thai currency stronger, the bank
could have realized an unexpectedly large profit.)</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark1323">In 1997–1998, countries across eastern
Asia, like Thailand, Korea, Malaysia, and Indonesia, experienced
a sharp depreciation of their currencies, in some cases 50% or
more. These countries had been experiencing substantial inflows
of foreign investment capital, with bank lending increasing by
20% to 30% per year through the mid-1990s. When their exchange
rates depreciated, the banking systems in these countries were
bankrupt. Argentina experienced a similar chain of events
in 2002. When the Argentine peso depreciated, Argentina’s banks
found themselves unable to pay back what they had borrowed in
U.S. dollars.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark1324">Banks play a vital role in any economy
in facilitating transactions and in making loans to firms and
consumers. When most of a country’s largest banks become
bankrupt simultaneously, a sharp decline in aggregate demand and
a deep recession results. Since the main responsibilities of a
central bank are to control the money supply and to ensure that
the banking system is stable, a central bank must be concerned
about whether large and unexpected exchange rate depreciation
will drive most of the country’s existing banks into bankruptcy.
For more on this concern, return to the</span></p>
<p>chapter on <span class="s54">The International Trade and Capital
Flows</span>.</p>
<p>Summing Up Public Policy and Exchange Rates</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1325">Every nation would prefer a stable
exchange rate to facilitate international trade and reduce the
degree of risk and uncertainty in the economy. However, a nation
may sometimes want a weaker exchange rate to stimulate aggregate
demand and reduce a recession, or a stronger exchange rate to
fight inflation. The country must also be concerned that rapid
movements from a weak to a strong exchange rate may cripple its
export industries, while rapid movements from a strong to a weak
exchange rate can cripple its banking sector. In short, every
choice of an exchange rate—whether it should be stronger or
weaker, or fixed or changing—represents potential
tradeoffs.</span></p>

exchange rate policy and its tradeoffs.</span></p>

<p><span id="bookmark1327">Figure 16.10 A Spectrum of Exchange Rate
Policies</span> <span class="s37">A nation may adopt one of a variety of
exchange rate regimes, from floating rates in which the foreign exchange
market determines the rates to pegged rates where governments intervene
to manage the exchange rate’s value, to a common currency where the
nation adopts another country or group of countries’ currency.</span></p>
<p>Floating Exchange Rates</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1328">We refer to a policy which allows the foreign
exchange market to set exchange rates as a</span> <strong>floating exchange
rate</strong>. The</p>
<p>U.S. dollar is a floating exchange rate, as are the currencies of about
40% of the countries in the world economy. The major concern with this
policy is that exchange rates can move a great deal in a short time.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1329" class="s34">Consider the U.S. exchange rate expressed in terms of another fairly stable currency, the Japanese yen, as</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark1329">Figure</a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1329" class="a">16.11</a> <span class="p">shows. On
January 1, 2002, the exchange rate was 133 yen/dollar. On January 1,
2005, it was 103 yen/dollar. On June 1, 2007, it was 122 yen/dollar, on
January 1, 2012, it was 77 yen per dollar, and on March 1, 2015, it was
120 yen per dollar. As investor sentiment swings back and forth, driving
exchange rates up and down, exporters, importers, and banks involved in
international lending are all affected. At worst, large movements in
exchange rates can drive companies into bankruptcy or trigger a
nationwide banking collapse. However, even in the moderate case of the
yen/dollar exchange rate, these movements of roughly 30 percent back and
forth impose stress on both economies as firms must alter their export
and import plans to take the new exchange rates into account. Especially
in smaller countries where international trade is a relatively large
share of GDP, exchange rate movements can rattle their economies.</span></p>

<p><span id="bookmark1329">Figure 16.11 U.S. Dollar Exchange Rate in
Japanese Yen</span> <span class="s37">Even seemingly stable exchange
rates such as the Japanese Yen to the U.S. Dollar can vary when closely
examined over time. This figure shows a relatively stable rate between
2011 and 2013. In 2013, there was a drastic depreciation of the Yen
(relative to the U.S. Dollar) by about 14% and again at the end of the
year in 2014 also by about 14%. (Source: Federal Reserve Economic Data

id="bookmark1330">‌</span></p>
<p>However, movements of floating exchange rates have advantages, too.
After all, prices of goods and services rise and fall throughout a
market economy, as demand and supply shift. If an economy experiences
strong inflows or outflows of international financial capital, or has
relatively high inflation, or if it experiences strong productivity
growth so that purchasing power changes relative to other economies,
then it makes economic sense for the exchange rate to shift as well.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1331">Floating exchange rate advocates often argue
that if government policies were more predictable and stable, then
inflation rates and interest rates would be more predictable and stable.
Exchange rates would bounce around less, too. The economist Milton
Friedman (1912–2006), for example, wrote a defense of floating exchange
rates in 1962 in his book</span> <em>Capitalism and Freedom</em>:</p>
<p>Being in favor of floating exchange rates does not mean being in favor
of unstable exchange rates. When we support a free price system [for
goods and services] at home, this does not imply that we favor a system
in which prices fluctuate wildly up and down. What we want is a system
in which prices are free to fluctuate but in which the forces
determining them are sufficiently stable so that in fact prices move
within moderate ranges. This is equally true in a system of floating
exchange rates. The ultimate objective is a world in which exchange
rates, while free to vary, are, in fact, highly stable because basic
economic policies and conditions are stable.</p>
<p>Advocates of floating exchange rates admit that, yes, exchange rates may
sometimes fluctuate. They point out, however, that if a central bank
focuses on preventing either high inflation or deep recession, with low
and reasonably steady interest rates, then exchange rates will have less
reason to vary.</p>
<p>Using Soft Pegs and Hard Pegs</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1332">When a government intervenes in the foreign
exchange market so that the currency’s exchange rate is different from
what the market would have produced, it establishes a “peg” for its
currency. A</span> <strong>soft peg</strong> is the name for an exchange rate policy
where the government usually allows the market to set exchange rate, but
in some cases, especially if the exchange rate seems to be moving
rapidly in one direction, the central bank will intervene in the market.
With a <strong>hard peg</strong> exchange rate policy, the central bank sets a fixed
and unchanging value for the exchange rate. A central bank can implement
soft peg and hard peg policies.<span id="bookmark1333">‌</span></p>
<p><span class="p">Suppose the market exchange rate for the Brazilian
currency, the real, would be 35 cents/real with a daily quantity of 15
billion real traded in the market, as the equilibrium E</span><span
class="s60">0</span> <a href="#bookmark1334" class="s34">in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1334" class="a">Figure 16.12</a>
<a href="#bookmark1334" class="s34">(a) and</a>
<a href="#bookmark1334" class="a">Figure 16.12</a>
<a href="#bookmark1334" class="s34">(b) show. However, Brazil’s government decides that the exchange rate should be 30 cents/real, as</a>
<a href="#bookmark1334" class="a">Figure 16.12</a> <span class="p">(a)
shows. Perhaps</span></p>
<p>Brazil sets this lower exchange rate to benefit its export industries.
Perhaps it is an attempt to stimulate aggregate demand by stimulating
exports. Perhaps Brazil believes that the current market exchange rate
is higher than the long- term purchasing power parity value of the real,
so it is minimizing fluctuations in the real by keeping it at this lower
rate. Perhaps the government set the target exchange rate sometime in
the past, and it is now maintaining it for the sake of stability.
Whatever the reason, if Brazil’s central bank wishes to keep the
exchange rate below the market level, it must face the reality that at
this weaker exchange rate of 30 cents/real, the quantity demanded of its
currency at 17 billion reals is greater than the quantity supplied of 13
billion reals in the foreign exchange market.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_350.jpg" width="506" height="250" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark1334">Figure 16.12 Pegging an Exchange Rate</span>
<span class="s37">(a) If an exchange rate is pegged below what would
otherwise be the equilibrium, then the currency’s quantity demanded will
exceed the quantity supplied. (b) If an exchange rate is pegged above
what would otherwise be the equilibrium, then the currency’s quantity
supplied exceeds the quantity demanded.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark1335">The Brazilian central bank could weaken its
exchange rate in two ways. One approach is to use an expansionary
monetary policy that leads to lower interest rates. In foreign exchange
markets, the lower interest rates will reduce demand and increase supply
of the real and lead to depreciation. Central banks do not use this
technique often because lowering interest rates to weaken the currency
may be in conflict with the country’s monetary policy goals.
Alternatively, Brazil’s central bank could trade directly in the foreign
exchange market. The central bank can expand the money supply by
creating reals, use the reals to purchase foreign currencies, and avoid
selling any of its own currency. In this way, it can fill the gap
between quantity demanded and quantity supplied of its
currency.</span><span id="bookmark1336">‌</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1334" class="a">Figure 16.12</a> <span class="p">(b)
shows the opposite situation. Here, the Brazilian government desires a
stronger exchange rate of 40 cents/real than the market rate of 35
cents/real. Perhaps Brazil desires the stronger currency to reduce
aggregate demand and to fight inflation, or perhaps Brazil believes that
that current market exchange rate is temporarily lower than the
long-term rate. Whatever the reason, at the higher desired exchange
rate, the quantity supplied of 16 billion reals exceeds the quantity
demanded of 14 billion reals.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark1337">Brazil’s central bank can use a contractionary
monetary policy to raise interest rates, which will increase demand and
reduce currency supply on foreign exchange markets, and lead to an
appreciation. Alternatively, Brazil’s central bank can trade directly in
the foreign exchange market. In this case, with an excess supply of its
own currency in foreign exchange markets, the central bank must use
reserves of foreign currency, like U.S. dollars, to demand its own
currency and thus cause an appreciation of its exchange rate.</span></p>
<p>Both a soft peg and a hard peg policy require that the central bank
intervene in the foreign exchange market. However, a hard peg policy
attempts to preserve a fixed exchange rate at all times. A soft peg
policy typically allows the exchange rate to move up and down by
relatively small amounts in the short run of several months or a year,
and to move by larger amounts over time, but seeks to avoid extreme
short-term fluctuations.</p>
<p>Tradeoffs of Soft Pegs and Hard Pegs</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1338">When a country decides to alter the market
exchange rate, it faces a number of tradeoffs. If it uses monetary
policy to alter the exchange rate, it then cannot at the same time use
monetary policy to address issues of inflation or recession. If it uses
direct purchases and sales of foreign currencies in exchange rates, then
it must face the issue of how it will</span></p>
<p>handle its reserves of foreign currency. Finally, a pegged exchange rate
can even create additional movements of the exchange rate. For example,
even the possibility of government intervention in exchange rate markets
will lead to rumors about whether and when the government will
intervene, and dealers in the foreign exchange market will react to
those rumors. Let’s consider these issues in turn.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1339">One concern with pegged exchange rate policies
is that they imply a country’s monetary policy is no longer focused on
controlling inflation or shortening recessions, but now must also take
the exchange rate into account. For example, when a country pegs its
exchange rate, it will sometimes face economic situations where it would
like to have an expansionary monetary policy to fight recession—but it
cannot do so because that policy would depreciate its exchange rate and
break its hard peg. With a soft peg exchange rate policy, the central
bank can sometimes ignore the exchange rate and focus on domestic
inflation or recession—but in other cases the central bank may ignore
inflation or recession and instead focus on its soft peg exchange rate.
With a hard peg policy, domestic monetary policy is effectively no
longer determined by domestic inflation or unemployment, but only by
what monetary policy is needed to keep the exchange rate at the hard
peg.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark1340">Another issue arises when a central bank
intervenes directly in the exchange rate market. If a central bank ends
up in a situation where it is perpetually creating and selling its own
currency on foreign exchange markets, it will be buying the currency of
other countries, like U.S. dollars or euros, to hold as reserves.
Holding large reserves of other currencies has an opportunity cost, and
central banks will not wish to boost such reserves without
limit.</span><span id="bookmark1341">‌</span></p>
<p>In addition, a central bank that causes a large increase in the supply
of money is also risking an inflationary surge in aggregate demand.
Conversely, when a central bank wishes to buy its own currency, it can
do so by using its reserves of international currency like the U.S.
dollar or the euro. However, if the central bank runs out of such
reserves, it can no longer use this method to strengthen its currency.
Thus, buying foreign currencies in exchange rate markets can be
expensive and inflationary, while selling foreign currencies can work
only until a central bank runs out of reserves.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_351.png" width="624" height="51" alt="image" />
<p>How do Tobin taxes control the flow of capital?</p>
<p>Some countries like Chile and Malaysia have sought to reduce movements
in exchange rates by limiting international financial capital inflows
and outflows. The government can enact this policy either through
targeted taxes or by regulations.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1343">Taxes on international capital flows are
sometimes known as</span> <strong>Tobin taxes</strong>, named after James Tobin, the
1981 Nobel laureate in economics who proposed such a tax in a 1972
lecture. For example, a government might tax all foreign exchange
transactions, or attempt to tax short-term portfolio investment while
exempting long-term foreign direct investment. Countries can also use
regulation to forbid certain kinds of foreign investment in the first
place or to make it difficult for international financial investors to
withdraw their funds from a country.<span
id="bookmark1344">‌</span><span id="bookmark1345">‌</span></p>
<p>The goal of such policies is to reduce international capital flows,
especially short-term portfolio flows, in the hope that doing so will
reduce the chance of large movements in exchange rates that can bring
macroeconomic disaster.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1346">However, proposals to limit international
financial flows have severe practical difficulties. National governments
impose taxes, not international ones. If one government imposes a Tobin
tax on exchange rate transactions carried out within its territory, a
firm based someplace like the Grand Caymans, an island nation in the
Caribbean well-known for allowing some financial wheeling and dealing
might easily operate the exchange rate market. In an interconnected
global economy, if goods and services are allowed to flow across
national</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark1342">Yet another issue is that when a government pegs
its exchange rate, it may unintentionally create another reason for
additional fluctuation. With a soft peg policy, foreign exchange dealers
and international investors react to every rumor about how or when the
central bank is likely to intervene to influence the exchange rate, and
as they react to rumors the exchange rate will shift up and down. Thus,
even though the goal of a soft peg policy is to reduce short-term
fluctuations of the exchange rate, the existence of the policy—when
anticipated in the foreign exchange market—may sometimes increase
short-term fluctuations as international investors try to anticipate how
and when the central bank will act. The following Clear It Up feature
discusses the effects of</span> <strong>international capital flows</strong>—capital
that flows across national boundaries as either portfolio investment or
direct investment.</p>
<p>borders, then payments need to flow across borders, too. It is very
difficult—in fact close to impossible—for a nation to allow only the
flows of payments that relate to goods and services, while clamping down
or taxing other flows of financial capital. If a nation participates in
international trade, it must also participate in international capital
movements.</p>
<p>Finally, countries all over the world, especially low-income countries,
are crying out for foreign investment to help develop their economies.
Policies that discourage international financial investment may prevent
some possible harm, but they rule out potentially substantial economic
benefits as well.</p>
<p>A hard peg exchange rate policy will not allow short-term fluctuations
in the exchange rate. If the government first announces a hard peg and
then later changes its mind—perhaps the government becomes unwilling to
keep interest rates high or to hold high levels of foreign exchange
reserves—then the result of abandoning a hard peg could be a dramatic
shift in the exchange rate.</p>
<p>In the mid-2000s, about one-third of the countries in the world used a
soft peg approach and about one-quarter used a hard peg approach. The
general trend in the 1990s was to shift away from a soft peg approach in
favor of either floating rates or a hard peg. The concern is that a
successful soft peg policy may, for a time, lead to very little
variation in exchange rates, so that firms and banks in the economy
begin to act as if a hard peg exists. When the exchange rate does move,
the effects are especially painful because firms and banks have not
planned and hedged against a possible change. Thus, the argument went,
it is better either to be clear that the exchange rate is always
flexible, or that it is fixed, but choosing an in-between soft peg
option may end up being worst of all.</p>
<p>A Merged Currency</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1347">A final approach to exchange rate policy is for
a nation to choose a common currency shared with one or more nations is
also called a</span> <strong>merged currency</strong>. A merged currency approach
eliminates foreign exchange risk altogether. Just as no one worries
about exchange rate movements when buying and selling between New York
and California, Europeans know that the value of the euro will be the
same in Germany and France and other European nations that have adopted
the euro.</p>
<p>However, a merged currency also poses problems. Like a hard peg, a
merged currency means that a nation has given up altogether on domestic
monetary policy, and instead has put its interest rate policies in other
hands. When Ecuador uses the U.S. dollar as its currency, it has no
voice in whether the Federal Reserve raises or lowers interest rates.
The European Central Bank that determines monetary policy for the euro
has representatives from all the euro nations. However, from the
standpoint of, say, Portugal, there will be times when the decisions of
the European Central Bank about monetary policy do not match the
decisions that a Portuguese central bank would have made.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1348" class="s34">The lines between these four different exchange rate policies can blend into each other. For example, a soft peg exchange rate policy in which the government almost never acts to intervene in the exchange rate market will look a great deal like a floating exchange rate. Conversely, a soft peg policy in which the government intervenes often to keep the exchange rate near a specific level will look a lot like a hard peg. A decision to merge currencies with another country is, in effect, a decision to have a permanently fixed exchange rate with those countries, which is like a very hard exchange rate peg.</a>

<p>Table 16.3 Tradeoffs of Exchange Rate Policies</p>
<p>Global macroeconomics would be easier if the whole world had one
currency and one central bank. The exchange rates between different
currencies complicate the picture. If financial markets solely set
exchange rates, they fluctuate substantially as short-term portfolio
investors try to anticipate tomorrow’s news. If the government attempts
to intervene in exchange rate markets through soft pegs or hard pegs, it
gives up at least some of the power to use monetary policy to focus on
domestic inflations and recessions, and it risks causing even greater
fluctuations in foreign exchange markets.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1349">There is no consensus among economists about
which exchange rate policies are best: floating, soft peg, hard peg, or
merged currencies. The choice depends both on how well a nation’s
central bank can implement a specific exchange rate policy and on how
well a nation’s firms and banks can adapt to different exchange rate
policies. A national economy that does a fairly good job at achieving
the four main economic goals of growth, low inflation, low unemployment,
and a sustainable balance of trade will probably do just fine most of
the time with any exchange rate policy. Conversely, no exchange rate
policy is likely to save an economy that consistently fails at achieving
these goals. Alternatively, a merged currency applied across wide
geographic and cultural areas carries with it its own set of problems,
such as the ability for countries to conduct their own independent
monetary policies.</span></p>

<p>Is a Stronger Dollar Good for the U.S. Economy?</p>
<p>The foreign exchange value of the dollar is a price and whether a higher
price is good or bad depends on where you are standing: sellers benefit
from higher prices and buyers are harmed. A stronger dollar is good for
U.S. imports (and people working for U.S. importers) and U.S. investment
abroad. It is also good for U.S. tourists going to other countries,
since their dollar goes further. However, a stronger dollar is bad for
U.S. exports (and people working in U.S. export industries); it is bad
for foreign investment in the United States (leading, for example, to
higher U.S. interest rates); and it is bad for foreign tourists (as well
as U.S hotels, restaurants, and others in the tourist industry). In
short, whether the U.S. dollar is good or bad is a more complex question
than you may have thought. The economic answer is “it depends.”</p>

<p>KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY</p>
<ol>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark1288" class="a">How the Foreign Exchange Market</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark1288">Works</a></p>
<p>In the foreign exchange market, people and firms exchange one
currency to purchase another currency. The demand for dollars comes
from those U.S. export firms seeking to convert their earnings in
foreign currency back into U.S. dollars; foreign tourists converting
their earnings in a foreign currency back into U.S. dollars; and
foreign investors seeking to make financial investments in the U.S.
economy. On the supply side of the foreign exchange market for the
trading of U.S. dollars are foreign firms that have sold imports in
the U.S. economy and are seeking to convert their earnings back to
their home currency; U.S. tourists abroad; and U.S. investors
seeking to make financial investments in foreign economies. When
currency A can buy more of currency B, then currency A has
strengthened or appreciated relative to B. When currency A can buy
less of currency B, then currency A has weakened or depreciated
relative to B. If currency A strengthens or appreciates relative to
currency B, then currency B must necessarily weaken or depreciate
with regard to currency A. A stronger currency benefits those who
are buying with that currency and injures those who are selling. A
weaker currency injures those, like importers, who are buying with
that currency and benefits those who are selling with it, like
exporters.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark1306" class="a">Demand and Supply Shifts in Foreign Exchange</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark1306">Markets</a></p>
<p>In the extreme short run, ranging from a few minutes to a few weeks,
speculators who are trying to invest in currencies that will grow
stronger, and to sell currencies that will grow weaker influence
exchange rates. Such speculation can create a self-fulfilling
prophecy, at least for a time, where an expected appreciation leads
to a stronger currency and vice versa. In the relatively short run,
differences in rates of return influence exchange rate markets.
Countries with relatively high real rates of return (for example,
high interest rates) will tend to experience stronger currencies as
they attract money from abroad, while countries with relatively low
rates of return will tend to experience weaker exchange rates as
investors convert to other currencies.</p>
<p>In the medium run of a few months or a few years, inflation rates
influence exchange rate markets. Countries with relatively high
inflation will tend to experience less demand for their currency
than countries with lower inflation, and thus currency depreciation.
Over long periods of many years, exchange rates tend to adjust
toward the purchasing power parity (PPP) rate, which is the exchange
rate such that the prices of internationally tradable goods in
different countries, when converted at the PPP exchange rate to a
common currency, are similar in all economies.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark1318" class="a">Macroeconomic Effects of Exchange</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark1318">Rates</a></p>
<p>A central bank will be concerned about the exchange rate for several
reasons. Exchange rates will affect imports and exports, and thus
affect aggregate demand in the economy. Fluctuations in exchange
rates may cause difficulties for many firms, but especially banks.
The exchange rate may accompany unsustainable flows of international
financial capital.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark1326" class="a">Exchange Rate</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark1326">Policies</a></p></li>
</ol>
<p>In a floating exchange rate policy, a government determines its
country’s exchange rate in the foreign exchange market. In a soft peg
exchange rate policy, the foreign exchange market usually determines a
country’s exchange rate, but the government sometimes intervenes to
strengthen or weaken it. In a hard peg exchange rate policy, the
government chooses an exchange rate. A central bank can intervene in
exchange markets in two ways. It can raise or lower interest rates to
make the currency stronger or weaker. It also can directly purchase or
sell its currency in foreign exchange markets. All exchange rates
policies face tradeoffs. A hard peg exchange rate policy will reduce
exchange rate fluctuations, but means that a country must focus its
monetary policy on the exchange rate, not on fighting recession or
controlling inflation. When a nation merges its currency with another
nation, it gives up on nationally oriented monetary policy altogether.</p>
<p>A soft peg exchange rate may create additional volatility as exchange
rate markets try to anticipate when and how the government will
intervene. A flexible exchange rate policy allows monetary policy to
focus on inflation and unemployment, and allows the exchange rate to
change with inflation and rates of return, but also raises a risk that
exchange rates may sometimes make large and abrupt movements. The
spectrum of exchange rate policies includes:</p>
<p>(a) a floating exchange rate, (b) a pegged exchange rate, soft or
hard, and (c) a merged currency. Monetary policy can focus on a variety
of goals: (a) inflation; (b) inflation or unemployment, depending on
which is the most dangerous obstacle; and (c) a long-term rule based
policy designed to keep the money supply stable and predictable.</p>

<p>No Yellowstone Park?</p>
<p>You had trekked all the way to see Yellowstone National Park in the
beautiful month of October 2013, only to find it… closed. Closed! Why?</p>
<p>For two weeks in October 2013, the U.S. federal government shut down.
Many federal services, like the national parks, closed and 800,000
federal employees were furloughed. Tourists were shocked and so was the
rest of the world: Congress and the President could not agree on a
budget. Inside the Capitol, Republicans and Democrats argued about
spending priorities and whether to increase the national debt limit.
Each year’s budget, which is over $3 trillion of spending, must be
approved by Congress and signed by the President. Two thirds of the
budget are entitlements and other mandatory spending which occur without
congressional or presidential action once the programs are established.
Tied to the budget debate was the issue of increasing the debt
ceiling—how high the U.S. government’s national debt can be. The House
of Representatives refused to sign on to the bills to fund the
government unless they included provisions to stop or change the
Affordable Health Care Act (more colloquially known as Obamacare). As
the days progressed, the United States came very close to defaulting on
its debt.</p>
<p>Why does the federal budget create such intense debates? What would
happen if the United States actually defaulted on its debt? In this
chapter, we will examine the federal budget, taxation, and fiscal
policy. We will also look at the annual federal budget deficits and the
national debt.</p>

<p>All levels of government—federal, state, and local—have budgets that
show how much revenue the government expects to receive in taxes and
other income and how the government plans to spend it. Budgets, however,
can shift dramatically within a few years, as policy decisions and
unexpected events disrupt earlier tax and spending plans.</p>

class="p">Fiscal policy is one of two policy tools for fine tuning the
economy (the other is monetary policy). While policymakers at the
Federal Reserve make monetary policy, Congress and the President make
fiscal policy.</span></p>
<p>The discussion of fiscal policy focuses on how federal government taxing
and spending affects aggregate demand. All government spending and taxes
affect the economy, but fiscal policy focuses strictly on federal
government policies. We begin with an overview of U.S. government
spending and taxes. We then discuss fiscal policy from a short-run
perspective; that is, how government uses tax and spending policies to
address recession, unemployment, and inflation; how periods of recession
and growth affect government budgets; and the merits of balanced budget
proposals.</p>

spending and taxes are equal, it has a <strong>balanced budget</strong>. For
example, in 2009, the U.S. government experienced its largest budget
deficit ever, as the federal government spent $1.4 trillion more

Comparing spending over time in nominal dollars is misleading

Security and healthcare have grown steadily as a percent of GDP.
Healthcare expenditures include both payments for senior citizens
(Medicare), and payments for low-income Americans (Medicaid). State
governments also partially fund Medicaid. Interest payments are the
final main category of government spending in Figure 30.2.</p>

<p>Each year, the government borrows funds from U.S. citizens and
foreigners to cover its budget deficits. It does this by selling
securities (Treasury bonds, notes, and bills)—in essence borrowing
from the public and promising to repay with interest in the future.
From 1961 to 1997, the U.S. government has run budget deficits, and
thus borrowed funds, in almost every year. It had budget surpluses
from 1998 to 2001, and then returned to deficits.</p>
<p>The interest payments on past federal government borrowing were
typically 1–2% of GDP in the 1960s and 1970s but then climbed above
3% of GDP in the 1980s and stayed there until the late 1990s. The
government was able to repay some of its past borrowing by running
surpluses from 1998 to 2001 and, with help from low interest rates,
the interest payments on past federal government borrowing had
fallen back to 1.4% of GDP by 2012.</p>
<p>We investigate the government borrowing and debt patterns in more
detail later in this chapter, but first we need to clarify the
difference between the deficit and the debt. <em>The deficit is not the
debt</em>. The difference between the deficit and the debt lies in the
time frame. The government deficit (or surplus) refers to what
happens with the federal government budget each year. The government
debt is accumulated over time. It is the sum of all past deficits
and surpluses. If you borrow <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10,000 per year for each of the four
years of college, you might say that your annual deficit was
\)</span>10,000, but your accumulated debt over the four years is $40,000.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1391" class="s34">These four categories—national defense, Social Security, healthcare, and interest payments—account for roughly 73% of all federal spending, as</a>

Vermont) have balanced budget laws, which means any gaps between
revenues and spending must be closed by higher taxes, lower
spending, drawing down their previous savings, or some combination
of all of these.</span></p>

<p>U.S. presidential candidates often run for office pledging to
improve the public schools or to get tough on crime. However, in the
U.S. government system, these tasks are primarily state and local

</ul>
<p>There are two main categories of taxes: those that the federal
government collects and those that the state and local governments
collect. What percentage the government collects and for what it
uses that revenue varies greatly. The following sections will
briefly explain the taxation system in the United States.</p>
<p>Federal Taxes</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1394" class="s34">Just as many Americans erroneously think that federal spending has grown considerably, many also believe that taxes have increased substantially. The top line of</a>
<a href="#bookmark1394" class="a">Figure 17.5</a> <span
class="p">shows total federal taxes as a share of GDP since 1960.

substantially below this level, due to recession.</span></p>

<p><span id="bookmark1394"><span class="s36">Figure 17.5 Federal Taxes,
1960–2014 </span></span>Federal tax revenues have been about 17–20%
of GDP during most periods in recent decades. The primary sources of
federal taxes are individual income taxes and the payroll taxes that
finance Social Security and Medicare. Corporate income taxes and
social insurance taxes provide smaller shares of revenue. (Source:

<p><a href="#bookmark1394" id="bookmark1395" class="a">Figure 17.5</a><span
class="s54"> </span>also shows the taxation patterns for the main
categories that the federal government taxes: individual income
taxes, corporate income taxes, and social insurance and retirement
receipts. When most people think of federal government taxes, the
first tax that comes to mind is the <strong>individual income tax</strong> that
is due every year on April 15 (or the first business day after). The
personal income tax is the largest single source of federal
government revenue, but it still represents less than half of
federal tax revenue.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1396">The second largest source of federal revenue
is the</span> <strong>payroll tax</strong> (captured in social insurance and
retirement receipts), which provides funds for Social Security and
Medicare. Payroll taxes have increased steadily over time. Together,
the personal income tax and the payroll tax accounted for about 80%
of federal tax revenues in 2014. Although personal income tax
revenues account for more total revenue than the payroll tax, nearly
three-quarters of households pay more in payroll taxes than in
income taxes.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1397">The income tax is a</span> <strong>progressive
tax</strong>, which means that the tax rates increase as a household’s
income increases. Taxes</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_359.png" width="624" height="51" alt="image" />
<p>How does the marginal rate work?</p>
<p>Suppose that a single taxpayer’s income is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(35,000 per year. Also
suppose that income from \)</span>0 to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(9,075 is taxed at 10%, income from
\)</span>9,075 to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(36,900 is taxed at 15%, and, finally, income from \)</span>36,900
and beyond is taxed at 25%. Since this person earns $35,000, their
marginal tax rate is 15%.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1398">also vary with marital status, family size,
and other factors. The</span> <strong>marginal tax rates</strong> (the tax due on
all yearly income) for a single taxpayer range from 10% to 35%,
depending on income, as the following Clear It Up feature explains.</p>
<p>The key fact here is that the federal income tax is designed so that
tax rates increase as income increases, up to a certain level. The
payroll taxes that support Social Security and Medicare are designed
in a different way. First, the payroll taxes for Social Security are
imposed at a rate of 12.4% up to a certain wage limit, set at
$118,500 in 2015. Medicare, on the other hand, pays for elderly
healthcare, and is fixed at 2.9%, with no upper ceiling.</p>
<p>In both cases, the employer and the employee split the payroll
taxes. An employee only sees 6.2% deducted from his or her paycheck
for Social Security, and 1.45% from Medicare. However, as economists
are quick to point out, the employer’s half of the taxes are
probably passed along to the employees in the form of lower wages,
so in reality, the worker pays all of the payroll taxes.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1399">We also call the Medicare payroll tax
a</span> <strong>proportional tax</strong>; that is, a flat percentage of all
wages earned. The Social Security payroll tax is proportional up to
the wage limit, but above that level it becomes a <strong>regressive
tax</strong>, meaning that people with higher incomes pay a smaller share
of their income in tax.<span id="bookmark1400">‌</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1394" id="bookmark1401" class="s34">The third-largest source of federal tax revenue, as</a>
<a href="#bookmark1394" class="a">Figure 17.5</a><span class="s54">
</span>shows is the <strong>corporate income tax</strong>. The common name for
corporate income is “profits.” Over time, corporate income tax
receipts have declined as a share of GDP, from about 4% in the 1960s
to an average of 1% to 2% of GDP in the first decade of the 2000s.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1402">The federal government has a few other,
smaller sources of revenue. It imposes an</span> <strong>excise tax</strong>—that
is, a tax on a particular good—on gasoline, tobacco, and alcohol. As
a share of GDP, the amount the government collects from these taxes
has stayed nearly constant over time, from about 2% of GDP in the
1960s to roughly 3% by 2014, according to the nonpartisan
Congressional Budget Office. The government also imposes an <strong>estate
and gift tax</strong> on people who pass large amounts of assets to the
next generation—either after death or during life in the form of
gifts. These estate and gift taxes collected about 0.2% of GDP in
the first decade of the 2000s. By a quirk of legislation, the
government repealed the estate and gift tax in 2010, but reinstated
it in 2011. Other federal taxes, which are also relatively small in
magnitude, include tariffs the government collects on imported goods
and charges for inspections of goods entering the country.<span
id="bookmark1403">‌</span></p>
<p>State and Local Taxes</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1404" class="s34">At the state and local level, taxes have been rising as a share of GDP over the last few decades to match the gradual rise in spending, as</a>
<a href="#bookmark1404" class="a">Figure 17.6</a> <span
class="p">illustrates. The main revenue sources for state and local
governments are sales taxes, property taxes, and revenue passed
along from the federal government, but many state and local
governments also levy personal and corporate income taxes, as well
as impose a wide variety of fees and charges. The specific sources
of tax revenue vary widely across state and local governments. Some
states rely more on property taxes, some on sales taxes, some on
income taxes, and some more on revenues from the federal
government.</span></p>

<p>Debt/GDP Ratio</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1408">Another useful way to view the budget
deficit is through the prism of accumulated debt rather than annual
deficits. The</span> <strong>national debt</strong>
<a href="#bookmark1409" class="s34">refers to the total amount that the government has borrowed over time. In contrast, the budget deficit refers to how much the government has borrowed in one particular year.</a>
<a href="#bookmark1409" class="a">Figure 17.8</a><span class="s54">
</span>shows the ratio of debt/GDP since 1940. Until the 1970s, the
debt/GDP ratio revealed a fairly clear pattern of federal borrowing.
The government ran up large deficits and raised the debt/GDP ratio
in World War II, but from the 1950s to the 1970s the government ran
either surpluses or relatively small deficits, and so the debt/GDP
ratio drifted down. Large deficits in the 1980s and early 1990s
caused the ratio to rise sharply. When budget surpluses arrived from
1998 to 2001, the debt/ GDP ratio declined substantially. The budget
deficits starting in 2002 then tugged the debt/GDP ratio higher—with
a big jump when the recession took hold in 2008–2009.</p>

annual budget deficits and surpluses. Annual deficits do not always
mean that the debt/GDP ratio is rising. During the 1960s and 1970s,
the government often ran small deficits, but since the debt was
growing more slowly than the economy, the debt/GDP ratio was
declining over this time. In the 2008–2009 recession, the debt/GDP
ratio rose sharply. (Source: </span><a class="reference external" href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/ERP-2015/content-detail.html">Economic Report of the

<p>What is the national debt?</p>
<p>One year’s federal budget deficit causes the federal government to
sell Treasury bonds to make up the difference between spending
programs and tax revenues. The dollar value of all the outstanding
Treasury bonds on which the federal government owes money is equal
to the national debt.</p>

<p>Government spending as a share of GDP declined steadily through the
1990s. The biggest single reason was that defense spending declined
from 5.2% of GDP in 1990 to 3.0% in 2000, but interest payments by
the federal government also fell by about 1.0% of GDP. However,
federal tax collections increased substantially in the later 1990s,
jumping from 18.1% of GDP in 1994 to 20.8% in 2000. Powerful
economic growth in the late 1990s fueled the boom in taxes. Personal
income taxes rise as income goes up; payroll taxes rise as jobs and
payrolls go up; corporate income taxes rise as profits go up. At the
same time, government spending on transfer payments such as
unemployment benefits, foods stamps, and welfare declined with more
people working.</p>
<p>This sharp increase in tax revenues and decrease in expenditures on
transfer payments was largely unexpected even by experienced budget
analysts, and so budget surpluses came as a surprise. However, in
the early 2000s, many of these factors started running in reverse.
Tax revenues sagged, due largely to the recession that started in
March 2001, which reduced revenues. Congress enacted a series of tax
cuts and President George W. Bush signed them into law, starting
in 2001. In addition, government spending swelled due to increases
in defense, healthcare, education, Social Security, and support
programs for those who were hurt by the recession and the slow
growth that followed. Deficits returned. When the severe recession
hit in late 2007, spending climbed and tax collections fell to
historically unusual levels, resulting in enormous deficits.</p>
<p>Longer-term U.S. budget forecasts, a decade or more into the future,
predict enormous deficits. The higher deficits during the 2008-2009
recession have repercussions, and the demographics will be
challenging. The primary reason is the “baby boom”—the exceptionally
high birthrates that began in 1946, right after World War II, and
lasted for about two decades. Starting in 2010, the front edge of
the baby boom generation began to reach age 65, and in the next two
decades, the proportion of Americans over the age of 65 will
increase substantially. The current level of the payroll taxes that
support Social Security and Medicare will fall well short of the
projected expenses of these programs, as the following Clear It Up
feature shows; thus, the forecast is for large budget deficits. A
decision to collect more revenue to support these programs or to
decrease benefit levels would alter this long-term forecast.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_365.png" width="624" height="477" alt="image" />
<p>What is the long-term budget outlook for Social Security and
Medicare?</p>
<p>In 1946, just one American in 13 was over age 65. By 2000, it was
one in eight. By 2030, one American in five will be over age 65. Two
enormous U.S. federal programs focus on the elderly—Social Security
and Medicare. The growing numbers of elderly Americans will increase
spending on these programs, as well as on Medicaid. The current
payroll tax levied on workers, which supports all of Social Security
and the hospitalization insurance part of Medicare, will not be
enough to cover the expected costs, so what are the options?</p>
<p>Long-term projections from the Congressional Budget Office in 2009
are that Medicare and Social Security spending combined will rise
from 8.3% of GDP in 2009 to about 13% by 2035 and about 20% in 2080.
If this rise in spending occurs, without any corresponding rise in
tax collections, then some mix of changes must occur: (1) taxes will
need to increase dramatically; (2) other spending will need to be
cut dramatically; (3) the retirement age and/or age receiving
Medicare benefits will need to increase, or (4) the federal
government will need to run extremely large budget deficits.</p>
<p>Some proposals suggest removing the cap on wages subject to the
payroll tax, so that those with very high incomes would have to pay
the tax on the entire amount of their wages. Other proposals suggest
moving Social Security and Medicare from systems in which workers
pay for retirees toward programs that set up accounts where workers
save funds over their lifetimes and then draw out after retirement
to pay for healthcare.</p>
<p>The United States is not alone in this problem. Providing the
promised level of retirement and health benefits to a growing
proportion of elderly with a falling proportion of workers is an
even more severe problem in many European nations and in Japan. How
to pay promised levels of benefits to the elderly will be a
difficult public policy decision.</p>

<p><span id="bookmark1412">Fiscal policy is the use of government spending
and tax policy to influence the path of the economy over time.
Graphically, we see that fiscal policy, whether through changes in
spending or taxes, shifts the aggregate demand outward in the case
of</span> <strong>expansionary fiscal policy</strong> and inward in the case of
<strong>contractionary fiscal
policy</strong><a href="#bookmark1415" class="s34">. We know from the chapter on economic growth that over time the quantity and quality of our resources grow as the population and thus the labor force get larger, as businesses invest in new capital, and as technology improves. The result of this is regular shifts to the right of the aggregate supply curves, as</a>
<a href="#bookmark1415" class="a">Figure 17.10</a><span class="s54">
</span>illustrates.<span id="bookmark1413">‌</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark1414">The original equilibrium occurs at E</span><span
class="s60">0</span>, the intersection of aggregate demand curve AD<span
class="s60">0</span> and aggregate supply curve SRAS<span
class="s60">0</span>, at an output level of 200 and a price level of 90.
One year later, aggregate supply has shifted to the right to SRAS<span
class="s60">1</span> in the process of long-term economic growth, and
aggregate demand has also shifted to the right to AD<span
class="s60">1</span>, keeping the economy operating at the new level of
potential GDP. The new equilibrium (E<span class="s60">1</span>) is an
output level of</p>
<p>206 and a price level of 92. One more year later, aggregate supply has
again shifted to the right, now to SRAS<span class="s60">2</span>, and
aggregate demand shifts right as well to AD<span class="s60">2</span>.
Now the equilibrium is E<span class="s60">2</span>, with an output level
of 212 and a price level of 94. In short, the figure shows an economy
that is growing steadily year to year, producing at its potential GDP
each year, with only small inflationary increases in the price level.</p>

<p><span id="bookmark1415"><span class="s36">Figure 17.10 A Healthy,
Growing Economy </span></span>In this well-functioning economy, each
year aggregate supply and aggregate demand shift to the right so that
the economy proceeds from equilibrium E<span class="s63">0</span> to
E<span class="s63">1</span> to E<span class="s63">2</span>. Each year,
the economy produces at potential GDP with only a small inflationary
increase in the price level. However, if aggregate demand does not
smoothly shift to the right and match increases in aggregate supply,
growth with deflation can develop.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1415" class="s34">Aggregate demand and aggregate supply do not always move neatly together. Think about what causes shifts in aggregate demand over time. As aggregate supply increases, incomes tend to go up. This tends to increase consumer and investment spending, shifting the aggregate demand curve to the right, but in any given period it may not shift the same amount as aggregate supply. What happens to government spending and taxes? Government spends to pay for the ordinary business of government- items such as national defense, social security, and healthcare, as</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark1415">Figure</a></p>
<p>17.10 <span class="p">shows. Tax revenues, in part, pay for these
expenditures. The result may be an increase in aggregate demand more
than or less than the increase in aggregate supply. Aggregate demand may
fail to increase along with aggregate supply, or aggregate demand may
even shift left, for a number of possible reasons: households become
hesitant about consuming; firms decide against investing as much; or
perhaps the demand from other countries for exports diminishes.</span></p>
<p>For example, investment by private firms in physical capital in the U.S.
economy boomed during the late 1990s, rising from 14.1% of GDP in 1993
to 17.2% in 2000, before falling back to 15.2% by 2002. Conversely, if
shifts in aggregate demand run ahead of increases in aggregate supply,
inflationary increases in the price level will result. Business cycles
of recession and recovery are the consequence of shifts in aggregate
supply and aggregate demand. As these occur, the government may choose
to use fiscal policy to address the difference.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1177" class="a">Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation</a>
<span class="p">shows us that a central bank can use its powers over the
banking system to engage in countercyclical—or “against the business
cycle”—actions. If recession threatens, the central bank uses an
expansionary monetary policy to increase the money supply, increase the
quantity of loans, reduce interest rates, and shift aggregate demand to
the right. If inflation threatens, the central bank uses contractionary
monetary policy to reduce the money supply, reduce the quantity of
loans, raise interest rates, and shift aggregate demand to the left.
Fiscal policy is another macroeconomic policy tool for adjusting
aggregate demand by using either government spending or taxation
policy.</span></p>
<p>Expansionary Fiscal Policy</p>
<p>Expansionary fiscal policy increases the level of aggregate demand,
through either increases in government spending or reductions in tax
rates. Expansionary policy can do this by (1) increasing consumption by
raising disposable income through cuts in personal income taxes or
payroll taxes; (2) increasing investment spending by raising after-tax
profits through cuts in business taxes; and (3) increasing government
purchases through increased federal government</p>
<p>spending on final goods and services and raising federal grants to state
and local governments to increase their expenditures on final goods and
services. Contractionary fiscal policy does the reverse: it decreases
the level of aggregate demand by decreasing consumption, decreasing
investment, and decreasing government spending, either through cuts in
government spending or increases in taxes. The aggregate
demand/aggregate supply model is useful in judging whether expansionary
or contractionary fiscal policy is appropriate.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1416" class="s34">Consider first the situation in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1416" class="a">Figure</a> <span
class="s54">17.11</span>, which is similar to the U.S. economy during
the 2008-2009 recession. The intersection of aggregate demand (AD<span
class="s60">0</span>) and aggregate supply (SRAS<span
class="s60">0</span>) is occurring below the level of potential GDP as
the LRAS curve indicates. At the equilibrium (E<span
class="s60">0</span>), a recession occurs and unemployment rises. In
this case, expansionary fiscal policy using tax cuts or increases in
government spending can shift aggregate demand to AD<span
class="s60">1</span>, closer to the full-employment level of output. In
addition, the price level would rise back to the level P<span
class="s60">1</span> associated with potential GDP.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_367.jpg" width="299" height="250" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark1416"><span class="s36">Figure 17.11 Expansionary
Fiscal Policy </span></span>The original equilibrium (E<span
class="s63">0</span>) represents a recession, occurring at a quantity of
output (Y<span class="s63">0</span>) below potential GDP. However, a
shift of aggregate demand from AD<span class="s63">0</span> to AD<span
class="s63">1</span>, enacted through an expansionary fiscal policy, can
move the economy to a new equilibrium output of E<span
class="s63">1</span> at the level of potential GDP which the LRAS curve
shows. Since the economy was originally producing below potential GDP,
any inflationary increase in the price level from P<span
class="s63">0</span> to P<span class="s63">1</span> that results should
be relatively small.</p>
<p>Should the government use tax cuts or spending increases, or a mix of
the two, to carry out expansionary fiscal policy? During the 2008-2009
Great Recession (which started, actually, in late 2007), the U.S.
economy suffered a 3.1% cumulative loss of GDP. That may not sound like
much, but it’s more than one year’s average growth rate of GDP. Over
that time frame, the unemployment rate doubled from 5% to 10%. The
consensus view is that this was possibly the worst economic downturn in
U.S. history since the 1930’s Great Depression. The choice between
whether to use tax or spending tools often has a political tinge. As a
general statement, conservatives and Republicans prefer to see
expansionary fiscal policy carried out by tax cuts, while liberals and
Democrats prefer that the government implement expansionary fiscal
policy through spending increases. In a bipartisan effort to address the
extreme situation, the Obama administration and Congress passed an $830
billion expansionary policy in early 2009 involving both tax cuts and
increases in government spending. At the same time, however, the federal
stimulus was partially offset when state and local governments, whose
budgets were hard hit by the recession, began cutting their spending.</p>
<p>The conflict over which policy tool to use can be frustrating to those
who want to categorize economics as “liberal” or “conservative,” or who
want to use economic models to argue against their political opponents.
However, advocates of smaller government, who seek to reduce taxes and
government spending can use the AD AS model, as well as advocates of
bigger government, who seek to raise taxes and government spending.
Economic studies of specific taxing and spending programs can help
inform decisions about whether the government should change taxes or
spending, and in what ways. Ultimately, decisions about whether to use
tax or spending mechanisms to implement macroeconomic policy is a
political decision rather than a purely economic one.</p>
<p>Contractionary Fiscal Policy</p>
<p>Fiscal policy can also contribute to pushing aggregate demand beyond
potential GDP in a way that leads to inflation.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1417" class="s34">As</a>
<a href="#bookmark1417" class="a">Figure 17.12</a><span class="s54">
</span>shows, a very large budget deficit pushes up aggregate demand, so
that the intersection of aggregate demand (AD<span class="s60">0</span>)
and aggregate supply (SRAS<span class="s60">0</span>) occurs at
equilibrium E<span class="s60">0</span>, which is an output level above
potential GDP. Economists sometimes call this an “overheating economy”
where demand is so high that there is upward pressure on wages and
prices, causing inflation. In this situation, contractionary fiscal
policy involving federal spending cuts or tax increases can help to
reduce the upward pressure on the price level by shifting aggregate
demand to the left, to AD<span class="s60">1</span>, and causing the new
equilibrium E<span class="s60">1</span> to be at potential GDP, where
aggregate demand intersects the LRAS curve.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_368.jpg" width="300" height="256" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark1417"><span class="s36">Figure 17.12 A Contractionary
Fiscal Policy </span></span>The economy starts at the equilibrium
quantity of output Y<span class="s63">0</span>, which is above potential
GDP. The extremely high level of aggregate demand will generate
inflationary increases in the price level. A contractionary fiscal
policy can shift aggregate demand down from AD<span class="s63">0</span>
to AD<span class="s63">1</span>, leading to a new equilibrium output
E<span class="s63">1</span>, which occurs at potential GDP, where AD1
intersects the LRAS curve.</p>
<p>Again, the AD–AS model does not dictate how the government should carry
out this contractionary fiscal policy. Some may prefer spending cuts;
others may prefer tax increases; still others may say that it depends on
the specific situation. The model only argues that, in this situation,
the government needs to reduce aggregate demand.</p>

</ul>
<p><span id="bookmark1419">The millions of unemployed in 2008–2009
could collect unemployment insurance benefits to replace some of
their salaries. Federal fiscal policies include</span>
<strong>discretionary fiscal policy</strong>, when the government passes a new
law that explicitly changes tax or spending levels. The 2009
stimulus package is an example. Changes in tax and spending levels
can also occur automatically, due to <strong>automatic stabilizers</strong>, such
as unemployment insurance and food stamps, which are programs that
are already laws that stimulate aggregate demand in a recession and
hold down aggregate demand in a potentially inflationary boom.<span
id="bookmark1420">‌</span></p>
<p>Counterbalancing Recession and Boom</p>
<p>Consider first the situation where aggregate demand has risen
sharply, causing the equilibrium to occur at a level of output above
potential GDP. This situation will increase inflationary pressure in
the economy. The policy prescription in this setting would be a dose
of contractionary fiscal policy, implemented through some
combination of higher taxes and lower spending. To some extent,
<em>both</em> changes happen automatically. On the tax side, a rise in
aggregate demand means that workers and firms throughout the economy
earn more. Because taxes are based on personal income and</p>
<p>corporate profits, a rise in aggregate demand automatically
increases tax payments. On the spending side, stronger aggregate
demand typically means lower unemployment and fewer layoffs, and so
there is less need for government spending on unemployment benefits,
welfare, Medicaid, and other programs in the social safety net.</p>
<p>The process works in reverse, too. If aggregate demand were to fall
sharply so that a recession occurs, then the prescription would be
for expansionary fiscal policy—some mix of tax cuts and spending
increases. The lower level of aggregate demand and higher
unemployment will tend to pull down personal incomes and corporate
profits, an effect that will reduce the amount of taxes owed
automatically. Higher unemployment and a weaker economy should lead
to increased government spending on unemployment benefits, welfare,
and other similar domestic programs. In 2009, the stimulus package
included an extension in the time allowed to collect unemployment
insurance. In addition, the automatic stabilizers react to a
weakening of aggregate demand with expansionary fiscal policy and
react to a strengthening of aggregate demand with contractionary
fiscal policy, just as the AD/AS analysis suggests.</p>
<p>A combination of automatic stabilizers and discretionary fiscal
policy produced the very large budget deficit in 2009. The Great
Recession, starting in late 2007, meant less tax-generating economic
activity, which triggered the automatic stabilizers that reduce
taxes. Most economists, even those who are concerned about a
possible pattern of persistently large budget deficits, are much
less concerned or even quite supportive of larger budget deficits in
the short run of a few years during and immediately after a severe
recession.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark619" class="s34">A glance back at economic history provides a second illustration of the power of automatic stabilizers. Remember that the length of economic upswings between recessions has become longer in the U.S. economy in recent decades (as we discussed in</a>
Unemployment<span class="p">). The three longest economic booms of
the twentieth century happened in the 1960s, the 1980s, and the
1991–2001 time period. One reason why the economy has tipped into
recession less frequently in recent decades is that the size of
government spending and taxes has increased in the second half of
the twentieth century. Thus, the automatic stabilizing effects from
spending and taxes are now larger than they were in the first half
of the twentieth century. Around 1900, for example, federal spending
was only about 2% of GDP. In 1929, just before the Great Depression
hit, government spending was still just 4% of GDP. In those earlier
times, the smaller size of government made automatic stabilizers far
less powerful than in the last few decades, when government spending
often hovers at 20% of GDP or more.</span></p>
<p>The Standardized Employment Deficit or Surplus</p>

<p><span id="bookmark1421">Each year, the nonpartisan Congressional
Budget Office (CBO) calculates the</span> <strong>standardized employment
budget</strong><a href="#bookmark1422" class="s34">—that is, what the budget deficit or surplus would be if the economy were producing at potential GDP, where people who look for work were finding jobs in a reasonable period of time and businesses were making normal profits, with the result that both workers and businesses would be earning more and paying more taxes. In effect, the standardized employment deficit eliminates the impact of the automatic stabilizers.</a>

<p><span id="bookmark1422">Figure 17.13 Comparison of Actual Budget
Deficits with the Standardized Employment Deficit</span> <span
class="s37">When the economy is in recession, the standardized
employment budget deficit is less than the actual budget deficit
because the economy is below potential GDP, and the automatic
stabilizers are reducing taxes and increasing spending.</span></p>
<p>When the economy is performing extremely well, the standardized
employment deficit (or surplus) is higher than the actual budget
deficit (or surplus) because the economy is producing about
potential GDP, so the automatic stabilizers are increasing taxes and
reducing the need for government spending. (Sources: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43977%3B">Actual and
Cyclically Adjusted Budget

<p>Notice that in recession years, like the early 1990s, 2001, or 2009,
the standardized employment deficit is smaller than the actual
deficit. During recessions, the automatic stabilizers tend to
increase the budget deficit, so if the economy was instead at full
employment, the deficit would be reduced. However, in the late 1990s
the standardized employment budget surplus was lower than the actual
budget surplus. The gap between the standardized budget deficit or
surplus and the actual budget deficit or surplus shows the impact of
the automatic stabilizers. More generally, the standardized budget
figures allow you to see what the budget deficit would look like
with the economy held constant—at its potential GDP level of output.</p>
<p>Automatic stabilizers occur quickly. Lower wages means that a lower
amount of taxes is withheld from paychecks right away. Higher
unemployment or poverty means that government spending in those
areas rises as quickly as people apply for benefits. However, while
the automatic stabilizers offset part of the shifts in aggregate
demand, they do not offset all or even most of it. Historically,
automatic stabilizers on the tax and spending side offset about 10%
of any initial movement in the level of output. This offset may not
seem enormous, but it is still useful. Automatic stabilizers, like
shock absorbers in a car, can be useful if they reduce the impact of
the worst bumps, even if they do not eliminate the bumps altogether.</p>

Fiscal Policy</span><span id="bookmark1423">‌</span></p>
<p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Understand how fiscal policy and monetary policy are
interconnected</p></li>
<li><p>Explain the three lag times that often occur when solving
economic problems</p></li>
<li><p>Identify the legal and political challenges of responding to an
economic problem</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1424">In the early 1960s, many leading
economists believed that the problem of the business cycle, and
the swings between cyclical unemployment and inflation, were a
thing of the past. On the cover of its December 31, 1965,
issue,</span> <em>Time</em> magazine, then the premier news magazine in
the United States, ran a picture of John Maynard Keynes, and the
story inside identified Keynesian theories as “the prime
influence on the world’s economies.” The article reported that
policymakers have “used Keynesian principles not only to avoid
the violent [business] cycles of prewar days but to produce
phenomenal economic growth and to achieve remarkably stable
prices.”</p>
<p>This happy consensus, however, did not last. The U.S. economy
suffered one recession from December 1969 to November 1970, a
deeper recession from November 1973 to March 1975, and then
double-dip recessions from</p>
<p>January to June 1980 and from July 1981 to November 1982. At
various times, inflation and unemployment both soared. Clearly,
the problems of macroeconomic policy had not been completely
solved. As economists began to consider what had gone wrong,
they identified a number of issues that make discretionary
fiscal policy more difficult than it had seemed in the rosy
optimism of the mid-1960s.</p>
<p>Fiscal Policy and Interest Rates</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1426" id="bookmark1425" class="s34">Because fiscal policy affects the quantity that the government borrows in financial capital markets, it not only affects aggregate demand—it can also affect interest rates. In</a>
<a href="#bookmark1426" class="a">Figure</a> <span
class="s54">17.14</span>, the original equilibrium (E<span
class="s60">0</span>) in the financial capital market occurs at
a quantity of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(800 billion and an interest rate of 6%. However,
an increase in government budget deficits shifts the demand for
financial capital from D&lt;span class=&quot;s60&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; to D&lt;span
class=&quot;s60&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;. The new equilibrium (E&lt;span
class=&quot;s60&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;) occurs at a quantity of \)</span>900 billion and
an interest rate of 7%.</p>
<p>A consensus estimate based on a number of studies is that an
increase in budget deficits (or a fall in budget surplus) by 1%
of GDP will cause an increase of 0.5–1.0% in the long-term
interest rate.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_371.jpg" width="301" height="256" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark1426"><span class="s36">Figure 17.14 Fiscal
Policy and Interest Rates </span></span>When a government
borrows money in the financial capital market, it causes a shift
in the demand for financial capital from D<span
class="s63">0</span> to D<span class="s63">1</span>. As the
equilibrium moves from E<span class="s63">0</span> to E<span
class="s63">1</span>, the equilibrium interest rate rises from
6% to 7% in this example. In this way, an expansionary fiscal
policy intended to shift aggregate demand to the right can also
lead to a higher interest rate, which has the effect of shifting
aggregate demand back to the left.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1427">A problem arises here. An expansionary
fiscal policy, with tax cuts or spending increases, is intended
to increase aggregate demand. If an expansionary fiscal policy
also causes higher interest rates, then firms and households are
discouraged from borrowing and spending (as occurs with tight
monetary policy), thus reducing aggregate demand. Even if the
direct effect of expansionary fiscal policy on increasing demand
is not totally offset by lower aggregate demand from higher
interest rates, fiscal policy can end up less powerful than was
originally expected. We refer to this as</span> <strong>crowding
out</strong>, where government borrowing and spending results in higher
interest rates, which reduces business investment and household
consumption.</p>
<p>The broader lesson is that the government must coordinate fiscal
and monetary policy. If expansionary fiscal policy is to work
well, then the central bank can also reduce or keep short-term
interest rates low. Conversely, monetary policy can also help to
ensure that contractionary fiscal policy does not lead to a
recession.</p>
<p>Long and Variable Time Lags</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1428">The government can change monetary
policy several times each year, but it takes much longer to
enact fiscal policy. Imagine that the economy starts to slow
down. It often takes some months before the economic statistics
signal clearly that a downturn has started, and a few months
more to confirm that it is truly a recession and not just a one-
or two-month blip. Economists often call the time it takes to
determine that a recession has occurred the</span> <strong>recognition
lag</strong>. After this lag, policymakers become aware of the problem
and propose fiscal policy bills. The bills go into various
congressional committees for hearings, negotiations, votes, and
then, if passed, eventually for the president’s</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1429">signature. Many fiscal policy bills
about spending or taxes propose changes that would start in the
next budget year or would be phased in gradually over time.
Economists often refer to the time it takes to pass a bill as
the</span> <strong>legislative lag</strong>. Finally, once the government
passes the bill it takes some time to disperse the funds to the
appropriate agencies to implement the programs. Economists call
the time it takes to start the projects the <strong>implementation
lag</strong>.<span id="bookmark1430">‌</span></p>
<p>Moreover, the exact level of fiscal policy that the government
should implement is never completely clear. Should it increase
the budget deficit by 0.5% of GDP? By 1% of GDP? By 2% of GDP?
In an AD/AS diagram, it is straightforward to sketch an
aggregate demand curve shifting to the potential GDP level of
output. In the real world, we only know roughly, not precisely,
the actual level of potential output, and exactly how a spending
cut or tax increase will affect aggregate demand is always
somewhat controversial. Also unknown is the state of the economy
at any point in time. During the early days of the Obama
administration, for example, no one knew the true extent of the
economy’s deficit. During the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the
rapid collapse of the banking system and automotive sector made
it difficult to assess how quickly the economy was collapsing.</p>
<p>Thus, it can take many months or even more than a year to begin
an expansionary fiscal policy after a recession has started—and
even then, uncertainty will remain over exactly how much to
expand or contract taxes and spending. When politicians attempt
to use countercyclical fiscal policy to fight recession or
inflation, they run the risk of responding to the macroeconomic
situation of two or three years ago, in a way that may be
exactly wrong for the economy at that time. George P. Schultz, a
professor of economics, former Secretary of the Treasury, and
Director of the Office of Management and Budget, once wrote:
“While the economist is accustomed to the concept of lags, the
politician likes instant results. The tension comes because, as
I have seen on many occasions, the economist’s lag is the
politician’s nightmare.”</p>
<p>Temporary and Permanent Fiscal Policy</p>
<p>A temporary tax cut or spending increase will explicitly last
only for a year or two, and then revert to its original level. A
permanent tax cut or spending increase is expected to stay in
place for the foreseeable future. The effect of temporary and
permanent fiscal policies on aggregate demand can be very
different. Consider how you would react if the government
announced a tax cut that would last one year and then be
repealed, in comparison with how you would react if the
government announced a permanent tax cut. Most people and firms
will react more strongly to a permanent policy change than a
temporary one.</p>
<p>This fact creates an unavoidable difficulty for countercyclical
fiscal policy. The appropriate policy may be to have an
expansionary fiscal policy with large budget deficits during a
recession, and then a contractionary fiscal policy with budget
surpluses when the economy is growing well. However, if both
policies are explicitly temporary ones, they will have a less
powerful effect than a permanent policy.</p>

<p><a href="#bookmark1177" class="s34">When an economy recovers from a recession, it does not usually revert to its exact earlier shape. Instead, the economy’s internal structure evolves and changes and this process can take time. For example, much of the economic growth of the mid-2000s was in the construction sector (especially of housing) and finance. However, when housing prices started falling in 2007 and the resulting financial crunch led into recession (as we discussed in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1177" class="a">Monetary Policy and Bank</a>
Regulation<span class="p">), both sectors contracted. The
manufacturing sector of the U.S. economy has been losing jobs in
recent years as well, under pressure from technological change
and foreign competition. Many of the people who lost work from
these sectors in the 2008-2009 Great Recession will never return
to the same jobs in the same sectors of the economy. Instead,
the economy will need to grow in new and different directions,
as the following Clear It Up feature shows. Fiscal policy can
increase overall demand, but the process of structural economic
change—the expansion of a new set of industries and the movement
of workers to those industries—inevitably takes time.</span></p>
<p>Why do jobs vanish?</p>
<p>People can lose jobs for a variety of reasons: because of a
recession, but also because of longer-run changes in the
economy, such as new technology. Productivity improvements in
auto manufacturing, for example, can</p>
<p>reduce the number of workers needed, and eliminate these jobs in
the long run. The internet has created jobs but also caused job
loss, from travel agents to book store clerks. Many of these
jobs may never come back. Short-run fiscal policy to reduce
unemployment can create jobs, but it cannot replace jobs that
will never return.</p>

<span style=" color: #000;">to read about how fiscal policies
are affecting the recovery.</span></p>
<p>Fiscal policy can help an economy that is producing below its
potential GDP to expand aggregate demand so that it produces
closer to potential GDP, thus lowering unemployment. However,
fiscal policy cannot help an economy produce at an output level
above potential GDP without causing inflation At this point,
unemployment becomes so low that workers become scarce and wages
rise rapidly.</p>
<p>Political Realties and Discretionary Fiscal Policy</p>
<p>A final problem for discretionary fiscal policy arises out of
the difficulties of explaining to politicians how
countercyclical fiscal policy that runs against the tide of the
business cycle should work. Some politicians have a gut- level
belief that when the economy and tax revenues slow down, it is
time to hunker down, pinch pennies, and trim expenses.
Countercyclical policy, however, says that when the economy has
slowed, it is time for the government to stimulate the economy,
raising spending, and cutting taxes. This offsets the drop in
the economy in the other sectors. Conversely, when economic
times are good and tax revenues are rolling in, politicians
often feel that it is time for tax cuts and new spending.
However, countercyclical policy says that this economic boom
should be an appropriate time for keeping taxes high and
restraining spending.</p>
<p>Politicians tend to prefer expansionary fiscal policy over
contractionary policy. There is rarely a shortage of proposals
for tax cuts and spending increases, especially during
recessions. However, politicians are less willing to hear the
message that in good economic times, they should propose tax
increases and spending limits. In the economic upswing of the
late 1990s and early 2000s, for example, the U.S. GDP grew
rapidly. Estimates from respected government economic
forecasters like the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and
the Office of Management and Budget stated that the GDP was
above potential GDP, and that unemployment rates were
unsustainably low. However, no mainstream politician took the
lead in saying that the booming economic times might be an
appropriate time for spending cuts or tax increases. As of
February 2017, President Trump has expressed plans to increase
spending on national defense by 10% or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(54 billion, increase
infrastructure investment by \)</span>1 trillion, cut corporate and
personal income taxes, all while maintaining the existing
spending on Social Security and Medicare. The only way this math
adds up is with a sizeable increase in the Federal budget
deficit.</p>
<p>Discretionary Fiscal Policy: Summing Up</p>
<p>Expansionary fiscal policy can help to end recessions and
contractionary fiscal policy can help to reduce inflation. Given
the uncertainties over interest rate effects, time lags,
temporary and permanent policies, and unpredictable political
behavior, many economists and knowledgeable policymakers had
concluded by the mid-1990s that discretionary fiscal policy was
a blunt instrument, more like a club than a scalpel. It might
still make sense to use</p>
<p>it in extreme economic situations, like an especially deep or
long recession. For less extreme situations, it was often
preferable to let fiscal policy work through the automatic
stabilizers and focus on monetary policy to steer short-term
countercyclical efforts.</p>

<li><p><span id="bookmark1381">|</span> <span style=" color: #3767B1;">The
Question of a Balanced Budget</span><span id="bookmark1431">‌</span></p>
<p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Understand the arguments for and against requiring the U.S.
federal budget to be balanced</p></li>
<li><p>Consider the long-run and short-run effects of a federal budget
deficit</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For many decades, going back to the 1930s, various legislators have put
forward proposals to require that the</p>
<p>U.S. government balance its budget every year. In 1995, a proposed
constitutional amendment that would require a balanced budget passed the
U.S. House of Representatives by a wide margin, and failed in the U.S.
Senate by only a single vote. (For the balanced budget to have become an
amendment to the Constitution would have required a two- thirds vote by
Congress and passage by three-quarters of the state legislatures.)</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1432">Most economists view the proposals for a
perpetually balanced budget with bemusement. After all, in the short
term, economists would expect the budget deficits and surpluses to
fluctuate up and down with the economy and the automatic stabilizers.
Economic recessions should automatically lead to larger budget deficits
or smaller budget surpluses, while economic booms lead to smaller
deficits or larger surpluses. A requirement that the budget be balanced
each and every year would prevent these automatic stabilizers from
working and would worsen the severity of economic fluctuations.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark1433">Some supporters of the balanced budget amendment
like to argue that, since households must balance their own budgets, the
government should too. However, this analogy between household and
government behavior is severely flawed. Most households do not balance
their budgets every year. Some years households borrow to buy houses or
cars or to pay for medical expenses or college tuition. Other years they
repay loans and save funds in retirement accounts. After retirement,
they withdraw and spend those savings. Also, the government is not a
household for many reasons, one of which is that the government has
macroeconomic responsibilities. The argument of Keynesian macroeconomic
policy is that the government needs to lean against the wind, spending
when times are hard and saving when times are good, for the sake of the
overall economy.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark1434">There is also no particular reason to expect a
government budget to be balanced in the medium term of a few years. For
example, a government may decide that by running large budget deficits,
it can make crucial long-term investments in human capital and physical
infrastructure that will build the country’s long-term productivity.
These decisions may work out well or poorly, but they are not always
irrational. Such policies of ongoing government budget deficits may
persist for decades. As the U.S. experience from the end of World War II
up to about 1980 shows, it is perfectly possible to run budget deficits
almost every year for decades, but as long as the percentage increases
in debt are smaller than the percentage growth of GDP, the debt/GDP
ratio will decline at the same time.</span></p>

<p>The 2013 federal budget shutdown illustrated the many sides to fiscal
policy and the federal budget. In 2013, Republicans and Democrats could
not agree on which spending policies to fund and how large the
government debt should be. Due to the severity of the 2008-2009
recession, the fiscal stimulus, and previous</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1483" class="s34">Nothing in this argument is a claim that budget deficits are always a wise policy. In the short run, a government that runs a very large budget deficit can shift aggregate demand to the right and trigger severe inflation. Additionally, governments may borrow for foolish or impractical reasons.</a>

<span class="p">will discuss how large budget deficits, by reducing
national saving, can in certain cases reduce economic growth and even
contribute to international financial crises. A requirement that the
budget be balanced in each calendar year, however, is a misguided
overreaction to the fear that in some cases, budget deficits can become
too large.</span></p>
<p>policies, the federal budget deficit and debt was historically high. One
way to try to cut federal spending and borrowing was to refuse to raise
the legal federal debt limit, or tie on conditions to appropriation
bills to stop the Affordable Health Care Act. This disagreement led to a
two-week federal government shutdown and got close to the deadline where
the federal government would default on its Treasury bonds. Finally,
however, a compromise emerged and the government avoided default. This
shows clearly how closely fiscal policies are tied to politics.</p>

<p>KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY</p>
<ol>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark1386" class="a">Government</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark1386">Spending</a></p>
<p>Fiscal policy is the set of policies that relate to federal
government spending, taxation, and borrowing. In recent decades, the
level of federal government spending and taxes, expressed as a share
of GDP, has not changed much, typically fluctuating between about
18% to 22% of GDP. However, the level of state spending and taxes,
as a share of GDP, has risen from about 12–13% to about 20% of GDP
over the last four decades. The four main areas of federal spending
are national defense, Social Security, healthcare, and interest
payments, which together account for about 70% of all federal
spending. When a government spends more than it collects in taxes,
it is said to have a budget deficit. When a government collects more
in taxes than it spends, it is said to have a budget surplus. If
government spending and taxes are equal, it is said to have a
balanced budget. The sum of all past deficits and surpluses make up
the government debt.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="#bookmark1393">Taxation</a></p>
<p>The two main federal taxes are individual income taxes and payroll
taxes that provide funds for Social Security and Medicare; these
taxes together account for more than 80% of federal revenues. Other
federal taxes include the corporate income tax, excise taxes on
alcohol, gasoline and tobacco, and the estate and gift tax. A
progressive tax is one, like the federal income tax, where those
with higher incomes pay a higher share of taxes out of their income
than those with lower incomes. A proportional tax is one, like the
payroll tax for Medicare, where everyone pays the same share of
taxes regardless of income level. A regressive tax is one, like the
payroll tax (above a certain threshold) that supports Social
Security, where those with high income pay a lower share of income
in taxes than those with lower incomes.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark1405" class="a">Federal Deficits and the National</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark1405">Debt</a></p>
<p>For most of the twentieth century, the U.S. government took on debt
during wartime and then paid down that debt slowly in peacetime.
However, it took on quite substantial debts in peacetime in the
1980s and early 1990s, before a brief period of budget surpluses
from 1998 to 2001, followed by a return to annual budget deficits
since 2002, with very large deficits in the recession of 2008
and 2009. A budget deficit or budget surplus is measured annually.
Total government debt or national debt is the sum of budget deficits
and budget surpluses over time.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark1411" class="a">Using Fiscal Policy to Fight Recession, Unemployment, and</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark1411">Inflation</a></p>
<p>Expansionary fiscal policy increases the level of aggregate demand,
either through increases in government spending or through
reductions in taxes. Expansionary fiscal policy is most appropriate
when an economy is in recession and producing below its potential
GDP. Contractionary fiscal policy decreases the level of aggregate
demand, either through cuts in government spending or increases in
taxes. Contractionary fiscal policy is most appropriate when an
economy is producing above its potential GDP.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark1418" class="a">Automatic</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark1418">Stabilizers</a></p>
<p>Fiscal policy is conducted both through discretionary fiscal policy,
which occurs when the government enacts taxation or spending changes
in response to economic events, or through automatic stabilizers,
which are taxing and spending mechanisms that, by their design,
shift in response to economic events without any further
legislation. The standardized employment budget is the calculation
of what the budget deficit or budget surplus would have been in a
given year if the economy had been producing at its potential GDP in
that year. Many economists and politicians criticize the use of
fiscal policy for a variety of reasons, including concerns over time
lags, the impact on interest rates, and the inherently political
nature of fiscal policy. We cover the critique of fiscal policy in
the next module.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark1423" class="a">Practical Problems with Discretionary Fiscal</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark1423">Policy</a></p>
<p>Because fiscal policy affects the quantity of money that the
government borrows in financial capital markets, it not only affects
aggregate demand—it can also affect interest rates. If an
expansionary fiscal policy also causes higher interest rates, then
firms and households are discouraged from borrowing and spending,
reducing aggregate demand in a situation called crowding out. Given
the uncertainties over interest rate effects, time lags
(implementation lag, legislative lag, and recognition lag),
temporary and permanent policies, and unpredictable political
behavior, many economists and knowledgeable policymakers have
concluded that discretionary fiscal policy is a blunt instrument and
better used only in extreme situations.</p>

<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark1431">Budget</a></p></li>
</ol>
<p>Balanced budget amendments are a popular political idea, but the
economic merits behind such proposals are questionable. Most economists
accept that fiscal policy needs to be flexible enough to accommodate
unforeseen expenditures, such as wars or recessions. While persistent,
large budget deficits can indeed be a problem, a balanced budget
amendment prevents even small, temporary deficits that might, in some
cases, be necessary.</p>

<p>Financing Higher Education</p>
<p>On November 8, 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed The Higher
Education Act of 1965 into law. With a stroke of the pen, he
implemented what we know as the financial aid, work study, and
student loan programs to help Americans pay for a college education.
In his remarks, the President said:</p>
<p>Here the seeds were planted from which grew my firm conviction that
for the individual, education is the path to achievement and
fulfillment; for the Nation, it is a path to a society that is not
only free but civilized; and for the world, it is the path to
peace—for it is education that places reason over force.</p>
<p>This Act, he said, “is responsible for funding higher education for
millions of Americans. It is the embodiment of the United States’
investment in ‘human capital’.” Since Johnson signed the Act into
law, the government has renewed it several times.</p>
<p>The purpose of The Higher Education Act of 1965 was to build the
country’s human capital by creating educational opportunity for
millions of Americans. The three criteria that the government uses
to judge eligibility are income, full-time or part-time attendance,
and the cost of the institution. According to the 2011–2012 National
Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:12), in the 2011–2012 school
year, over 70% of all full-time college students received some form
of federal financial aid; 47% received grants; and another 55%
received federal government student loans. The budget to support
financial aid has increased not only because of more enrollment, but
also because of increased tuition and fees for higher education.</p>

<p>The current Trump administration is currently questioning these
increases and the entire notion of how the government should deal
with higher education. The President and Congress are charged with
balancing fiscal responsibility and important government-financed
expenditures like investing in human capital.</p>

<li><p>Fiscal Policy and the Trade Balance</p>
<p>Governments have many competing demands for financial support. Any
spending should be tempered by fiscal responsibility and by looking
carefully at the spending’s impact. When a government spends more
than it collects in taxes, it runs a budget deficit. It then needs
to borrow. When government borrowing becomes especially large and
sustained, it can substantially reduce the financial capital
available to private sector firms, as well as lead to trade
imbalances and even financial crises.</p>

<a href="#bookmark780" class="a">The International Trade and Capital</a>
Flows <span class="p">chapter, to show how government borrowing
affects firms’ physical capital investment levels and trade
balances. A prolonged period of budget deficits may lead to lower
economic growth, in part because the funds that the government
borrows to fund its budget deficits are typically no longer
available for private investment. Moreover, a sustained pattern of
large budget deficits can lead to disruptive economic patterns of
high inflation, substantial inflows of financial capital from
abroad, plummeting exchange rates, and heavy strains on a country’s
banking and financial system.</span></p>

<p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Explain the national saving and investment identity in terms
of demand and supply</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate the role of budget surpluses and trade surpluses in
national saving and investment identity</p>
<p>When governments are borrowers in financial markets, there
are three possible sources for the funds from a
macroeconomic point of view: (1) households might save
more; (2) private firms might borrow less; and (3) the
additional funds for government borrowing might come from
outside the country, from foreign financial investors. Let’s
begin with a review of why one of these three options must
occur, and then explore how interest rates and exchange
rates adjust to these connections.</p>
<p>The National Saving and Investment Identity</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark780" id="bookmark1485" class="s34">The national saving and investment identity, which we first introduced in</a>
<a href="#bookmark780" class="a">The International Trade and Capital Flows</a>
<span class="p">chapter, provides a framework for showing
the relationships between the sources of demand and supply
in financial capital markets. The identity begins with a
statement that must always hold true: the quantity of
financial capital supplied in the market must equal the
quantity of financial capital demanded.</span></p>
<p>The U.S. economy has two main sources for financial capital:
private savings from inside the U.S. economy and public
savings.</p>
<p>Total savings = Private savings (S) + Public savings (T – G)</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark780" class="s34">These include the inflow of foreign financial capital from abroad. The inflow of savings from abroad is, by definition, equal to the trade deficit, as we explained in</a>
<a href="#bookmark780" class="a">The International Trade and Capital Flows</a>
<span class="p">chapter. We can write this inflow of foreign
investment capital as imports (M) minus exports (X). There
are also two main sources of demand for financial capital:
private sector investment (I) and government borrowing.
Government borrowing in any given year is equal to the
budget deficit, which we can write as the difference between
government spending (G) and net taxes (T). Let’s call this
equation 1.</span></p>
<p>Quantity supplied of financial capital = Quantity demanded
of financial capital</p>
<p>Private savings + Inflow of foreign savings = Private
investment + Government budget deficit</p>
<p>S + (M – X) = I + (G –T)</p>
<p>Governments often spend more than they receive in taxes and,
therefore, public savings (T – G) is negative. This causes a
need to borrow money in the amount of (G – T) instead of
adding to the nation’s savings. If this is the case, we can
view governments as demanders of financial capital instead
of suppliers. In algebraic terms, we can rewrite the
national savings and investment identity like this:</p>
<p>Private investment = Private savings + Public savings +
Trade deficit I = S + (T – G) + (M – X)</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1486" class="s34">Let’s call this equation 2. We must accompany a change in any part of the national saving and investment identity by offsetting changes in at least one other part of the equation because we assume that the equality of quantity supplied and quantity demanded always holds. If the government budget deficit changes, then either private saving or investment or the trade balance—or some combination of the three—must change as well.</a>
<a href="#bookmark1486" class="a">Figure 18.2</a> <span
class="p">shows the possible effects.</span></p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_377.jpg" width="624" height="179" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark1486">Figure 18.2 Effects of Change in
Budget Surplus or Deficit on Investment, Savings, and The
Trade Balance</span> <span class="s37">Chart (a) shows the
potential results when the budget deficit rises (or budget
surplus falls). Chart (b) shows the potential results when
the budget deficit falls (or budget surplus rises).</span></p>
<p>What about Budget Surpluses and Trade Surpluses?</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1487">The national saving and investment
identity must always hold true because, by definition, the
quantity supplied and quantity demanded in the financial
capital market must always be equal. However, the formula
will look somewhat different if the government budget is in
deficit rather than surplus or if the balance of trade is in
surplus rather than deficit. For example, in 1999 and 2000,
the U.S. government had budget surpluses, although the
economy was still experiencing trade deficits. When the
government was running budget surpluses, it was acting as a
saver rather than a borrower, and supplying rather than
demanding financial capital. As a result, we would write the
national saving and investment identity during this time
as:</span><span id="bookmark1488">‌</span></p>
<p>Quantity supplied of financial capital = Quantity demanded
of financial capital Private savings + Trade deficit +
Government surplus = Private investment</p>
<p>S + (M – X) + (T – G) = I</p>
<p>Let’s call this equation 3. Notice that this expression is
mathematically the same as equation 2 except the savings and
investment sides of the identity have simply flipped sides.</p>
<p>During the 1960s, the U.S. government was often running a
budget deficit, but the economy was typically running</p>
<p>trade surpluses. Since a trade surplus means that an economy
is experiencing a net outflow of financial capital, we would
write the national saving and investment identity as:</p>
<p>Quantity supplied of financial capital = Quantity demanded
of financial capital</p>
<p>Private savings = Private investment + Outflow of foreign
savings + Government budget deficit S = I + (X – M) + (G
– T)</p>
<p>Instead of the balance of trade representing part of the
supply of financial capital, which occurs with a trade
deficit, a trade surplus represents an outflow of financial
capital leaving the domestic economy and invested elsewhere
in the world.</p>
<p>Quantity supplied of financial capital = Quantity demanded
of financial capital demand</p>
<p>Private savings = Private investment + Government budget
deficit + Trade surplus S = I + (G – T) + (X – M)</p>
<p>We assume that the point to these equations is that the
national saving and investment identity always hold. When
you write these relationships, it is important to engage
your brain and think about what is on the supply and demand
side of the financial capital market before you start your
calculations.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1489" class="s34">As you can see in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1489" class="a">Figure</a> 18.3<span
class="p">, the Office of Management and Budget shows that
the United States has consistently run budget deficits since
1977, with the exception of 1999 and 2000. What is alarming
is the dramatic increase in budget deficits that has
occurred since 2008, which in part reflects declining tax
revenues and increased safety net expenditures due to the
Great Recession. (Recall that T is net taxes. When the
government must transfer funds back to individuals for
safety net expenditures like Social Security and
unemployment benefits, budget deficits rise.) These deficits
have implications for the future health of the U.S.
economy.</span></p>

<p><a href="#bookmark952" class="s34">Government budget balances can affect the trade balance. As</a>
<a href="#bookmark952" class="a">The Keynesian Perspective</a> <span
class="p">chapter discusses, a net inflow of foreign financial
investment always accompanies a trade deficit, while a net outflow of
financial investment always accompanies a trade surplus. One way to
understand the connection from budget deficits to trade deficits is that
when government creates a budget deficit with some combination of tax
cuts or spending increases, it will increase aggregate demand in the
economy, and some of that increase in aggregate demand will result in a
higher level of imports. A higher level of imports, with exports
remaining fixed, will cause a larger trade deficit. That means
foreigners’ holdings of dollars increase as Americans purchase more
imported goods. Foreigners use those dollars to invest in the United
States, which leads to an inflow of foreign investment. One possible
source of funding our budget deficit is foreigners buying Treasury
securities that the U.S. government sells, thus a trade deficit often
accompanies a budget deficit.</span></p>
<p>Twin Deficits?</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1491" class="s34">In the mid-1980s, it was common to hear economists and even newspaper articles refer to the twin deficits, as the budget deficit and trade deficit both grew substantially.</a>
<a href="#bookmark1491" class="a">Figure 18.4</a> <span class="p">shows
the pattern. The federal budget deficit went from 2.6% of GDP in 1981 to
5.1% of GDP in 1985—a drop of 2.5% of GDP. Over that time, the trade
deficit moved from 0.5% in 1981 to 2.9% in 1985—a drop of 2.4% of GDP.
In the mid-1980s an inflow of foreign investment capital matched, the
considerable increase in government borrowing, so the government budget
deficit and the trade deficit moved together.</span></p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_379.jpg" width="506" height="254" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark1491">Figure 18.4 U.S. Budget Deficits and Trade
Deficits</span> <span class="s37">In the 1980s, the budget deficit and
the trade deficit declined at the same time. However, since then, the
deficits have stopped being twins. The trade deficit grew smaller in the
early 1990s as the budget deficit increased, and then the trade deficit
grew larger in the late 1990s as the budget deficit turned into a
surplus. In the first half of the 2000s, both budget and trade deficits
increased. However, in 2009, the trade deficit declined as the budget
deficit increased.</span></p>
<p>Of course, no one should expect the budget deficit and trade deficit to
move in lockstep, because the other parts of the national saving and
investment identity—investment and private savings—will often change as
well. In the late 1990s, for example, the government budget balance
turned from deficit to surplus, but the trade deficit remained large and
growing. During this time, the inflow of foreign financial investment
was supporting a surge of physical capital investment by U.S. firms. In
the first half of the 2000s, the budget and trade deficits again
increased together, but in</p>
<p>2009, the budget deficit increased while the trade deficit declined. The
budget deficit and the trade deficits are related to each other, but
they are more like cousins than twins.</p>
<p>Budget Deficits and Exchange Rates</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1493" id="bookmark1492" class="s34">Exchange rates can also help to explain why budget deficits are linked to trade deficits.</a>
<a href="#bookmark1493" class="a">Figure 18.5</a><span class="s54">
</span>shows a situation using the exchange rate for the U.S. dollar,
measured in euros. At the original equilibrium (E<span
class="s60">0</span>), where the demand for</p>
<p>U.S. dollars (D<span class="s60">0</span>) intersects with the supply of
U.S. dollars (S<span class="s60">0</span>) on the foreign exchange
market, the exchange rate is</p>
<p>0.9 euros per U.S. dollar and the equilibrium quantity traded in the
market is $100 billion per day (which was roughly the quantity of
dollar–euro trading in exchange rate markets in the mid-2000s). Then the
U.S. budget deficit rises and foreign financial investment provides the
source of funds for that budget deficit.</p>
<p>International financial investors, as a group, will demand more U.S.
dollars on foreign exchange markets to purchase the U.S. government
bonds, and they will supply fewer of the U.S. dollars that they already
hold in these markets. Demand for U.S. dollars on the foreign exchange
market shifts from D<span class="s60">0</span> to D<span
class="s60">1</span> and the supply of U.S. dollars falls from S<span
class="s60">0</span> to S<span class="s60">1</span>. At the new
equilibrium (E<span class="s60">1</span>), the exchange rate has
appreciated to 1.05 euros per dollar while, in this example, the
quantity of dollars traded remains the same.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_380.jpg" width="262" height="218" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark1493"><span class="s36">Figure 18.5 Budget Deficits
and Exchange Rates </span></span>Imagine that the U.S. government
increases its borrowing and the funds come from European financial
investors. To purchase U.S. government bonds, those European investors
will need to demand more U.S. dollars on foreign exchange markets,
causing the demand for U.S. dollars to shift to the right from D<span
class="s63">0</span> to D<span class="s63">1</span>. European financial
investors as a group will also be less likely to supply U.S. dollars to
the foreign exchange markets, causing the supply of U.S. dollars to
shift from S<span class="s63">0</span> to S<span class="s63">1</span>.
The equilibrium exchange rate strengthens from 0.9 euro/ dollar at
E<span class="s63">0</span> to 1.05 euros/dollar at E<span
class="s63">1</span>.</p>
<p>A stronger exchange rate, of course, makes it more difficult for
exporters to sell their goods abroad while making imports cheaper, so a
trade deficit (or a reduced trade surplus) results. Thus, a budget
deficit can easily result in an inflow of foreign financial capital, a
stronger exchange rate, and a trade deficit.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1504" class="s34">You can also imagine interest rates are driving the exchange rate appreciation. As we explained earlier in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1504" class="a">Figure</a> 18.8<span class="p">, a
budget deficit increases demand in markets for domestic financial
capital, raising the domestic interest rate. A higher interest rate will
attract an inflow of foreign financial capital, and appreciate the
exchange rate in response to the increase in demand for U.S. dollars by
foreign investors and a decrease in supply of U. S. dollars. Because of
higher interest rates in the United States, Americans find U.S. bonds
more attractive than foreign bonds. When Americans are buying fewer
foreign bonds, they are supplying fewer U.S. dollars. U.S. dollar
depreciation leads to a larger trade deficit (or reduced surplus). The
connections between inflows of foreign investment capital, interest
rates, and exchange rates are all just different ways of drawing the
same economic connections: a larger budget deficit can result in a
larger trade deficit, although do not expect the connection to be
one-to-one.</span></p>
<p>From Budget Deficits to International Economic Crisis</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1285" class="s34">We lay out step-by-step the economic story of how an outflow of international financial capital can cause a deep recession in the</a>
<a href="#bookmark1285" class="a">Exchange Rates and International Capital</a>
Flows <span class="p">chapter. When international financial investors
decide to withdraw their funds from a country like Turkey, they increase
the supply of the Turkish lira and reduce the demand for lira,
depreciating the lira exchange rate. When firms and the government in a
country like</span></p>
<p>Turkey borrow money in international financial markets, they typically
do so in stages. First, banks in Turkey borrow in a widely used currency
like U.S. dollars or euros, then convert those U.S. dollars to lira, and
then lend the money to borrowers in Turkey. If the lira’s exchange rate
value depreciates, then Turkey’s banks will find it impossible to repay
the international loans that are in U.S. dollars or euros.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1494">The combination of less foreign investment
capital and banks that are bankrupt can sharply reduce aggregate demand,
which causes a deep recession. Many countries around the world have
experienced this kind of recession in recent years: along with Turkey in
2002, Mexico followed this general pattern in 1995, Thailand and
countries across East Asia in 1997–1998, Russia in 1998, and Argentina
in 2002. In many of these countries, large government budget deficits
played a role in setting the stage for the financial crisis. A moderate
increase in a budget deficit that leads to a moderate increase in a
trade deficit and a moderate appreciation of the exchange rate is not
necessarily a cause for concern. However, beyond some point that is hard
to define in advance, a series of large budget deficits can become a
cause for concern among international investors.</span></p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_381.png" width="624" height="515" alt="image" />
<p>One reason for concern is that extremely large budget deficits mean that
aggregate demand may shift so far to the right as to cause high
inflation. The example of Turkey is a situation where very large budget
deficits brought inflation rates well into double digits. In addition,
very large budget deficits at some point begin to raise a fear that the
government would not repay the borrowing. In the last 175 years, the
government of Turkey has been unable to pay its debts and defaulted on
its loans six times. Brazil’s government has been unable to pay its
debts and defaulted on its loans seven times; Venezuela, nine times; and
Argentina, five times. The risk of high inflation or a default on
repaying international loans will worry international investors, since
both factors imply that the rate of return on their investments in that
country may end up lower than expected. If international investors start
withdrawing the funds from a country rapidly, the scenario of less
investment, a depreciated exchange rate, widespread bank failure, and
deep recession can occur. The following Clear It Up feature explains
other impacts of large deficits.</p>
<p>What are the risks of chronic large deficits in the United States?</p>
<p>If a government runs large budget deficits for a sustained period of
time, what can go wrong? According to a recent Brookings Institution
report, a key risk of a large budget deficit is that government debt may
grow too high compared to the country’s GDP growth. As debt grows, the
national savings rate will decline, leaving less available in financial
capital for private investment. The impact of chronically large budget
deficits is as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>As the population ages, there will be an increasing demand for
government services that may cause higher government deficits.
Government borrowing and its interest payments will pull resources
away from domestic investment in human capital and physical capital
that is essential to economic growth.</p></li>
<li><p>Interest rates may start to rise so that the cost of financing
government debt will rise as well, creating pressure on the
government to reduce its budget deficits through spending cuts and
tax increases. These steps will be politically painful, and they
will also have a contractionary effect on aggregate demand in the
economy.</p></li>
<li><p>Rising percentage of debt to GDP will create uncertainty in the
financial and global markets that might cause a country to resort to
inflationary tactics to reduce the real value of the debt
outstanding. This will decrease real wealth and damage confidence in
the country’s ability to manage its spending. After all, if the
government has borrowed at a fixed interest rate of, say, 5%, and it
lets inflation rise above that 5%, then it will effectively be able
to repay its debt at a negative real interest rate.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The conventional reasoning suggests that the relationship between
sustained deficits that lead to high levels of government debt and
long-term growth is negative. How significant this relationship is, how
big an issue it is compared to other macroeconomic issues, and the
direction of causality, is less clear.</p>
<p>What remains important to acknowledge is that the relationship between
debt and growth is negative and that for some countries, the
relationship may be stronger than in others. It is also important to
acknowledge the direction of causality: does high debt cause slow
growth, slow growth cause high debt, or are both high debt and slow
growth the result of third factors? In our analysis, we have argued
simply that high debt causes slow</p>
<p>growth. There may be more to this debate than we have space to discuss
here.</p>
<p>Using Fiscal Policy to Address Trade Imbalances</p>
<p>If a nation is experiencing the inflow of foreign investment capital
associated with a trade deficit because foreign investors are making
long-term direct investments in firms, there may be no substantial
reason for concern. After all, many low-income nations around the world
would welcome direct investment by multinational firms that ties them
more closely into the global networks of production and distribution of
goods and services. In this case, the inflows of foreign investment
capital and the trade deficit are attracted by the opportunities for a
good rate of return on private sector investment in an economy.</p>
<p>However, governments should beware of a sustained pattern of high budget
deficits and high trade deficits. The danger arises in particular when
the inflow of foreign investment capital is not funding long-term
physical capital investment by firms, but instead is short-term
portfolio investment in government bonds. When inflows of foreign
financial investment reach high levels, foreign financial investors will
be on the alert for any reason to fear that the country’s exchange rate
may decline or the government may be unable to repay what it has
borrowed on time. Just as a few falling rocks can trigger an avalanche;
a relatively small piece of bad news about an economy can trigger an
enormous outflow of short-term financial capital.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_382.png" width="624" height="46" alt="image" />
<p>Financing Higher Education</p>
<p>Between 1982 and 2012, the increases in the cost of a college education
had far outpaced that of the income of the typical American family.
According to President Obama’s research staff, the cost of education at
a four-year public college increased by 257% compared to an increase in
family incomes of only 16% over the prior 30 years. The ongoing debate
over a balanced budget and proposed cutbacks accentuated the need to
increase investment in human capital to grow the economy versus
deepening the already significant debt levels of the U.S. government. In
summer 2013, President Obama presented a plan to make college more
affordable that included increasing Pell Grant awards and the number of
recipients, caps on interest rates for student loans, and providing
education tax credits. In addition, the plan includes an accountability
method for institutions of higher education that focuses on completion
rates and creates a College Scorecard. Whether or not all these
initiatives come to fruition remains to be seen, but they are indicative
of creative approaches that government can take to meet its obligation
from both a public and fiscal policy perspective.</p>
<p>Reducing a nation’s budget deficit will not always be a successful
method of reducing its trade deficit, because other elements of the
national saving and investment identity, like private saving or
investment, may change instead. In those cases when the budget deficit
is the main cause of the trade deficit, governments should take steps to
reduce their budget deficits, lest they make their economy vulnerable to
a rapid outflow of international financial capital that could bring a
deep recession.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Apply Ricardian equivalence to evaluate how government borrowing
affects private saving</p></li>
<li><p>Interpret a graphic representation of Ricardian equivalence</p>
<p>A change in government budgets may impact private saving.
Imagine that people watch government budgets and adjust their
savings accordingly. For example, whenever the government runs a
budget deficit, people might reason: “Well, a higher budget
deficit means that I’m just going to owe more taxes in the
future to pay off all that government borrowing, so I’ll start
saving now.” If the government runs budget surpluses, people
might reason: “With these budget surpluses (or lower budget
deficits), interest rates are falling, so that saving is less
attractive. Moreover, with</p>
<p>a budget surplus the country will be able to afford a tax cut
sometime in the future. I won’t bother saving as much now.”</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1496">The theory that rational private
households might shift their saving to offset government saving
or borrowing is known as</span> <strong>Ricardian equivalence</strong>
because the idea has intellectual roots in the writings of the
early nineteenth- century economist David Ricardo (1772–1823).
If Ricardian equivalence holds completely true, then in the
national saving and investment identity, any change in budget
deficits or budget surpluses would be completely offset by a
corresponding change in private saving. As a result, changes in
government borrowing would have no effect at all on either
physical capital investment or trade balances.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1497" class="s34">In practice, the private sector only sometimes and partially adjusts its savings behavior to offset government budget deficits and surpluses.</a>
<a href="#bookmark1497" class="a">Figure 18.6</a> <span
class="p">shows the patterns of U.S. government budget deficits
and surpluses and the rate of private saving—which includes
saving by both households and firms—since 1980. The connection
between the two is not at all obvious. In the mid-1980s, for
example, government budget deficits were quite large, but there
is no corresponding surge of private saving. However, when
budget deficits turn to surpluses in the late 1990s, there is a
simultaneous decline in private saving. When budget deficits get
very large in 2008 and 2009, there is some sign of a rise in
saving. A variety of statistical studies based on the U.S.
experience suggests that when government borrowing increases by
$1, private saving rises by about 30 cents. A World Bank study
from the late 1990s, looking at government budgets and private
saving behavior in countries around the world, found a similar
result.</span></p>

Private Savings</span> <span class="s37">The theory of Ricardian

any increase in government borrowing, while reduced private

Economic Data)</span></p>
<p>Private saving does increase to some extent when governments run
large budget deficits, and private saving falls when governments
reduce deficits or run large budget surpluses. However, the
offsetting effects of private saving compared to government
borrowing are much less than one-to-one. In addition, this
effect can vary a great deal from country to country, from time
to time, and over the short and the long run.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1498">If the funding for a larger budget
deficit comes from international financial investors, then a
trade deficit may accompany a budget deficit. In some countries,
this pattern of</span> <strong>twin deficits</strong> has set the stage for
international financial investors first to send their funds to a
country and cause an appreciation of its exchange rate and then
to pull their funds out and cause a depreciation of the exchange
rate and a financial crisis as well. It depends on whether
funding comes from international financial investors.</p>

<li><p>Explain crowding out and its effect on physical capital
investment</p></li>
<li><p>Explain the relationship between budget deficits and interest
rates</p></li>
<li><p>Identify why economic growth is tied to investments in physical

</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The underpinnings of economic growth are investments in physical
capital, human capital, and technology, all set in an economic
environment where firms and individuals can react to the incentives
provided by well-functioning markets and flexible prices. Government
borrowing can reduce the financial capital available for private firms
to invest in physical capital. However, government spending can also
encourage certain elements of long-term growth, such as spending on
roads or water systems, on education, or on research and development
that creates new technology.</p>
<p>Crowding Out Physical Capital Investment</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1500">A larger budget deficit will increase demand for
financial capital. If private saving and the trade balance remain the
same, then less financial capital will be available for private
investment in physical capital. When government borrowing soaks up
available financial capital and leaves less for private investment in
physical capital, economists call the result crowding out.</span><span

<p>To understand the potential impact of crowding out, consider the U.S.
economy’s situation before the exceptional circumstances of the
recession that started in late 2007. In 2005, for example, the budget
deficit was roughly 4% of GDP. Private investment by firms in the U.S.
economy has hovered in the range of 14% to 18% of GDP in recent decades.
However, in any given year, roughly half of U.S. investment in physical
capital just replaces machinery and equipment that has worn out or
become technologically obsolete. Only about half represents an increase
in the total quantity of physical capital in the economy. Investment in
new physical capital in any year is about 7% to 9% of GDP. In this
situation, even U.S. budget deficits in the range of 4% of GDP can
potentially crowd out a substantial share of new investment spending.
Conversely, a smaller budget deficit (or an increased budget surplus)
increases the pool of financial capital available for private
investment.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1502" class="a">Figure 18.7</a> <span class="p">shows
the patterns of U.S. budget deficits and private investment since 1980.
If greater government deficits lead to less private investment in
physical capital, and reduced government deficits or budget surpluses
lead to more investment in physical capital, these two lines should move
up and down simultaneously. This pattern occurred in the late 1990s and
early 2000s. The U.S. federal budget went from a deficit of 2.2% of GDP
in 1995 to a budget surplus of 2.4% of GDP in 2000—a swing of 4.6% of
GDP. From 1995 to 2000, private investment in physical capital rose from
15% to 18% of GDP—a rise of 3% of GDP. Then, when the U.S. government
again started running budget deficits in the early 2000s, less financial
capital became available for private investment, and the rate of private
investment fell back to about 15% of GDP by 2003.</span></p>

<p><span id="bookmark1502">Figure 18.7 U.S. Budget Deficits/Surpluses and
Private Investment</span> <span class="s37">The connection between
private savings and flows of international capital plays a role in
budget deficits and surpluses. Consequently, government borrowing and
private investment sometimes rise and fall together. For example, the
1990s show a pattern in which reduced government borrowing helped to
reduce crowding out so that more funds were available for private
investment.</span></p>
<p>This argument does not claim that a government’s budget deficits will
exactly shadow its national rate of private investment; after all, we
must account for private saving and inflows of foreign financial
investment. In the mid-1980s, for example, government budget deficits
increased substantially without a corresponding drop off in private
investment. In 2009, nonresidential private fixed investment dropped by
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(300 billion from its previous level of \)</span>1,941 billion in 2008,
primarily because, during a recession, firms lack both the funds and the
incentive to invest. Investment growth between 2009 and 2014 averaged
approximately 5.9% to $2,210.5 billion—only slightly above its 2008
level, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. During that same
period, interest rates dropped from 3.94% to less than a quarter percent
as the Federal Reserve took dramatic action to prevent a depression by
increasing the money supply through lowering short-term interest rates.
The “crowding out” of private investment due to government borrowing to
finance expenditures appears to have been suspended during the Great
Recession. However, as the economy improves and interest rates rise,
government borrowing may potentially create pressure on interest rates.</p>
<p>The Interest Rate Connection</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1504" id="bookmark1503" class="s34">Assume that government borrowing of substantial amounts will have an effect on the quantity of private investment. How will this affect interest rates in financial markets? In</a>
<a href="#bookmark1504" class="a">Figure</a> <span
class="s54">18.8</span>, the original equilibrium (E<span
class="s60">0</span>) where the demand curve (D<span
class="s60">0</span>) for financial capital intersects with the supply
curve (S<span class="s60">0</span>) occurs at an interest rate of 5% and
an equilibrium quantity equal to 20% of GDP. However, as the government
budget deficit increases, the demand curve for financial capital shifts
from D<span class="s60">0</span> to D<span class="s60">1</span>. The new
equilibrium (E<span class="s60">1</span>) occurs at an interest rate of
6% and an equilibrium quantity of 21% of GDP.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_386.jpg" width="235" height="211" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark1504"><span class="s36">Figure 18.8 Budget Deficits
and Interest Rates </span></span>In the financial market, an increase in
government borrowing can shift the demand curve for financial capital to
the right from D<span class="s63">0</span> to D<span
class="s63">1</span>. As the equilibrium interest rate shifts from
E<span class="s63">0</span> to E<span class="s63">1</span>, the interest
rate rises from 5% to 6% in this example. The higher interest rate is
one economic mechanism by which government borrowing can crowd out
private investment.</p>
<p>A survey of economic studies on the connection between government
borrowing and interest rates in the U.S. economy suggests that an
increase of 1% in the budget deficit will lead to a rise in interest
rates of between 0.5 and 1.0%, other factors held equal. In turn, a
higher interest rate tends to discourage firms from making physical
capital investments. One reason government budget deficits crowd out
private investment, therefore, is the increase in interest rates. There
are, however, economic studies that show a limited connection between
the two (at least in the United States), but as the budget deficit
grows, the dangers of rising interest rates become more real.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1505">At this point, you may wonder about the Federal
Reserve. After all, can the Federal Reserve not use expansionary
monetary policy to reduce interest rates, or in this case, to prevent
interest rates from rising? This useful question emphasizes the
importance of considering how fiscal and monetary policies work in
relation to each other. Imagine a central bank faced with a government
that is running large budget deficits, causing a rise in interest rates
and crowding out private investment. If the budget deficits are
increasing aggregate demand when the economy is already producing near
potential GDP, threatening an inflationary increase in price levels, the
central bank may react with a contractionary monetary policy. In this
situation, the higher interest rates from the government borrowing would
be made even higher by contractionary monetary policy, and the
government borrowing might crowd out a great deal of private
investment.</span><span id="bookmark1506">‌</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark1507">Alternatively, if the budget deficits are
increasing aggregate demand when the economy is producing substantially
less than potential GDP, an inflationary increase in the price level is
not much of a danger and the central bank might react with expansionary
monetary policy. In this situation, higher interest rates from
government borrowing would be largely offset by lower interest rates
from expansionary monetary policy, and there would be little crowding
out of private investment.</span></p>
<p>However, even a central bank cannot erase the overall message of the
national savings and investment identity. If government borrowing rises,
then private investment must fall, or private saving must rise, or the
trade deficit must fall. By reacting with contractionary or expansionary
monetary policy, the central bank can only help to determine which of
these outcomes is likely.</p>
<p>Public Investment in Physical Capital</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1508" class="s34">Government can invest in physical capital directly: roads and bridges; water supply and sewers; seaports and airports; schools and hospitals; plants that generate electricity, like hydroelectric dams or windmills; telecommunications facilities; and military weapons. In 2014, the U.S. federal government budget for Fiscal Year 2014 shows that the United States spent about $92 billion on transportation, including highways, mass transit, and airports.</a>

<p>Table 18.1 Grants for Major Physical Capital Investment, 2014</p>
<p>Public physical capital investment of this sort can increase the
economy’s output and productivity. An economy with reliable roads and
electricity will be able to produce more. However, it is hard to
quantify how much government investment in physical capital will benefit
the economy, because government responds to political as well as
economic incentives. When a firm makes an investment in physical
capital, it is subject to the discipline of the market: If it does not
receive a positive return on investment, the firm may lose money or even
go out of business.</p>
<p>In some cases, lawmakers make investments in physical capital as a way
of spending money in key politicians’ districts. The result may be
unnecessary roads or office buildings. Even if a project is useful and
necessary, it might be done in a way that is excessively costly, because
local contractors who make campaign contributions to politicians
appreciate the extra business. Alternatively, governments sometimes do
not make the investments they should because a decision to spend on
infrastructure does not need to just make economic sense. It must be
politically popular as well. Managing public investment cost-effectively
can be difficult.</p>
<p>If a government decides to finance an investment in public physical
capital with higher taxes or lower government spending in other areas,
it need not worry that it is directly crowding out private investment.
Indirectly however, higher household taxes could cut down on the level
of private savings available and have a similar effect. If a government
decides to finance an investment in public physical capital by
borrowing, it may end up increasing the quantity of public physical
capital at the cost of crowding out investment in private physical
capital, which could be more beneficial to the economy.</p>
<p>Public Investment in Human Capital</p>
<p>In most countries, the government plays a large role in society’s
investment in human capital through the education system. A highly
educated and skilled workforce contributes to a higher rate of economic
growth. For the low-income nations of the world, additional investment
in human capital seems likely to increase productivity and growth. For
the United States, critics have raised tough questions about how much
increases in government spending on education will improve the actual
level of education.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1509" class="s34">Among economists, discussions of education reform often begin with some uncomfortable facts. As</a>
<a href="#bookmark1509" class="a">Figure</a> 18.9 <span class="p">shows,
spending per student for kindergarten through grade 12 (K–12) increased
substantially in real dollars through 2010. The U.S. Census Bureau
reports that current spending per pupil for elementary and secondary
education rose from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(5,001 in 1998 to \)</span>10,608 in 2012. However, as
measured by standardized tests like the SAT, the level of student
academic achievement has barely budged in recent decades. On
international tests, U.S. students lag behind students from many other
countries. (Of course, test scores are an imperfect measure of education
for a variety of reasons. It would be difficult, however, to argue that
there are not real problems in the U.S. education system and that the
tests are just inaccurate.)</span></p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_387.jpg" width="433" height="230" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark1509">Figure 18.9 Total Spending for Elementary,
Secondary, and Vocational Education (1998–2014) in the United
States</span> <span class="s37">The graph shows that government spending
on education was continually increasing up until 2006 where it leveled
off until 2008 when it increased dramatically. Since 2010, spending has
steadily decreased. (Source: Office of Management and Budget)</span></p>
<p>The fact that increased financial resources have not brought greater
measurable gains in student performance has led some education experts
to question whether the problems may be due to structure, not just to
the resources spent.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1510">Other government programs seek to increase human
capital either before or after the K–12 education system. Programs for
early childhood education, like the federal</span> <strong>Head Start
program</strong>, are directed at families where the parents may have limited
educational and financial resources. Government also offers substantial
support for universities and colleges. For example, in the United States
about 60% of students take at least a few college or university classes
beyond the high school level. In Germany and Japan, about half of all
students take classes beyond the comparable high school level. In the
countries of Latin America, only about one student in four takes classes
beyond the high school level, and in the nations of sub-Saharan Africa,
only about one student in 20.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1511">Not all spending on educational human capital
needs to happen through the government: many college students in the
United States pay a substantial share of the cost of their education. If
low-income countries of the world are going to experience a widespread
increase in their education levels for grade-school children, government
spending seems likely to play a substantial role. For the U.S. economy,
and for other high-income countries, the primary focus at this time is
more on how to get a bigger return from existing spending on education
and how to improve the performance of the average high school graduate,
rather than dramatic increases in education spending.</span></p>
<p>How Fiscal Policy Can Improve Technology</p>
<p>Research and development (R&amp;D) efforts are the lifeblood of new
technology. According to the National Science Foundation, federal
outlays for research, development, and physical plant improvements to
various governmental agencies have remained at an average of 8.8% of
GDP. About one-fifth of U.S. R&amp;D spending goes to defense and
space-oriented research. Although defense-oriented R&amp;D spending may
sometimes produce consumer-oriented spinoffs, R&amp;D that is aimed at
producing new weapons is less likely to benefit the civilian economy
than direct civilian R&amp;D spending.</p>
<p>Fiscal policy can encourage R&amp;D using either direct spending or tax
policy. Government could spend more on the R&amp;D that it carries out in
government laboratories, as well as expanding federal R&amp;D grants to
universities and colleges, nonprofit organizations, and the private
sector. By 2014, the federal share of R&amp;D outlays totaled $135.5
billion, or about 4% of the federal government’s total budget outlays,
according to data from the National Science Foundation. Fiscal policy
can also support R&amp;D through tax incentives, which allow firms to reduce
their tax bill as they increase spending on research and development.</p>
<p>Summary of Fiscal Policy, Investment, and Economic Growth</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1512" class="s34">Investment in physical capital, human capital, and new technology is essential for long-term economic growth, as</a>
<a href="#bookmark1512" class="a">Table 18.2</a> <span
class="p">summarizes. In a market-oriented economy, private firms will
undertake most of the investment in physical capital, and fiscal policy
should seek to avoid a long series of outsized budget deficits that
might crowd out</span></p>
<p>such investment. We will see the effects of many growth-oriented
policies very gradually over time, as students are better educated, we
make physical capital investments, and man invents and implements new

<ol>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark1484" class="a">How Government Borrowing Affects Investment and the Trade</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark1484">Balance</a></p>
<p>A change in any part of the national saving and investment identity
suggests that if the government budget deficit changes, then either
private savings, private investment in physical capital, or the
trade balance—or some combination of the three—must change as well.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark1490" class="a">Fiscal Policy and the Trade</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark1490">Balance</a></p>
<p>The government need not balance its budget every year. However, a
sustained pattern of large budget deficits over time risks causing
several negative macroeconomic outcomes: a shift to the right in
aggregate demand that causes an inflationary increase in the price
level; crowding out private investment in physical capital in a way
that slows down economic growth; and creating a dependence on
inflows of international portfolio investment which can sometimes
turn into outflows of foreign financial investment that can be
injurious to a macroeconomy.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark1495" class="a">How Government Borrowing Affects Private</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark1495">Saving</a></p>
<p>The theory of Ricardian equivalence holds that changes in private
saving will offset changes in government borrowing or saving. Thus,
greater private saving will offset higher budget deficits, while
greater private borrowing will offset larger budget surpluses. If
the theory holds true, then changes in government borrowing or
saving would have no effect on private investment in physical
capital or on the trade balance. However, empirical evidence
suggests that the theory holds true only partially.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark1499" class="a">Fiscal Policy, Investment, and Economic</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark1499">Growth</a></p></li>
</ol>
<p>Economic growth comes from a combination of investment in physical
capital, human capital, and technology. Government borrowing can crowd
out private sector investment in physical capital, but fiscal policy can
also increase investment in publicly owned physical capital, human
capital (education), and research and development. Possible methods for
improving education and society’s investment in human capital include
spending more money on teachers and other educational resources, and
reorganizing the education system to provide greater incentives for
success. Methods for increasing research and development spending to
generate new technology include direct government spending on R&amp;D and
tax incentives for businesses to conduct additional R&amp;D.</p>

<li><p>Sketch a diagram of how a budget deficit causes a trade deficit.
(<em>Hint</em>: Begin with what will happen to the exchange rate when
foreigners demand more U.S. government debt.)</p></li>
<li><p>Sketch a diagram of how sustained budget deficits cause low economic
growth.</p></li>
<li><p>Assume that the newly independent government of Tanzania employed
you in 1964. Now free from British rule, the Tanzanian parliament
has decided that it will spend 10 million shillings on schools,
roads, and healthcare for the year. You estimate that the net taxes
for the year are eight million shillings. The government will
finance the difference by selling 10-year government bonds at 12%
interest per year. Parliament must add the interest on outstanding
bonds to government expenditure each year. Assume that Parliament
places additional taxes to finance this increase in government
expenditure so the gap between government spending is always two
million. If the school, road, and healthcare budget are unchanged,
compute the value of the accumulated debt in 10 years.</p></li>
<li><p>Illustrate the concept of Ricardian equivalence using the demand and
supply of financial capital graph.</p></li>
<li><p>During the most recent recession, some economists argued that the
change in the interest rates that comes about due to deficit
spending implied in the demand and supply of financial capital graph
would not occur. A simple reason was that the government was
stepping in to invest when private firms were not. Using a graph,
explain how the use by government in investment offsets the deficit
demand.</p></li>

<p>Youth Unemployment: Three Cases</p>
<p>Chad Harding, a young man from Cape Town, South Africa, completed school
having done well on his exams. He had high hopes for the future. Like
many young South Africans, however, he had difficulty finding a job. “I
was just stuck at home waiting, waiting for something to come up,” he
said in a BBC interview in 2012. In South Africa 54.6% of young females
and 47.2% of males are unemployed. In fact, the problem is not limited
to South Africa. Seventy-three million of the world’s youth aged 15 to
24 are currently unemployed, according to the International Labour
Organization.</p>
<p>According to the <em>Wall Street Journal,</em> in India, 60% of the labor force
is self-employed, largely because of labor market regulation. A recent
World Bank World Development Report says that India’s unemployed youth
accounted for 9.9% of the youth work force in 2010. In Spain (a far
richer country) in the same year, the female/male youth unemployment
rate was 39.8% and 43.2% respectively.</p>
<p>Youth unemployment is a significant issue in many parts of the world.
However, despite the apparent</p>
<p>Unemployment is an issue that has different causes in different
countries, and is especially severe in the low- and middle-income
economies around the world. (Credit: modification of work by Daniel
Ramirez/Flickr Creative Commons)</p>
<p>similarities in rates between South Africa, Spain, and India,
macroeconomic policy solutions to decrease youth unemployment in these
three countries are different. This chapter will look at macroeconomic
policies around the world, specifically those related to reducing
unemployment, promoting economic growth, and stable inflation and
exchange rates. Then we will look again at the three cases of South
Africa, Spain, and India.</p>

<p>The Diversity of Countries and Economies across the World</p>
<p>Improving Countries’ Standards of Living</p>
<p>Causes of Unemployment around the World</p>
<p>Causes of Inflation in Various Countries and Regions</p>
<p>Balance of Trade Concerns</p>
<p>There are extraordinary differences in the composition and performance
of economies across the world. What explains these differences? Are
countries motivated by similar goals when it comes to macroeconomic
policy? Can we apply the same macroeconomic framework that we developed
in this text to understand the performance of these countries? Let’s
take each of these questions in turn.</p>
<p>Explaining
differences<a href="#bookmark619" class="s34">: Recall from</a> <span
class="s54">Unemployment </span><span class="p">that we explained the
difference in composition and performance of economies by appealing to
an aggregate production function. We argued that differences in
productivity explain the diversity of average incomes across the world,
which in turn were affected by inputs such as capital deepening, human
capital, and “technology.” Every economy has its own distinctive
economic characteristics, institutions, history, and political
realities, which imply that access to these “ingredients” will vary by
country and so will economic performance.</span></p>
<p>For example, South Korea invested heavily in education and technology to
increase agricultural productivity in the early 1950s. Some of this
investment came from its historical relationship with the United States.
As a result of these and many other institutions, its economy has
managed to converge to the levels of income in leading economies like
Japan and the United States.</p>

<p>Similar goals and
frameworks<a href="#bookmark432" class="s34">: Many economies that have performed well in terms of per capita income have—for better or worse—been motivated by a similar goal: to maintain the quality of life of their citizens. Quality of life is a broad term, but as you can imagine it includes but is not limited to such things as low level of unemployment, price stability (low levels of inflation), and the ability to trade. These seem to be universal macroeconomic goals as we discussed in</a>
<a href="#bookmark432" class="a">The Macroeconomic</a> <span
class="s54">Perspective</span><span class="p">. No country would argue
against them. To study macroeconomic policy around the world, we begin
by comparing standards of living. In keeping with these goals, we also
look at indicators such as unemployment, inflation, and the balance of
trade policies across countries. Remember that every country has had a
diverse set of experiences; therefore although our goals may be similar,
each country may well require macroeconomic policies tailored to its
circumstances.</span></p>

<p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Analyze GDP per capita as a measure of the diversity of
international standards of living</p></li>
<li><p>Identify what classifies a country as low-income, middle-income,
or high-income</p></li>
<li><p>Explain how geography, demographics, industry structure, and
economic institutions influence standards of living</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark432" id="bookmark1532" class="s34">The national economies that comprise the global economy are remarkably diverse. Let us use one key indicator of the standard of living, GDP per capita, to quantify this diversity. You will quickly see that quantifying this diversity is fraught with challenges and limitations. As we explained in</a>
<a href="#bookmark432" class="a">The Macroeconomic</a>
Perspective<a href="#bookmark1285" class="s34">, we must consider using purchasing power parity or “international dollars” to convert average incomes into comparable units. Purchasing power parity, as we formally defined in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1285" class="a">Exchange Rates and International Capital</a>
Flows<span class="p">, takes into account that prices of the
same good are different across countries.</span><span
id="bookmark1533">‌</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark432" class="a">The Macroeconomic Perspective</a>
<a href="#bookmark537" class="s34">explained how to measure GDP, the challenges of using GDP to compare standards of living, and the difficulty of confusing economic size with distribution. In China’s case, for example, China ranks as the second largest global economy, second to only the United States, with Japan ranking third. However, when we take China’s GDP of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(9.2 trillion and divide it by its population of 1.4 billion, then the per capita GDP is only \)</span>6,900, which is significantly lower than that of Japan, at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(38,500, and that of the United States, at \)</span>52,800. Measurement issues aside, it’s worth repeating that the goal, then, is to not only increase GDP, but to strive toward increased GDP per capita to increase overall living standards for individuals. As we have learned from</a>
<a href="#bookmark537" class="a">Economic</a> Growth<span
class="p">, countries can achieve this at the national level by
designing policies that increase worker productivity, deepen
capital, and advance technology.</span></p>
<p>GDP per capita also allows us to rank countries into high-,
middle-, or low-income groups. Low-income countries are those
with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1,025 per capita GDP per year; middle-income countries

<p><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/standofliving" class="s84">Economists know that there are many factors that contribute to your standard of living. People in high-income countries may have very little time due to heavy workloads and may feel disconnected from their community. Lower-income countries may be more community centered, but have little in the way of material wealth.</a>
It is hard to measure these characteristics of standard of living. The
Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development has developed the
“OECD Better Life Index.” Visit this
<a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/" class="s41">website</a>
<a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/standofliving" class="s41">(http://openstaxcollege.org/ l/standofliving)</a>
to see how countries measure up to your expected standard of living.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1538">Such comparisons between regions are admittedly
rough. After all, per capita GDP cannot fully capture the quality of
life. Many other factors have a large impact on the standard of living,
like health, education, human rights, crime and personal safety, and
environmental quality. These measures also reveal very wide differences
in the standard of living across the regions of the world. Much of this
is correlated with per capita income, but there are exceptions. For
example, life expectancy at birth in many low-income regions
approximates those who are more affluent. The data also illustrate that
nobody can claim to have perfect standards of living. For instance,
despite very high income levels, there is still undernourishment in
Europe and North America.</span></p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_395.png" width="624" height="160" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark1539">The differences in economic statistics and other
measures of well-being, substantial though they are, do not fully
capture the reasons for the enormous differences between countries.
Aside from the neoclassical determinants of growth, four additional
determinants are significant in a wide range of statistical studies and
are worth mentioning: geography, demography, industrial structure, and
institutions.</span></p>
<p>Geographic and Demographic Differences</p>
<p>Countries have geographic differences: some have extensive coastlines,
some are landlocked. Some have large rivers that have been a path of
commerce for centuries, or mountains that have been a barrier to trade.
Some have deserts, some have rain forests. These differences create
different positive and negative opportunities for commerce, health, and
the environment.</p>
<p>Countries also have considerable differences in the age distribution of
the population. Many high-income nations are approaching a situation by
2020 or so in which the elderly will form a much larger share of the
population. Most low- income countries still have a higher proportion of
youth and young adults, but by about 2050, the elderly populations in
these low-income countries are expected to boom as well. These
demographic changes will have considerable impact on the standard of
living of the young and the old.</p>
<p>Differences in Industry Structure and Economic Institutions</p>
<p>Countries have differences in industry structure. In the world’s
high-income economies, only about 2% of GDP comes from agriculture; the
average for the rest of the world is 12%. Countries have strong
differences in degree of urbanization.</p>
<p>Countries also have strong differences in economic institutions: some
nations have economies that are extremely market-oriented, while other
nations have command economies. Some nations are open to international
trade, while others use tariffs and import quotas to limit the impact of
trade. Some nations are torn by long-standing armed conflicts; other
nations are largely at peace. There are also differences in political,
religious, and social institutions.</p>
<p>No nation intentionally aims for a low standard of living, high rates of
unemployment and inflation, or an unsustainable trade imbalance.
However, nations will differ in their priorities and in the situations
in which they find themselves, and so their policy choices can
reasonably vary, too. The next modules will discuss how nations around
the world, from high income to low income, approach the four
macroeconomic goals of economic growth, low unemployment, low inflation,
and a sustainable balance of trade.</p>

What is the origin of economic growth? According to most
economists who believe in the</span> <strong>growth
consensus</strong><a href="#bookmark537" class="s34">, economic growth (as we discussed in</a>
<a href="#bookmark537" class="a">Economic</a> <span
class="s54">Growth</span>) is built on a foundation</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1537" class="s34">of productivity improvements. In turn, productivity increases are the result of greater human and physical capital and technology, all interacting in a market-driven economy. In the pursuit of economic growth, however, some countries and regions start from different levels, as the differences in per capita GDP presented earlier in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1537" class="a">Table 19.2</a> <span
class="p">illustrate.</span></p>
<p>Growth Policies for the High-Income Countries</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark856" class="s34">For the high-income countries, the challenge of economic growth is to push continually for a more educated workforce that can create, invest in, and apply new technologies. In effect, the goal of their growth-oriented public policy is to shift their aggregate supply curves to the right (refer to</a>
<a href="#bookmark856" class="a">The Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply</a>
Model<span class="p">). The main public policies targeted at
achieving this goal are fiscal policies focused on investment,
including investment in human capital, in technology, and in
physical plant and equipment. These countries also recognize
that economic growth works best in a stable and market-oriented
economic climate. For this reason, they use monetary policy to
keep inflation low and stable, and to minimize the risk of
exchange rate fluctuations, while also encouraging domestic and
international competition.</span></p>
<p>However, early in the second decade of the 2000s, many
high-income countries found themselves more focused on the short
term than on the long term. The United States, Western Europe,
and Japan all experienced a combination of financial crisis and
deep recession, and the after-effects of the recession—like high
unemployment rates—seemed likely to linger for several years.
Most of these governments took aggressive, and in some cases
controversial, steps to jump-start their economies by running
very large budget deficits as part of expansionary fiscal
policy. These countries must adopt a course that combines lower
government spending and higher taxes.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1542" class="s34">Similarly, many central banks ran highly expansionary monetary policies, with both near-zero interest rates and unconventional loans and investments. For example, in 2012, Shinzo Abe (see</a>
<a href="#bookmark1542" class="a">Figure</a> <span
class="s54">19.4</span>), then newly-elected Prime Minister of
Japan, unveiled a plan to pull his country out of its
two-decade-long slump in economic growth. It included both
fiscal stimulus and an increase in the money supply. The plan
was quite successful in the short run. However, according to the
<em>Economist</em>, with public debt “expected to approach 240% of
GDP,” (as of 2012 it was 226% of GDP) printing money and
public-works spending were only short-term solutions.</p>

<p>As we discussed in other chapters, macroeconomics needs to have
both a short-run and a long-run focus. The challenge for many of
the developed countries in the next few years will be to exit
from the short-term policies that they used to correct the
2008–2009 recession. Since the return to growth has been
sluggish, it has been politically challenging for these
governments to refocus their efforts on new technology,
education, and physical capital investment.</p>
<p>Growth Policies for the Middle-Income Economies</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1543">The world’s great economic success
stories in the last few decades began in the 1970s with that
group of nations sometimes known as the</span> <strong>East Asian
Tigers</strong>: South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and
Singapore. The list sometimes includes Hong Kong and Taiwan,
although often under international law they are treated as part
of China, rather than as separate countries. The economic growth
of the Tigers has been phenomenal, typically averaging 5.5% real
per capita growth for several decades. In the 1980s, other
countries began to show signs of convergence. China began
growing rapidly, often at annual rates of 8% to 10% per year.
India began growing rapidly, first at rates of about 5% per year
in the 1990s, but then higher still in the first decade of the
2000s.</p>
<p>We know the underlying causes of these rapid growth rates:</p>
</li>
<li><p>China and the East Asian Tigers, in particular, have been among
the highest savers in the world, often saving one-third or more
of GDP as compared to the roughly one-fifth of GDP, which would
be a more typical saving rate in Latin America and Africa. These
countries harnessed higher savings for domestic investment to
build physical capital.</p></li>
<li><p>These countries had policies that supported heavy investments in
human capital, first building up primary- level education and
then expanding secondary-level education. Many focused on
encouraging math and science education, which is useful in
engineering and business.</p></li>
<li><p>Governments made a concerted effort to seek out applicable
technology, by sending students and government commissions
abroad to look at the most efficient industrial operations
elsewhere. They also created policies to support innovative
companies that wished to build production facilities to take
advantage of the abundant and inexpensive human capital.</p></li>
<li><p>China and India in particular also allowed far greater freedom
for market forces, both within their own domestic economies and
also in encouraging their firms to participate in world markets.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_397.png" width="624" height="51" alt="image" />
<p>What is the rule of 72?</p>
<p>It is worth pausing a moment to marvel at the East Asian Tigers’
growth rates. If per capita GDP grows at, say, 6% per year, then
you can apply the formula for compound growth rates—that is (1 +
0.06)<span class="s65">30</span>—meaning a nation’s level of per
capita GDP will rise by a multiple of almost six over 30 years.
Another strategy is to apply the rule of 72. The rule of 72 is
an approximation to figure out doubling time. We divide the rule
number, 72, by the annual growth rate to obtain the approximate
number of years it will take for income to double. If we have a
6% growth rate, it will take 72/6, or 12 years, for incomes to
double. Using this rule here suggests that a Tiger that grows at
6% will double its GDP every 12 years. In contrast, a
technological leader, chugging along with per capita growth
rates of about 2% per year, would double its income in 36 years.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1544">This combination of technology, human
capital, and physical capital, combined with the incentives of a
market- oriented economic context, proved an extremely powerful
stimulant to growth. Challenges that these middle-income
countries faced are a legacy of government economic controls
that for political reasons can be dismantled only slowly over
time. In many of them, the government heavily regulates the
banking and financial sector. Governments have also sometimes
selected certain industries to receive low-interest loans or
government subsidies. These economies have found that an
increased dose of market-oriented incentives for firms and
workers has been a critical ingredient in the recipe for faster
growth. To learn more about measuring economic growth, read the
following Clear It Up feature.</span></p>
<p>Growth Policies for Economically-Challenged Countries</p>
<p>Many economically-challenged or low-income countries are
geographically located in Sub-Saharan Africa. Other pockets of
low income are in the former Soviet Bloc, and in parts of
Central America and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>There are macroeconomic policies and prescriptions that might
alleviate the extreme poverty and low standard of living.
However, many of these countries lack the economic and legal
stability, along with market-oriented institutions, needed to
provide a fertile climate for domestic economic growth and to
attract foreign investment. Thus, macroeconomic policies for low
income economies are vastly different from those of the high
income economies. The World Bank has made it a priority to
combat poverty and raise overall income levels through 2030. One
of the key obstacles to achieving this is the political
instability that seems to be a common feature of low-income
countries.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1545" class="a">Figure 19.5</a> <span
class="p">shows the ten lowest income countries as ranked by The
World Bank in 2013. These countries share some common traits,
the most significant of which is the recent failures of their
governments to provide a legal framework for economic growth.
Ethiopia and Eritrea recently ended a long-standing war in 2000.
Civil and ethnic wars have plagued countries such as Burundi and
Liberia. Command economies, corruption, as well as political
factionalism and infighting are commonly adopted elements in
these low-income countries. The Democratic Republic of the Congo
(often referred to as “Congo”) is a resource-wealthy country
that has not been able to increase its subsistence standard of
living due to the political environment.</span></p>

<p><span id="bookmark1546">Low-income countries are at a
disadvantage because any incomes that people receive are spent
immediately on necessities such as food. People in these
countries live on less than <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1,035 per year, which is less than
\)</span>100 per month. Lack of saving means a lack of capital
accumulation and a lack of loanable funds for investment in
physical and human capital. Recent research by two MIT
economists, Abhijit Bannerjee and Esther Duflo, has confirmed
that the households in these economies are trapped in low
incomes because they cannot muster enough investment to push
themselves out of poverty.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1547" class="s34">For example, the average citizen of Burundi, the lowest-income country, subsists on $150 per year (adjusted to 2005 dollars). According to Central Intelligence Agency data in its CIA Factbook, as of 2013, 90% of Burundi’s population is agrarian, with coffee and tea as the main income producing crop. Only one in two children attends school and, as</a>
<a href="#bookmark1547" class="a">Figure</a> 19.6 <span
class="p">shows, many are not in schools comparable to what
occurs in developed countries. The CIA Factbook also estimates
that 15% of Burundi’s population suffers from HIV/AIDS.
Political instability has made it difficult for Burundi to make
significant headway toward growth, as verified by the
electrification of only 2% of households and 42% of its national
income coming from foreign aid.</span></p>

<p>Other low-income countries share similar stories. These
countries have found it difficult to generate investments for
themselves or to find foreign investors willing to put up the
money for more than the basic needs. Foreign aid and external
investment comprise significant portions of the income in these
economies, but are not sufficient to allow for the capital
accumulation necessary to invest in physical and human capital.
However, is foreign aid always a contributor to economic growth?
It can be a controversial issue, as the next Clear it Up feature
points out.</p>
<p>Does foreign aid to low-income countries work?</p>
<p>According to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD), about $134 billion per year in foreign aid
flows from the high-income countries of the world to the
low-income ones. Relative to the size of their populations or
economies, this is not a large amount for either donors or
recipients. For low- income countries, aid averages about 1.3
percent of their GDP. However, even this relatively small amount
has been highly controversial.</p>
<p>Supporters of additional foreign aid point to the extraordinary
human suffering in the world’s low-and middle- income countries.
They see opportunities all across Africa, Asia, and Latin
America to set up health clinics and schools. They want to help
with the task of building economic infrastructure: clean water,
plumbing, electricity, and roads. Supporters of this aid include
formal state-sponsored institutions like the United Kingdom’s
Department for International Development (DFID) or independent
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) like CARE International
that also receive donor government funds. For example, because
of an outbreak of meningitis in Ethiopia in 2010, DFID channeled
significant funds to the Ethiopian Ministry of Health to train
rural health care workers and also for vaccines. These monies
helped the Ministry offset shortfalls in their budget.</p>
<p>Opponents of increased aid do not quarrel with the goal of
reducing human suffering, but they suggest that foreign aid has
often proved a poor tool for advancing that goal. For example,
according to an article in the <em>Attaché Journal of International
Affairs</em>, the Canadian foreign aid organization (CIDA) provided
$100 million to Tanzania to grow wheat. The project did produce
wheat, but nomadic pastoralists and other villagers who had
lived on the land were driven off 100,000 acres of land to make
way for the project. The damage in terms of human rights and
lost livelihoods was significant. Villagers were beaten and
killed because some refused to leave the land. At times, the
unintended collateral damage from foreign aid can be
significant.</p>
<p>William Easterly, professor of economics at New York University
and author of <em>The White Man’s Burden</em>, argues that countries
often receive aid for political reasons and ends up doing more
harm than good. If a country’s government creates a reasonably
stable and market-oriented macroeconomic climate, then foreign
investors will be likely to provide funds for many profitable
activities. For example, according to <em>The New York Times</em>,
Facebook is partnering with multiple organizations in a project
called <a class="reference external" href="http://Internet.org">Internet.org</a> to provide access in remote and low-income
areas of the world, and Google began its own initiative called
Project Loon.</p>
<p>Facebook’s first forays into providing internet access via
mobile phones began in stable, market-oriented countries like
India, Brazil, Indonesia, Turkey, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Policymakers are now wiser about foreign aid limitations than
they were a few decades ago. In targeted and specific cases,
especially if foreign aid is channeled to long-term investment
projects, foreign aid can have a modest role to play in reducing
the extreme levels of deprivation that hundreds of millions of
people around the world experience.</p>

World</span><span id="bookmark1548">‌</span></p>
<p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Explain the nature and causes of unemployment</p></li>
<li><p>Analyze the natural rate of unemployment and the factors that
affect it</p></li>
<li><p>Identify how undeveloped labor markets can result in the same
hardships as unemployment</p>
<p>We can categorize the causes of unemployment in the world’s
high-income countries in two ways: either cyclical unemployment
caused by the economy when in a recession, or the natural rate
of unemployment caused by factors in labor markets, such as
government regulations regarding hiring and starting businesses.</p>
<p>Unemployment from a Recession</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1549">For unemployment caused by a recession,
the Keynesian economic model points out that both monetary and
fiscal policy tools are available. The monetary policy
prescription for dealing with recession is straightforward: run
an expansionary monetary policy to increase the quantity of
money and loans, drive down interest rates, and increase
aggregate demand. In a recession, there is usually relatively
little danger of inflation taking off, and so even a central
bank, with fighting inflation as its top priority, can usually
justify some reduction in interest rates.</span><span
id="bookmark1550">‌</span><span id="bookmark1551">‌</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1384" id="bookmark1552" class="s34">With regard to fiscal policy, the automatic stabilizers that we discussed in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1384" class="a">Government Budgets and Fiscal</a>
Policy <span class="p">should be allowed to work, even if this
means larger budget deficits in times of recession. There is
less agreement over whether, in addition to automatic
stabilizers, governments in a recession should try to adopt
discretionary fiscal policy of additional tax cuts or spending
increases. In the case of the Great Recession, the case for this
kind of extra-aggressive expansionary fiscal policy is stronger,
but for a smaller recession, given the time lags of implementing
fiscal policy, countries should use discretionary fiscal policy
with caution.</span><span id="bookmark1553">‌</span></p>
<p>However, the aftermath of the Recession emphasizes that
expansionary fiscal and monetary policies do not turn off a
recession like flipping a switch turns off a lamp. Even after a
recession is officially over, and positive growth has returned,
it can take some months—or even a couple of years—before
private-sector firms believe the economic climate is healthy
enough that they can expand their workforce.</p>
<p>The Natural Rate of Unemployment</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1554">Unemployment rates in European nations
have typically been higher than in the United States. In 2006,
before the start of the Great Recession, the U.S. unemployment
rate was 4.6%, compared with 9% in France, 10.4% in Germany, and
7.1% in Sweden. We can attribute the pattern of generally higher
unemployment rates in Europe, which dates back to the 1970s, to
the fact that European economies have a higher natural rate of
unemployment because they have a greater number of rules and
restrictions that discourage firms from hiring and unemployed
workers from taking jobs.</span></p>
<p>Addressing the natural rate of unemployment is straightforward
in theory but difficult in practice. Government can play a
useful role in providing unemployment and welfare payments, for
example, by passing rules about where and when businesses can
operate, and assuring that the workplace is safe. However, these
well-intentioned laws can, in some cases, become so intrusive
that businesses decide to place limits on their hiring.</p>
<p>For example, a law that imposes large costs on a business that
tries to fire or lay off workers will mean that businesses try
to avoid hiring in the first place, as is the case in France.
According to <em>Business Week</em>, “France has 2.4 times as many
companies with 49 employees as with 50 … according to the
French labor code, once a company has at least 50 employees
inside France, management must create three worker councils,
introduce profit sharing, and submit restructuring plans to the
councils if the company decides to fire workers for economic
reasons.” This labor law essentially limits employment (or
raises the natural rate of unemployment).</p>
<p>Undeveloped Labor Markets</p>
<p>Low-income and middle-income countries face employment issues
that go beyond unemployment as it is understood in the
high-income economies. A substantial number of workers in these
economies provide many of their own needs by farming, fishing,
or hunting. They barter and trade with others and may take a
succession of short-term or one-day jobs, sometimes receiving
pay with food or shelter, sometimes with money. They are not
“unemployed” in the sense that we use the term in the United
States and Europe, but neither are they employed in a regular
wage-paying job.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark14" class="s34">The starting point of economic activity, as we discussed in</a>
<a href="#bookmark14" class="a">Welcome to</a> Economics!<span
class="p">, is the division of labor, in which workers
specialize in certain tasks and trade the fruits of their labor
with others. Workers who are not connected to a labor market are
often unable to specialize very much. Because these workers are
not “officially” employed, they are often not eligible for
social benefits like unemployment insurance or old-age
payments—if such payments are even available in their country.
Helping these workers to become more connected to the labor
market and the economy is an important policy goal. Recent
research by development economists suggests that one of the key
factors in raising people in low-income countries out of the
worst kind of poverty is whether they can make a connection to a
somewhat regular wage-paying job.</span></p>

and Regions</span><span id="bookmark1555">‌</span></p>
<p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Identify the causes and effects of inflation in various economic
markets</p></li>
<li><p>Explain the significance of a converging economy</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1556">Policymakers of the high-income
economies appear to have learned some lessons about fighting
inflation. First, whatever happens with aggregate supply and
aggregate demand in the short run, countries can use monetary
policy to prevent inflation from becoming entrenched in the
economy in the medium and long term. Second, there is no
long-run gain to letting inflation become established. In fact,
allowing inflation to become lasting and persistent poses
undesirable risks and tradeoffs. When inflation is high,
businesses and individuals need to spend time and effort
worrying about protecting themselves against inflation, rather
than seeking better ways to serve customers. In short, the
high-income economies appear to have both a political consensus
to hold inflation low and the economic tools to do so.</span></p>
<p>In a number of middle- and low-income economies around the
world, inflation is far from a solved problem. In the early
2000s, Turkey experienced inflation of more than 50% per year
for several years. Belarus had inflation of about 100% per year
from 2000 to 2001. From 2008 to 2010, Venezuela and Myanmar had
inflation rates of 20% to 30%</p>
<p>per year. Indonesia, Iran, Nigeria, the Russian Federation, and
Ukraine all had double-digit inflation for most of the years
from 2000 to 2010. Zimbabwe had hyperinflation, with inflation
rates that went from more than 100% per year in the mid-2000s to
a rate of several million percent in 2008.</p>
<p>In these countries, the problem of very high inflation generally
arises from huge budget deficits, which the government finances
by printing its domestic currency. This is a case of “too much
money chasing too few goods.” In the case of Zimbabwe, the
government covered its widening deficits by printing ever higher
currency notes, including a $100 trillion bill. By late 2008,
the money was nearly worthless, which led Zimbabwe to adopt the
U.S. dollar, immediately halting their hyperinflation. In some
countries, the central bank makes loans to politically favored
firms, essentially printing money to do so, and this too leads
to higher inflation.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1557">A number of countries have managed to
sustain solid levels of economic growth for sustained periods of
time with inflation levels that would sound high by recent U.S.
standards, like 10% to 30% per year. In such economies, the
governments index most contracts, wage levels, and interest
rates to inflation. Indexing wage contracts and interest rates
means that they will increase when inflation increases to retain
purchasing power. When wages do not rise as price levels rise,
this leads to a decline in the real wage rate and a decrease in
the standard of living. Likewise, interest rates that are not
indexed mean that money lenders will receive payment in devalued
currency and will also lose purchasing power on monies that they
lent. It is clearly possible—and perhaps sometimes necessary—for
a</span> <strong>converging economy</strong> (the economy of a country that
demonstrates the ability to catch up to the technology leaders)
to live with a degree of uncertainty over inflation that would
be politically unacceptable in the high-income economies.</p>

style=" color: #3767B1;">Balance of Trade Concerns</span><span
id="bookmark1558">‌</span></p>
<p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Explain the meaning of trade balance and its implications for
the foreign exchange market</p></li>
<li><p>Analyze concerns over international trade in goods and services
and international flows of capital</p></li>
<li><p>Identify and evaluate market-oriented economic reforms</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the 1950s and 1960s, and even into the 1970s, low- and middle-income
countries often viewed openness to global flows of goods, services, and
financial capital in a negative light. These countries feared that
foreign trade would mean both economic losses as high-income trading
partners “exploited” their economy and they lost domestic political
control to powerful business interests and multinational corporations.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1559">These negative feelings about international
trade have evolved. After all, the great economic success stories of
recent years like Japan, the East Asian Tiger economies, China, and
India, all took advantage of opportunities to sell in global markets.
European economies thrive with high levels of trade. In the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the United States, Canada, and
Mexico pledged themselves to reduce trade barriers. Many countries have
clearly learned that reducing barriers to trade is at least potentially
beneficial to the economy. Many smaller world economies have learned an
even tougher lesson: if they do not participate actively in world trade,
they are unlikely to join the success stories among the converging
economies. There are no examples in world history of small economies
that remained apart from the global economy but still attained a high
standard of living.</span></p>
<p>Although almost every country now claims that its goal is to participate
in global trade, the possible negative consequences have remained highly
controversial. It is useful to divide these possible negative
consequences into issues involving trade of goods and services and
issues involving international capital flows. These issues are related,
but not the same. An economy may have a high level of trade in goods and
services relative to GDP, but if exports and imports are balanced, the
net flow of foreign investment in and out of the economy will be zero.
Conversely, an economy may have only a moderate level of trade relative
to GDP, but find that it has a substantial current account trade
imbalance. Thus, it is useful to consider the concerns over
international trade of goods and services and international flows of
financial capital separately.</p>
<p>Concerns over International Trade in Goods and Services</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark780" class="s34">There is a long list of worries about foreign trade in goods and services: fear of job loss, environmental dangers, unfair labor practices, and many other concerns. We discuss these arguments at some length in the chapter on</a>
<a href="#bookmark780" class="a">The International Trade and Capital</a>
Flows<span class="p">.</span></p>
<p>Of all of the arguments for limitations on trade, perhaps the most
controversial one among economists is the</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1659" id="bookmark1560" class="s34">infant industry argument; that is, subsidizing or protecting new industries for a time until they become established. (</a><a href="#bookmark1659" class="a">Globalization and Protectionism</a>
<span class="p">explains this concept in more detail.) Countries have
used such policies with some success at certain points in time, but in
the world as a whole, support for key industries is far more often
directed at long-established industries with substantial political power
that are suffering losses and laying off workers, rather than
potentially vibrant new industries that are not yet established. If
government intends to favor certain industries, it needs to do so in a
way that is temporary and that orients them toward a future of market
competition, rather than a future of unending government subsidies and
trade protection.</span></p>
<p>Concerns over International Flows of Capital</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark432" id="bookmark1561" class="s34">Recall from</a>
<a href="#bookmark432" class="a">The Macroeconomic Perspective</a> <span
class="p">that a trade deficit exists when a nation’s imports exceed its
exports. In order for a trade deficit to take place, foreign countries
must provide loans or investments, which they are willing to do because
they expect eventual repayment (that the deficit will become a surplus).
A trade surplus, you may remember, exists when a nation’s exports exceed
its imports. Thus, in order for a trade deficit to switch to a trade
surplus, a nation’s exports must rise and its imports must fall.
Sometimes this happens when the currency decreases in value. For
example, if the U.S. had a trade deficit and the dollar depreciated,
imports would become more expensive. This would, in turn, benefit the
foreign countries that provided the loans or investments.</span><span
id="bookmark1562">‌</span></p>
<p>The expected pattern of trade imbalances in the world economy has been
that high-income economies will run trade surpluses, which means they
will experience a net outflow of capital to foreign destinations or
export more than they import, while low- and middle-income economies
will run trade deficits, which means that they will experience a net
inflow of foreign capital.</p>
<p>This international investing pattern can benefit all sides. Investors in
the high-income countries benefit because they can receive high returns
on their investments, and also because they can diversify their
investments so that they are at less risk of a downturn in their own
domestic economy. The low-income economies that receive an inflow of
capital presumably have potential for rapid catch-up economic growth,
and they can use the international financial capital inflow to help spur
their physical capital investment. In addition, financial capital
inflows often come with management abilities, technological expertise,
and training.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark780" id="bookmark1563" class="s34">However, for the last couple of decades, this cheerful scenario has faced two “dark clouds.” The first cloud is the very large trade or current account deficits in the U.S. economy. (See</a>
<a href="#bookmark780" class="a">The International Trade and Capital</a>
Flows<span class="p">.) Instead of offering net financial investment
abroad, the U.S. economy is soaking up savings from all over the world.
These substantial U.S. trade deficits may not be sustainable according
to Sebastian Edwards writing for the National Bureau of Economic
Research. While trade deficits on their own are not bad, the question is
whether governments will reduce them gradually or hastily. In the
gradual scenario, U.S. exports could grow more rapidly than imports over
a period of years, aided U.S. dollar depreciation. An unintended
consequence of the slow growth since the Great Recession has been a
decline in the U.S. current account deficit’s from 6% pre-recession to
3% most recently.</span></p>
<p>The other option is that the government could reduce the U.S. trade
deficit in a rush. Here is one scenario: if foreign investors became
less willing to hold U.S. dollar assets, the dollar exchange rate could
weaken. As speculators see this process happening, they might rush to
unload their dollar assets, which would drive the dollar down still
further.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1564">A lower U.S. dollar would stimulate aggregate
demand by making exports cheaper and imports more expensive. It would
mean higher prices for imported inputs throughout the economy, shifting
the short-term aggregate supply curve to the left. The result could be a
burst of inflation and, if the Federal Reserve were to run a tight
monetary policy to reduce the inflation, it could also lead to
recession. People sometimes talk as if the U.S. economy, with its great
size, is invulnerable to this sort of pressure from international
markets. While it is difficult to rock, it is not impossible for the $17
trillion U.S. economy to face these international pressures.</span></p>
<p>The second “dark cloud” is how the smaller world economies should deal
with the possibility of sudden foreign financial capital inflows and
outflows. Perhaps the most vivid recent example of the potentially
destructive forces of international capital movements occurred in the
East Asian Tiger economies in 1997–1998. Thanks to their excellent
growth performance over the previous few decades, these economies had
attracted considerable interest from foreign investors. In the
mid-1990s, however, foreign investment into these countries surged even
further. Much of this money funneled through banks that borrowed in U.S.
dollars and loaned in their national currencies. Bank lending surged at
rates of 20% per year or more. This inflow of foreign capital meant that
investment in these economies exceeded the level of domestic savings, so
that current account deficits in these countries jumped into the 5–10%
GDP range.</p>
<p>The surge in bank lending meant that many banks in these East Asian
countries did not do an especially good job of screening out safe and
unsafe borrowers. Many of the loans—as high as 10% to 15% of all loans
in some of these</p>
<p>countries—started to turn bad. Fearing losses, foreign investors started
pulling out their money. As the foreign money left, the exchange rates
of these countries crashed, often falling by 50% or more in a few
months. The banks were stuck with a mismatch: even if the rest of their
domestic loans were repaid, they could never pay back the U.S. dollars
that they owed. The banking sector as a whole went bankrupt. The lack of
credit and lending in the economy collapsed aggregate demand, bringing
on a deep recession.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1565" class="s34">If the flow and ebb of international capital markets can flip even the economies of the East Asian Tigers, with their stellar growth records, into a recession, then it is no wonder that other middle- and low-income countries around the world are concerned. Moreover, similar episodes of an inflow and then an outflow of foreign financial capital have rocked a number of economies around the world: for example, in the last few years, economies like Ireland, Iceland, and Greece have all experienced severe shocks when foreign lenders decided to stop extending funds. Especially in Greece, this caused the government to enact austerity measures which led to protests throughout the country (</a><a href="#bookmark1565" class="a">Figure</a>
19.7<span class="p">).</span></p>

<p><span id="bookmark1565">Figure 19.7 Protests in Greece</span> <span

Great Recession such that the government had to enact austerity
measures, (strict rules) cutting wages and increasing taxes on its
population. Massive protests are but one byproduct. (Credit:

<p>Many nations are taking steps to reduce the risk that their economy will
be injured if foreign financial capital takes flight, including having
their central banks hold large reserves of foreign exchange and stepping
up their regulation of domestic banks to avoid a wave of imprudent
lending. The most controversial steps in this area involve whether
countries should try to take steps to control or reduce the flows of
foreign capital. If a country could discourage some speculative
short-term capital inflow, and instead only encourage investment capital
that it committed for the medium and the long term, then it could be at
least somewhat less susceptible to swings in the sentiments of global
investors.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1566">If economies participate in the global trade of
goods and services, they will also need to participate in international
flows of financial payments and investments. These linkages can offer
great benefits to an economy. However, any nation that is experiencing a
substantial and sustained pattern of trade deficits, along with the
corresponding net inflow of international financial capital, has some
reason for concern. During the Asian Financial Crisis in the late 1990s,
countries that grew dramatically in the years leading up to the crisis
as international capital flowed in, saw their economies collapse when
the capital very quickly flowed out.</span></p>
<p>Market-Oriented Economic Reforms</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1567" class="s34">The standard of living has increased dramatically for billions of people around the world in the last half century. Such increases have occurred not only in the technological leaders like the United States, Canada, the nations of Europe, and Japan, but also in the East Asian Tigers and in many nations of Latin America and Eastern Europe. The challenge for most of these countries is to maintain these growth rates. The economically-challenged regions of the world have stagnated and become stuck in poverty traps. These countries need to focus on the basics: health and education, or human capital development. As</a>
<a href="#bookmark1567" class="a">Figure 19.8</a> <span

education and human capital development in ways that would have not been

<p>Youth Unemployment: Three Cases</p>
<p>Spain and South Africa had the same high youth unemployment in 2011, but
the reasons for this unemployment are different. Spain’s youth
unemployment surged due to the 2008-2009 Great Recession and heavy
indebtedness on the part of its citizens and its government. Spain’s
current account balance is negative, which means it is borrowing
heavily. To cure cyclical unemployment during a recession, the Keynesian
model suggests increases in government spending—fiscal expansion or
monetary expansion. Neither option is open to Spain. It currently can
borrow at only high interest rates, which will be a real problem in
terms of debt service. In addition, the rest of the European Union (EU)
has dragged its feet when it comes to debt forgiveness. Monetary
expansion is not possible because Spain uses the euro and cannot devalue
its currency unless it convinces all of the EU to do so. What can be
done? The <em>Economist</em>, summarizing some ideas of economists and
policymakers, suggests that Spain’s only realistic (although painful)
option is to reduce government-mandated wages, which would allow it to
reduce government spending. As a result, the government would be able to
lower tax rates on the working population. With a lower wage or lower
tax environment, firms will hire more workers. This will lower
unemployment and stimulate the economy. Spain can also encourage greater
foreign investment and try to promote policies that encourage domestic
savings.</p>
<p>South Africa has more of a natural rate of unemployment problem. It is
an interesting case because its youth unemployment is mostly because its
young are not ready to work. Economists commonly refer to this as an
employability problem. According to interviews of South African firms as
reported in the <em>Economist</em>, the young are academically smart but lack
practical skills for the workplace. Despite a big push to increase
investment in human capital, the results have not yet borne fruit.
Recently the government unveiled a plan to pay unemployed youth while
they were “trained-up” or apprenticed in South African firms. The
government</p>
<p>Other than the issue of economic growth, the other three main goals of
macroeconomic policy—that is, low unemployment, low inflation, and a
sustainable balance of trade—all involve situations in which, for some
reason, the economy fails to coordinate the forces of supply and demand.
In the case of cyclical unemployment, for example, the intersection of
aggregate supply and aggregate demand occurs at a level of output below
potential GDP. In the case of the natural rate of unemployment,
government regulations create a situation where otherwise-willing
employers become unwilling to hire otherwise-willing workers. Inflation
is a situation in which aggregate demand outstrips aggregate supply, at
least for a time, so that too much buying power is chasing too few
goods. A trade imbalance is a situation where, because of a net inflow
or outflow of foreign capital, domestic savings are not aligned with
domestic investment. Each of these situations can create a range of
easier or harder policy choices.</p>
<p>has room to increase fiscal expenditure, encourage domestic savings, and
continue to fund investment in education, vocational training, and
apprentice programs. South Africa can also improve the climate for
foreign investment from technology leaders, which would encourage
economic growth.</p>
<p>India has a smaller youth employment problem in terms of percentages.
However, bear in mind that since this is a populous country, it turns
out to be a significant problem in raw numbers. According to Kaushik
Basu, writing for the BBC, “there are 45 national laws governing the
hiring and firing decisions of firms and close to four times that amount
at the state level”. These laws make it difficult for companies to fire
workers. To stay nimble and responsive to markets, Indian companies
respond to these laws by hiring fewer workers. The Indian government can
do much to solve this problem by adjusting its labor laws. Essentially,
the government has to remove itself from firms’ hiring and firing
decisions, so that growing Indian firms can freely employ more workers.
Indian workers, like those in South Africa, do not have workforce
skills. Again, the government can increase its spending on education,
vocational training, and workforce readiness programs.</p>
<p>Finally, India has a significant current account deficit. This deficit
is mainly a result of short- and long-term capital flows. To solve this
deficit, India has experimented by lifting the limitation on domestic
savers from investing abroad. This is a step in the right direction that
may dampen the growth in the current account deficit. A final policy
possibility is to improve domestic capital markets so many self-employed
Indians can obtain access to capital to realize their business ideas. If
more Indians can obtain access to capital to start businesses,
employment might increase.</p>

<p>KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY</p>
<ol>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark1531" class="a">The Diversity of Countries and Economies across the</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark1531">World</a></p>
<p>Macroeconomic policy goals for most countries strive toward low
levels of unemployment and inflation, as well as stable trade
balances. Economists analyze countries based on their GDP per person
and ranked as low-, middle-</p>
<p>, and high-income countries. Low-income are those earning less than
$1,025 (less than 1%) of global income. They currently have 18.5% of
the world population. Middle-income countries are those with per
capital income of</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1,025–\)</span>12,475 (31.1% of global income). They have 69.5% of world
population. High-income countries are those with per capita income
greater than $12,475 (68.3% of global income). They have 12% of the
world’s population. Regional comparisons tend to be inaccurate
because even countries within those regions tend to differ from each
other.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark1540" class="a">Improving Countries’ Standards of</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark1540">Living</a></p>
<p>The fundamentals of growth are the same in every country:
improvements in human capital, physical capital, and technology
interacting in a market-oriented economy. Countries that are
high-income tend to focus on developing and using new technology.
Countries that are middle-income focus on increasing human capital
and becoming more connected to technology and global markets. They
have charted unconventional paths by relying more on state-led
support rather than relying solely on markets. Low-income,
economically-challenged countries have many health and human
development needs, but they are also challenged by the lack of
investment and foreign aid to develop infrastructure like roads.
There are some bright spots when it comes to financial development
and mobile communications, which suggest that low-income countries
can become technology leaders in their own right, but it is too
early to claim victory. These countries must do more to connect to
the rest of the global economy and find the technologies that work
best for them.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark1548" class="a">Causes of Unemployment around the</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark1548">World</a></p>
<p>We can address cyclical unemployment by expansionary fiscal and
monetary policy. The natural rate of unemployment can be harder to
solve, because it involves thinking carefully about the tradeoffs
involved in laws that affect employment and hiring. Unemployment is
understood differently in high-income countries compared to low- and
middle-income countries. People in these countries are not
“unemployed” in the sense that we use the term in the United States
and Europe, but neither are they employed in a regular wage-paying
job. While some may have regular wage-paying jobs, others are part
of a barter economy.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark1555" class="a">Causes of Inflation in Various Countries and</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark1555">Regions</a></p>
<p>Most high-income economies have learned that their central banks can
control inflation in the medium and the long</p>
<p>term. In addition, they have learned that inflation has no long-term
benefits but potentially substantial long-term costs if it distracts
businesses from focusing on real productivity gains. However,
smaller economies around the world may face more volatile inflation
because their smaller economies can be unsettled by international
movements of capital and goods.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark1558" class="a">Balance of Trade</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark1558">Concerns</a></p></li>
</ol>
<p>There are many legitimate concerns over possible negative consequences
of free trade. Perhaps the single strongest response to these concerns
is that there are good ways to address them without restricting trade
and thus losing its benefits. There are two major issues involving trade
imbalances. One is what will happen with the large U.S. trade deficits,
and whether they will come down gradually or with a rush. The other is
whether smaller countries around the world should take some steps to
limit flows of international capital, in the hope that they will not be
quite so susceptible to economic whiplash from international financial
capital flowing in and out of their economies.</p>

<p>Just Whose iPhone Is It?</p>
<p>The iPhone is a global product. Apple does not manufacture the iPhone
components, nor does it assemble them. The assembly is done by Foxconn
Corporation, a Taiwanese company, at its factory in Sengzhen, China.
But, Samsung, the electronics firm and competitor to Apple, actually
supplies many of the parts that make up an iPhone—representing about 26%
of the costs of production. That means, that Samsung is both the biggest
supplier and biggest competitor for Apple. Why do these two firms work
together to produce the iPhone? To understand the economic logic behind
international trade, you have to accept, as these firms do, that trade
is about mutually beneficial exchange. Samsung is one of the world’s
largest electronics parts suppliers. Apple lets Samsung focus on making
the best parts, which allows Apple to concentrate on its
strength—designing elegant products that are easy to use. If each
company (and by extension each country) focuses on what it does best,
there will be gains for all through trade.</p>

The clothes you wear might be designed in Italy and manufactured in
China. The toys you give to a child might have come from India. The car
you drive might come from Japan, Germany, or Korea. The gasoline in the
tank might be refined from crude oil from Saudi Arabia, Mexico, or
Nigeria. As a worker, if your job is involved with farming, machinery,
airplanes, cars, scientific instruments, or many other
technology-related industries, the odds are good that a hearty
proportion of the sales of your employer—and hence the money that pays
your salary—comes from export sales. We are all linked by international
trade, and the volume of that trade has grown dramatically in the last
few decades.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1594">The first wave of globalization started in the
nineteenth century and lasted up to the beginning of World War I. Over
that time, global exports as a share of global GDP rose from less than
1% of GDP in 1820 to 9% of GDP in 1913. As the Nobel Prize-winning
economist Paul Krugman of Princeton University wrote in 1995:</span></p>
<p>It is a late-twentieth-century conceit that we invented the global
economy just yesterday. In fact, world markets achieved an impressive
degree of integration during the second half of the nineteenth century.
Indeed, if one wants a specific date for the beginning of a truly global
economy, one might well choose 1869, the year in which both the Suez
Canal and the Union Pacific railroad were completed. By the eve of the
First World War steamships and railroads had created markets for
standardized commodities, like wheat and wool, that were fully global in
their reach. Even the global flow of information was better than modern
observers, focused on electronic technology, tend to realize: the first
submarine telegraph cable was laid under the Atlantic in 1858, and by
1900 all of the world’s major economic regions could effectively
communicate instantaneously.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1595">This first wave of globalization crashed to a
halt early in the twentieth century. World War I severed many economic
connections. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, many nations
misguidedly tried to fix their own economies by reducing foreign trade
with others. World War II further hindered international trade. Global
flows of goods and financial capital were rebuilt only slowly after
World War II. It was not until the early 1980s that global economic
forces again became as important, relative to the size of the world
economy, as they were before World War I.</span></p>

style=" color: #3767B1;">Absolute and Comparative
Advantage</span><span id="bookmark1596">‌</span></p>
<p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Define absolute advantage, comparative advantage, and
opportunity costs</p></li>
<li><p>Explain the gains of trade created when a country specializes</p>
<p>The American statesman Benjamin Franklin (1706–1790) once wrote:
“No nation was ever ruined by trade.” Many economists would
express their attitudes toward international trade in an even
more positive manner. The evidence that international trade
confers overall benefits on economies is pretty strong. Trade
has accompanied economic growth in the United States and around
the world. Many of the national economies that have shown the
most rapid growth in the last several decades—for example,
Japan, South Korea, China, and India—have done so by
dramatically orienting their economies toward international
trade. There is no modern example of a country that has shut
itself off from world trade and yet prospered. To understand the
benefits of trade, or why we trade in the first place, we need
to understand the concepts of comparative and absolute
advantage.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1597">In 1817, David Ricardo, a businessman,
economist, and member of the British Parliament, wrote a
treatise called</span> <em>On the Principles of Political Economy
and Taxation</em>. In this treatise, Ricardo argued that
specialization and free trade benefit all trading partners, even
those that may be relatively inefficient. To see what he meant,
we must be able to distinguish between absolute and comparative
advantage.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1598">A country has an</span> <strong>absolute
advantage</strong> over another country in producing a good if it uses
fewer resources to produce that good. Absolute advantage can be
the result of a country’s natural endowment. For example,
extracting oil in</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia is pretty much just a matter of “drilling a hole.”
Producing oil in other countries can require considerable
exploration and costly technologies for drilling and
extraction—if they have any oil at all. The United States has
some of the richest farmland in the world, making it easier to
grow corn and wheat than in many other countries. Guatemala and
Colombia have climates especially suited for growing coffee.
Chile and Zambia have some of the world’s richest copper mines.
As some have argued, “geography is destiny.” Chile will provide
copper and Guatemala will produce coffee, and they will trade.
When each country has a product others need and it can produce
it with fewer resources in one country than in another, then it
is easy to imagine all parties benefitting from trade. However,
thinking about trade just in terms of geography and absolute
advantage is incomplete. Trade really occurs because of
comparative advantage.</p>

<p><a href="#bookmark96" id="bookmark1599" class="s34">Recall from the chapter</a>
<a href="#bookmark96" class="a">Choice in a World of Scarcity</a>
<a href="#bookmark96" class="s34">that a country has a comparative advantage when it can produce a good at a lower cost in terms of other goods. The question each country or company should be asking when it trades is this: “What do we give up to produce this good?” It should be no surprise that the concept of comparative advantage is based on this idea of opportunity cost from</a>
<a href="#bookmark96" class="a">Choice in a World of</a>
Scarcity<span class="p">. For example, if Zambia focuses its
resources on producing copper, it cannot use its labor, land and
financial resources to produce other goods such as corn. As a
result, Zambia gives up the opportunity to produce corn. How do
we quantify the cost in terms of other goods? Simplify the
problem and assume that Zambia just needs labor to produce
copper and corn. The companies that produce either copper or
corn tell you that it takes two hours to mine a ton of copper
and one hour to harvest a bushel of corn. This means the
opportunity cost of producing a ton of copper is two bushels of
corn. The next section develops absolute and comparative
advantage in greater detail and relates them to
trade.</span><span id="bookmark1600">‌</span></p>
<p>A Numerical Example of Absolute and Comparative Advantage</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1601" class="s34">Consider a hypothetical world with two countries, Saudi Arabia and the United States, and two products, oil and corn. Further assume that consumers in both countries desire both these goods. These goods are homogeneous, meaning that consumers/producers cannot differentiate between corn or oil from either country. There is only one resource available in both countries, labor hours. Saudi Arabia can produce oil with fewer resources, while the United States can produce corn with fewer resources.</a>

<a href="#bookmark1601" class="s84">(a) Saudi Arabia can produce 100 barrels of oil at maximum and zero corn (point A), or 25 bushels of corn and zero oil (point B). It can also produce other combinations of oil and corn if it wants to consume both goods, such as at point C.

<p>Table 20.3 Production before Trade</p>
<p>The slope of the production possibility frontier illustrates the
opportunity cost of producing oil in terms of corn. Using all its
resources, the United States can produce 50 barrels of oil <em>or</em> 100
bushels of corn; therefore, the opportunity cost of one barrel of oil is
two bushels of corn—or the slope is 1/2. Thus, in the U.S. production
possibility frontier graph, every increase in oil production of one
barrel implies a decrease of two bushels of corn. Saudi Arabia can
produce 100 barrels of oil <em>or</em>
<a href="#bookmark1606" class="s34">25 bushels of corn. The opportunity cost of producing one barrel of oil is the loss of 1/4 of a bushel of corn that Saudi workers could otherwise have produced. In terms of corn, notice that Saudi Arabia gives up the least to produce a barrel of oil.</a>

<p>Can a production possibility frontier be straight?</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark96" class="s84">When you first met the production possibility frontier (PPF) in the chapter on</a>
Choice in a World of Scarcity <span class="s37">we drew it with an
outward-bending shape. This shape illustrated that as we transferred
inputs from producing one good to another—like from education to health
services—there were increasing opportunity costs. In the examples in
this chapter, we draw the PPFs as straight lines, which means that
opportunity costs are constant. When we transfer a marginal unit of
labor away from growing corn and toward producing oil, the decline in
the quantity of corn and the increase in the quantity of oil is always
the same. In reality this is possible only if the contribution of
additional workers to output did not change as the scale of production
changed. The linear production possibilities frontier is a less
realistic model, but a straight line simplifies calculations. It also
illustrates economic themes like absolute and comparative advantage just
as clearly.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1601" class="s34">In this example, there is symmetry between absolute and comparative advantage. Saudi Arabia needs fewer worker hours to produce oil (absolute advantage, see</a>
<a href="#bookmark1601" class="a">Table</a>
20.1<a href="#bookmark1606" class="s34">), and also gives up the least in terms of other goods to produce oil (comparative advantage, see</a>
<a href="#bookmark1606" class="a">Table</a> 20.4<span class="p">). Such
symmetry is not always the case, as we will show after we have discussed
gains from trade fully, but first, read the following Clear It Up
feature to make sure you understand why the PPF line in the graphs is
straight.</span></p>
<p>Gains from Trade</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1607"><span class="p">Consider the trading positions
of the United States and Saudi Arabia after they have specialized and
traded. Before trade, Saudi Arabia produces/consumes 60 barrels of oil
and 10 bushels of corn. The United States produces/ consumes 20 barrels
of oil and 60 bushels of corn. Given their current production levels, if
the United States can trade an amount of corn fewer than 60 bushels and
receives in exchange an amount of oil greater than 20 barrels, it will
</span></span><span class="s31">gain from
trade</span><a href="#bookmark14" class="s34">. With trade, the United States can consume more of both goods than it did without specialization and trade. (Recall that the chapter</a>
<a href="#bookmark14" class="a">Welcome to</a> Economics!
<a href="#bookmark1608" class="s34">defined specialization as it applies to workers and firms. Economists also use specialization to describe the occurrence when a country shifts resources to focus on producing a good that offers comparative advantage.)

<p>Table 20.5 The Range of Trades That Benefit Both the United States and
Saudi Arabia</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_411.png" width="624" height="51" alt="image" />
<p>What are the opportunity costs and gains from trade?</p>
<p>The range of trades that will benefit each country is based on the
country’s opportunity cost of producing each good. The United States can
produce 100 bushels of corn or 50 barrels of oil. For the United States,
the opportunity cost of producing one barrel of oil is two bushels of
corn. If we divide the numbers above by 50, we get the same ratio: one
barrel of oil is equivalent to two bushels of corn, or (100/50 = 2 and
50/50 = 1). In a trade with Saudi Arabia, if the United States is going
to give up 100 bushels of corn in exports, it must import at least 50
barrels of oil to be just as well off. Clearly, to gain from trade it
needs to be able to gain more than a half barrel of oil for its bushel
of corn—or why trade at all?</p>
<p>The underlying reason why trade benefits both sides is rooted in the
concept of opportunity cost, as the following Clear It Up feature
explains. If Saudi Arabia wishes to expand domestic production of corn
in a world without international trade, then based on its opportunity
costs it must give up four barrels of oil for every one additional
bushel of corn. If Saudi Arabia could find a way to give up less than
four barrels of oil for an additional bushel of corn (or equivalently,
to receive more than one bushel of corn for four barrels of oil), it
would be better off.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1609" class="s34">Recall that David Ricardo argued that if each country specializes in its comparative advantage, it will benefit from trade, and total global output will increase. How can we show gains from trade as a result of comparative advantage and specialization?</a>
<a href="#bookmark1609" class="a">Table 20.6</a>

<p><a href="#bookmark1610" class="s34">Starting at point C, which shows Saudi oil production of 60, reduce Saudi oil domestic oil consumption by 20, since 20 is exported to the United States and exchanged for 20 units of corn.

<a href="#bookmark1610" class="a">Figure</a> 20.3<span class="p">).
Notice that even without 100% specialization, if the “trading price,” in
this case 20 barrels of oil for 20 bushels of corn, is greater than the
country’s opportunity cost, the Saudis will gain from trade. Since the
post-trade consumption point D is beyond its production possibility

<ul>
<li><p>Show the relationship between production costs and comparative
advantage</p></li>
<li><p>Identify situations of mutually beneficial trade</p></li>
<li><p>Identify trade benefits by considering opportunity costs</p>
<p>What happens to the possibilities for trade if one country has
an absolute advantage in everything? This is typical for
high-income countries that often have well-educated workers,
technologically advanced equipment, and the most up-to-date
production processes. These high-income countries can produce
all products with fewer resources than a low-income country. If
the high-income country is more productive across the board,
will there still be gains from trade? Good students of Ricardo
understand that trade is about mutually beneficial exchange.
Even when one country has an absolute advantage in all products,
trade can still benefit both sides. This is because gains from
trade come from specializing in one’s comparative advantage.</p>
<p>Production Possibilities and Comparative Advantage</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1612" class="s34">Consider the example of trade between the United States and Mexico described in</a>

produce 1,000 pairs of shoes, but it takes five Mexican workers
to do so. It takes one U.S. worker to produce 1,000
refrigerators, but it takes four Mexican workers to do so. The
United States has an absolute advantage in productivity with
regard to both shoes and refrigerators; that is, it takes fewer
workers in the United States than in Mexico to produce both a
given number of shoes and a given number of
refrigerators.</span></p>

<p>Table 20.7 Resources Needed to Produce Shoes and Refrigerators</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1613">Absolute advantage simply compares the
productivity of a worker between countries. It answers the
question, “How many inputs do I need to produce shoes in
Mexico?” Comparative advantage asks this same question slightly
differently. Instead of comparing how many workers it takes to
produce a good, it asks, “How much am I giving up to produce
this good in this country?” Another way of looking at this is
that comparative advantage identifies the good for which the
producer’s absolute advantage is relatively larger, or where the
producer’s absolute productivity disadvantage is relatively
smaller. The United States can produce 1,000 shoes with
four-fifths as many workers as Mexico (four versus five), but it
can produce 1,000 refrigerators with only one-quarter as many
workers (one versus four). So, the comparative advantage of the
United States, where its absolute productivity advantage is
relatively</span></p>
<p>greatest, lies with refrigerators, and Mexico’s comparative
advantage, where its absolute productivity disadvantage is
least, is in the production of shoes.</p>
<p>Mutually Beneficial Trade with Comparative Advantage</p>
<p>When nations increase production in their area of comparative
advantage and trade with each other, both countries can benefit.
Again, the production possibility frontier is a useful tool to
visualize this benefit.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1614" class="s34">Consider a situation where the United States and Mexico each have 40 workers. For example, as</a>
<a href="#bookmark1614" class="a">Table 20.8</a> <span
class="p">shows, if the United States divides its labor so that
40 workers are making shoes, then, since it takes four workers
in the United States to make 1,000 shoes, a total of 10,000
shoes will be produced. (If four workers can make 1,000 shoes,
then 40 workers will make 10,000 shoes). If the 40 workers in
the United States are making refrigerators, and each worker can
produce 1,000 refrigerators, then a total of 40,000
refrigerators will be produced.</span></p>

<p><a href="#bookmark1617" class="s34">Continuing with this scenario, suppose that each country transfers some amount of labor toward its area of comparative advantage. For example, the United States transfers six workers away from shoes and toward producing refrigerators. As a result, U.S. production of shoes decreases by 1,500 units (6/4 × 1,000), while its production of refrigerators increases by 6,000 (that is, 6/1 × 1,000). Mexico also moves production toward its area of comparative advantage, transferring 10 workers away from refrigerators and toward production of shoes. As a result, production of refrigerators in Mexico falls by 2,500 (10/4 × 1,000), but production of shoes increases by 2,000 pairs (10/5 × 1,000).

<p>Table 20.10 Shifting Production Toward Comparative Advantage
Raises Total Output</p>
<p>This numerical example illustrates the remarkable insight of
comparative advantage: even when one country has an absolute
advantage in all goods and another country has an absolute
disadvantage in all goods, both countries can still benefit from
trade. Even though the United States has an absolute advantage
in producing both refrigerators and shoes, it makes economic
sense for it to specialize in the good for which it has a
comparative advantage. The United States will export
refrigerators and in return import shoes.</p>
<p>How Opportunity Cost Sets the Boundaries of Trade</p>
<p>This example shows that both parties can benefit from
specializing in their comparative advantages and trading. By
using the opportunity costs in this example, it is possible to
identify the range of possible trades that would benefit each
country.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1615" id="bookmark1618" class="s34">Mexico started out, before specialization and trade, producing 4,000 pairs of shoes and 5,000 refrigerators (see</a>
<a href="#bookmark1615" class="a">Figure</a> 20.4
<a href="#bookmark1616" class="s34">and</a>
<a href="#bookmark1616" class="a">Table</a> 20.9<span
class="p">). Then, in the numerical example given, Mexico
shifted production toward its comparative advantage and produced
6,000 pairs of shoes but only 2,500 refrigerators. Thus, if
Mexico can export no more than 2,000 pairs of shoes (giving up
2,000 pairs of shoes) in exchange for imports of at least 2,500
refrigerators (a gain of 2,500 refrigerators), it will be able
to consume more of both goods than before trade. Mexico will be
unambiguously better off. Conversely, the United States started
off, before specialization and trade, producing 5,000 pairs of
shoes and 20,000 refrigerators. In the example, it then shifted
production toward its comparative advantage, producing only
3,500 shoes but 26,000 refrigerators. If the United States can
export no more than 6,000 refrigerators in exchange for imports
of at least 1,500 pairs of shoes, it will be able to consume
more of both goods and will be unambiguously better
off.</span><span id="bookmark1619">‌</span></p>

<p><span id="bookmark1621">Trade allows each country to take
advantage of lower opportunity costs in the other country. If
Mexico wants to produce more refrigerators without trade, it
must face its domestic opportunity costs and reduce shoe
production. If Mexico, instead, produces more shoes and then
trades for refrigerators made in the United States, where the
opportunity cost of producing refrigerators is lower, Mexico can
in effect take advantage of the lower opportunity cost of
refrigerators in the United States. Conversely, when the United
States specializes in its comparative advantage of refrigerator
production and trades for shoes produced in Mexico,
international trade allows the United States to take advantage

<li><p>In this example, is absolute advantage the same as

<li><p><a href="#bookmark1622" class="s84">In what product should Canada specialize? In what product should Venezuela specialize? Step 1. Make a table like</a>
<a href="#bookmark1622" class="s43">Table</a> 20.12<span
class="s37">.</span></p></li>
</ol>
<p>Step 2. To calculate absolute advantage, look at the larger of
the numbers for each product. One worker in Canada can produce
more lumber (40 tons versus 30 tons), so Canada has the absolute
advantage in lumber. One worker in Venezuela can produce 60
barrels of oil compared to a worker in Canada who can produce
only 20.</p>
<p>Step 3. To calculate comparative advantage, find the opportunity
cost of producing one barrel of oil in both countries. The
country with the lowest opportunity cost has the comparative
advantage. With the same labor</p>
<p>time, Canada can produce either 20 barrels of oil or 40 tons of
lumber. So in effect, 20 barrels of oil is equivalent to 40 tons
of lumber: 20 oil = 40 lumber. Divide both sides of the equation
by 20 to calculate the opportunity cost of one barrel of oil in
Canada. 20/20 oil = 40/20 lumber. 1 oil = 2 lumber. To produce
one additional barrel of oil in Canada has an opportunity cost
of 2 lumber. Calculate the same way for Venezuela: 60 oil = 30
lumber. Divide both sides of the equation by 60. One oil in
Venezuela has an opportunity cost of 1/ 2 lumber. Because 1/2
lumber &lt; 2 lumber, Venezuela has the comparative advantage in
producing oil.</p>
<p>Step 4. Calculate the opportunity cost of one lumber by
reversing the numbers, with lumber on the left side of the
equation. In Canada, 40 lumber is equivalent in labor time to 20
barrels of oil: 40 lumber = 20 oil. Divide each side of the
equation by 40. The opportunity cost of one lumber is 1/2 oil.
In Venezuela, the equivalent labor time will produce 30 lumber
or 60 oil: 30 lumber = 60 oil. Divide each side by 30. One
lumber has an opportunity cost of two oil. Canada has the lower
opportunity cost in producing lumber.</p>
<p>Step 5. In this example, absolute advantage is the same as
comparative advantage. Canada has the absolute and comparative
advantage in lumber; Venezuela has the absolute and comparative
advantage in oil.</p>
<p>Step 6. Canada should specialize in the commodity for which it
has a relative lower opportunity cost, which is lumber, and
Venezuela should specialize in oil. Canada will be exporting
lumber and importing oil, and Venezuela will be exporting oil
and importing lumber.</p>
<p>Comparative Advantage Goes Camping</p>
<p>To build an intuitive understanding of how comparative advantage
can benefit all parties, set aside examples that involve
national economies for a moment and consider the situation of a
group of friends who decide to go camping together. The six
friends have a wide range of skills and experiences, but one
person in particular, Jethro, has done lots of camping before
and is also a great athlete. Jethro has an absolute advantage in
all aspects of camping: he is faster at carrying a backpack,
gathering firewood, paddling a canoe, setting up tents, making a
meal, and washing up. So here is the question: Because Jethro
has an absolute productivity advantage in everything, should he
do all the work?</p>
<p>Of course not! Even if Jethro is willing to work like a mule
while everyone else sits around, he, like all mortals, only has
24 hours in a day. If everyone sits around and waits for Jethro
to do everything, not only will Jethro be an unhappy camper, but
there will not be much output for his group of six friends to
consume. The theory of comparative advantage suggests that
everyone will benefit if they figure out their areas of
comparative advantage—that is, the area of camping where their
productivity disadvantage is least, compared to Jethro. For
example, it may be that Jethro is 80% faster at building fires
and cooking meals than anyone else, but only 20% faster at
gathering firewood and 10% faster at setting up tents. In that
case, Jethro should focus on building fires and making meals,
and others should attend to the other tasks, each according to
where their productivity disadvantage is smallest. If the
campers coordinate their efforts according to comparative
advantage, they can all gain.</p>

Economies</span><span id="bookmark1623">‌</span></p>
<p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Identify at least two advantages of intra-industry trading</p></li>
<li><p>Explain the relationship between economies of scale and
intra-industry trade</p>
<p>Absolute and comparative advantages explain a great deal about
global trading patterns. For example, they help to explain the
patterns that we noted at the start of this chapter, like why
you may be eating fresh fruit from Chile or Mexico, or why lower
productivity regions like Africa and Latin America are able to
sell a substantial proportion of their exports to higher
productivity regions like the European Union and North America.
Comparative advantage, however, at least at first glance, does
not seem especially well-suited to explain other common patterns
of international trade.</p>
<p>The Prevalence of Intra-industry Trade between Similar Economies</p>
<p>The theory of comparative advantage suggests that trade should
happen between economies with large differences in opportunity
costs of production. Roughly half of all world trade involves
shipping goods between the fairly similar</p>

<p>Table 20.14 Some Intra-Industry U.S. Exports and Imports in 2014
<a href="http://www.bea.gov/" class="s48">(Source:</a> <span
class="s47"><a class="reference external" href="http://www.bea.gov/">http://www.bea.gov/</a>
newsreleases/international/trade/tradnewsrelease.htm)</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark1627">Why do similar high-income economies
engage in intra-industry trade? What can be the economic benefit
of having workers of fairly similar skills making cars,
computers, machinery and other products which are then shipped
across the oceans to and from the United States, the European
Union, and Japan? There are two reasons: (1) The division of
labor leads to learning, innovation, and unique skills; and (2)
economies of scale.</span></p>
<p>Gains from Specialization and Learning</p>
<p>Consider the category of machinery, where the U.S. economy has
considerable intra-industry trade. Machinery comes in many
varieties, so the United States may be exporting machinery for
manufacturing with wood, but importing machinery for
photographic processing. The underlying reason why a country
like the United States, Japan, or Germany produces one kind of
machinery rather than another is usually not related to U.S.,
German, or Japanese firms and workers having generally higher or
lower skills. It is just that, in working on very specific and
particular products, firms in certain countries develop unique
and different skills.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1628">Specialization in the world economy can
be very finely split. In fact, recent years have seen a trend in
international trade, which economists call</span> <strong>splitting up
the value chain</strong>. The <strong>value chain</strong> describes how a good is
produced in stages. As indicated in the beginning of the
chapter, producing the iPhone involves designing and engineering
the phone in the United States, supplying parts from Korea,
assembling the parts in China, and advertising and marketing in
the United States. Thanks in large part to improvements in
communication technology, sharing information, and
transportation, it has become easier to split up the value
chain. Instead of production in a single large factory,
different firms operating in various places and even different
countries can divide the value chain. Because firms split up the
value chain, international trade often does not involve nations
trading whole finished products like automobiles or
refrigerators. Instead, it involves shipping more specialized
goods like, say, automobile dashboards or the shelving that fits
inside refrigerators. Intra-industry trade between similar
countries produces economic gains because it allows workers and
firms to learn and innovate on particular products—and often to
focus on very particular parts of the value chain.</p>

style=" color: #000;">for some interesting information about the
assembly of the iPhone.</span></p>
<p>Economies of Scale, Competition, Variety</p>
<p><a href="http://cnx.org/content/m63680/latest/" id="bookmark1629" class="s34">A second broad reason that intra-industry trade between similar nations produces economic gains involves economies of scale. The concept of economies of scale, as we introduced in</a>
<a href="http://cnx.org/content/m63680/latest/" class="a">Production, Costs and Industry Structure (http://cnx.org/content/m63680/latest/)</a>
<a href="#bookmark1630" class="s34">, means that as the scale of output goes up, average costs of production decline—at least up to a point.</a>
<a href="#bookmark1630" class="a">Figure 20.5</a> <span
class="p">illustrates economies of scale for a plant producing
toaster ovens. The horizontal axis of the figure shows the
quantity of production by a certain firm or at a certain
manufacturing plant. The vertical axis measures the average cost
of production. Production plant S produces a small level of
output at 30 units and has an average cost of production of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(30
per toaster oven. Plant M produces at a medium level of output
at 50 units, and has an average cost of production of \)</span>20 per
toaster oven. Plant L produces 150 units of output with an
average cost of production of only $10 per toaster oven.
Although plant V can produce 200 units of output, it still has
the same unit cost as Plant L.</span></p>
<p>In this example, a small or medium plant, like S or M, will not
be able to compete in the market with a large or a very large
plant like L or V, because the firm that operates L or V will be
able to produce and sell its output at a lower price. In this
example, economies of scale operate up to point L, but beyond
point L to V, the additional scale of production does not
continue to reduce average costs of production.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_418.jpg" width="301" height="205" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark1630">Figure 20.5 Economies of Scale</span>
<span class="s37">Production Plant S, has an average cost of
production of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(30 per toaster oven. Production plant M has an
average cost of production of \)</span>20 per toaster oven. Production
plant L has an average cost of production of only <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10 per
toaster oven. Production plant V still has an average cost of
production of \)</span>10 per toaster oven. Thus, production plant M can
produce toaster ovens more cheaply than plant S because of
economies of scale, and plants L or V can produce more cheaply
than S or M because of economies of scale. However, the
economies of scale end at an output level of 150. Plant V,
despite being larger, cannot produce more cheaply on average
than plant L.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark1631">The concept of economies of scale
becomes especially relevant to international trade when it
enables one or two large producers to supply the entire country.
For example, a single large automobile factory could probably
supply all the cars consumers purchase in a smaller economy like
the United Kingdom or Belgium in a given year. However, if a
country has only one or two large factories producing cars, and
no international trade, then consumers in that country would
have relatively little choice between kinds of cars (other than
the color of the paint and other nonessential options). Little
or no competition will exist between different car
manufacturers.</span></p>
<p>International trade provides a way to combine the lower average
production costs that come from economies of scale and still
have competition and variety for consumers. Large automobile
factories in different countries can make and sell their
products around the world. If General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler
were the only players in the</p>
<p>U.S. automobile market, the level of competition and consumer
choice would be considerably lower than when U.S. carmakers must
face competition from Toyota, Honda, Suzuki, Fiat, Mitsubishi,
Nissan, Volkswagen, Kia, Hyundai, BMW, Subaru, and others.
Greater competition brings with it innovation and responsiveness
to what consumers want. America’s car producers make far better
cars now than they did several decades ago, and much of the
reason is competitive pressure, especially from East Asian and
European carmakers.</p>
<p>Dynamic Comparative Advantage</p>
<p>The sources of gains from intra-industry trade between similar
economies—namely, the learning that comes from a high degree of
specialization and splitting up the value chain and from
economies of scale—do not contradict the earlier theory of
comparative advantage. Instead, they help to broaden the
concept.</p>
<p>In intra-industry trade, climate or geography do not determine
the level of worker productivity. Even the general level of
education or skill does not determine it. Instead, how firms
engage in specific learning about specialized products,
including taking advantage of economies of scale determine the
level of worker productivity. In this vision, comparative
advantage can be dynamic—that is, it can evolve and change over
time as one develops new skills and as manufacturers split the
value chain in new ways. This line of thinking also suggests
that countries are not destined to have the same comparative
advantage forever, but must instead be flexible in response to
ongoing changes in comparative advantage.</p>

Benefits of Reducing Barriers to International Trade</span><span
id="bookmark1632">‌</span></p>
<p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Explain tarrifs as barriers to trade</p></li>
<li><p>Identify at least two benefits of reducing barriers to
international trade</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1633">Tariffs</span> <span class="p">are taxes
that governments place on imported goods for a variety of
reasons. Some of these reasons include protecting sensitive
industries, for humanitarian reasons, and protecting against
dumping. Traditionally, tariffs were used simply as a political
tool to protect certain vested economic, social, and cultural
interests. The World Trade Organization (WTO) is committed to
lowering barriers to trade. The world’s nations meet through the
WTO to negotiate how they can reduce barriers to trade, such as
tariffs. WTO negotiations happen in “rounds,” where all
countries negotiate one agreement to encourage trade, take a
year or two off, and then start negotiating a new agreement. The
current round of negotiations is called the Doha Round because
it was officially launched in Doha, the capital city of Qatar,
in November 2001. In 2009, economists from the World Bank
summarized recent research and found that the Doha round of
negotiations would increase the size of the world economy by
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(160 billion to \)</span>385 billion per year, depending on the precise
deal that ended up being negotiated.</span><span
id="bookmark1634">‌</span><span id="bookmark1635">‌</span></p>
<p>In the context of a global economy that currently produces more
than $30 trillion of goods and services each year, this amount
is not huge: it is an increase of 1% or less. But before
dismissing the gains from trade too quickly, it is worth
remembering two points.</p>
</li>
<li><p>First, a gain of a few hundred billion dollars is enough money
to deserve attention! Moreover, remember that this increase is
not a one-time event; it would persist each year into the
future.</p></li>
<li><p>Second, the estimate of gains may be on the low side because
some of the gains from trade are not measured especially well in
economic statistics. For example, it is difficult to measure the
potential advantages to consumers of having a variety of
products available and a greater degree of competition among
producers. Perhaps the most important unmeasured factor is that
trade between countries, especially when firms are splitting up
the value chain of production, often involves a transfer of
knowledge that can involve skills in production, technology,
management, finance, and law.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Low-income countries benefit more from trade than high-income countries
do. In some ways, the giant U.S. economy has less need for international
trade, because it can already take advantage of internal trade within
its economy. However, many smaller national economies around the world,
in regions like Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia, have
much more limited possibilities for trade inside their countries or
their immediate regions. Without international trade, they may have
little ability to benefit from comparative advantage, slicing up the
value chain, or economies of scale. Moreover, smaller economies often
have fewer competitive firms making goods within their economy, and thus
firms have less pressure from other firms to provide the goods and
prices that consumers want.</p>

<span style=" color: #000;">for a list of some benefits of trade.</span></p>
<p>The economic gains from expanding international trade are measured in
hundreds of billions of dollars, and the gains from international trade
as a whole probably reach well into the trillions of dollars. The
potential for gains from trade may be especially high among the smaller
and lower-income countries of the world.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_420.png" width="624" height="160" alt="image" />
<p>From Interpersonal to International Trade</p>
<p>Most people find it easy to believe that they, personally, would not be
better off if they tried to grow and process all of their own food, to
make all of their own clothes, to build their own cars and houses from
scratch, and so on. Instead, we all benefit from living in economies
where people and firms can specialize and trade with each other.</p>
<p>The benefits of trade do not stop at national boundaries, either.
Earlier we explained that the division of labor could increase output
for three reasons: (1) workers with different characteristics can
specialize in the types of production where they have a comparative
advantage; (2) firms and workers who specialize in a certain product
become more productive with learning and practice; and (3) economies of
scale. These three reasons apply from the individual and community level
right up to the international level. If it makes sense to you that
interpersonal, intercommunity, and interstate trade offer economic
gains, it should make sense that international trade offers gains, too.</p>

<p>It’s Apple’s (Global) iPhone</p>
<p>Apple Corporation uses a global platform to produce the iPhone. Now that
you understand the concept of comparative advantage, you can see why the
engineering and design of the iPhone is done in the United States. The
United States has built up a comparative advantage over the years in
designing and marketing products, and sacrifices fewer resources to
design high-tech devices relative to other countries. China has a
comparative advantage in assembling the phone due to its large skilled
labor force. Korea has a comparative advantage in producing components.
Korea focuses its production by increasing its scale, learning better
ways to produce screens and computer chips, and uses innovation to lower
average costs of production. Apple, in turn, benefits because it can
purchase these quality products at lower prices. Put the global assembly
line together and you have the device with which we are all so familiar.</p>
<p>International trade currently involves about $20 trillion worth of goods
and services moving around the globe. Any economic force of that size,
even if it confers overall benefits, is certain to cause disruption and
controversy. This chapter has only made the case that trade brings
economic benefits. Other chapters discuss, in detail, the public policy
arguments over whether to restrict international trade.</p>

<p>KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY</p>
<ol>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark1596" class="a">Absolute and Comparative</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark1596">Advantage</a></p>
<p>A country has an absolute advantage in those products in which it
has a productivity edge over other countries; it takes fewer
resources to produce a product. A country has a comparative
advantage when it can produce a good at a lower cost in terms of
other goods. Countries that specialize based on comparative
advantage gain from trade.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark1611" class="a">What Happens When a Country Has an Absolute Advantage in All</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark1611">Goods</a></p>
<p>Even when a country has high levels of productivity in all goods, it
can still benefit from trade. Gains from trade come about as a
result of comparative advantage. By specializing in a good that it
gives up the least to produce, a country can produce more and offer
that additional output for sale. If other countries specialize in
the area of their comparative advantage as well and trade, the
highly productive country is able to benefit from a lower
opportunity cost of production in other countries.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark1623" class="a">Intra-industry Trade between Similar</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark1623">Economies</a></p>
<p>A large share of global trade happens between high-income economies
that are quite similar in having well-educated workers and advanced
technology. These countries practice intra-industry trade, in which
they import and export the same products at the same time, like
cars, machinery, and computers. In the case of intra-industry trade
between economies with similar income levels, the gains from trade
come from specialized learning in very particular tasks and from
economies of scale. Splitting up the value chain means that several
stages of producing a good take place in different countries around
the world.</p>

<li><p><a href="#bookmark1632" class="a">The Benefits of Reducing Barriers to International</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark1632">Trade</a></p></li>
</ol>
<p>Tariffs are placed on imported goods as a way of protecting sensitive
industries, for humanitarian reasons, and for protection against
dumping. Traditionally, tariffs were used as a political tool to protect
certain vested economic, social, and cultural interests. The WTO has
been, and continues to be, a way for nations to meet and negotiate in
order to reduce barriers to trade. The gains of international trade are
very large, especially for smaller countries, but are beneficial to all.</p>

<p>What’s the Downside of Protection?</p>
<p>Governments are motivated to limit and alter market outcomes for
political or social ends. While governments can limit the rise in prices
of some products, they cannot control how much people want to buy or how
much firms are willing to sell. The laws of demand and supply still
hold. Trade policy is an example where regulations can redirect economic
forces, but it cannot stop them from manifesting themselves elsewhere.</p>
<p>Flat-panel displays, the displays for laptop computers, tablets, and
flat screen televisions, are an example of such an enduring principle.
In the early 1990s, the vast majority of flat-panel displays used in
U.S.- manufactured laptops were imported, primarily from Japan. The
small but politically powerful U.S. flat-panel- display industry filed a
dumping complaint with the Commerce Department. They argued that
Japanese firms were selling displays at “less than fair value,” which
made it difficult for U.S. firms to compete. This argument for trade
protection is referred to as anti-dumping. Other arguments for
protection in this complaint included national security. After a
preliminary determination by the Commerce Department that the Japanese
firms were dumping, the U.S. International Trade Commission imposed a
63% dumping margin (or tax) on the import of flat-panel displays. Was
this a successful exercise of U.S. trade policy? See what you think
after reading the chapter.</p>

<h2>Introduction to Globalism and Protectionism<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-to-globalism-and-protectionism" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In this chapter, you will learn about:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Protectionism: An Indirect Subsidy from Consumers to Producers</p></li>
<li><p>International Trade and Its Effects on Jobs, Wages, and Working
Conditions</p></li>
<li><p>Arguments in Support of Restricting Imports</p></li>
<li><p>How Trade Policy Is Enacted: Globally, Regionally, and Nationally</p></li>
<li><p>The Tradeoffs of Trade Policy</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The world has become more connected on multiple levels, especially
economically. In 1970, imports and exports made up 11% of U.S. GDP,
while now they make up 32%. However, the United States, due to its size,
is less internationally connected than most countries. For example,
according to the World Bank, 97% of Botswana’s economic activity is
connected to trade. This chapter explores trade policy—the laws and
strategies a country uses to regulate international trade. This topic is
not without controversy.</p>
<p>As the world has become more globally connected, firms and workers in
high-income countries like the United States, Japan, or the nations of
the European Union, perceive a competitive threat from firms in
medium-income countries like Mexico, China, or South Africa, that have
lower costs of living and therefore pay lower wages. Firms and workers
in low-income countries fear that they will suffer if they must compete
against more productive workers and advanced technology in high-income
countries.</p>
<p>On a different tack, some environmentalists worry that multinational
firms may evade environmental protection laws by moving their production
to countries with loose or nonexistent pollution standards, trading a
clean environment for jobs. Some politicians worry that their country
may become overly dependent on key imported products, like oil, which in
a time of war could threaten national security. All of these fears
influence governments to reach the same basic policy conclusion: to
protect national interests, whether businesses, jobs, or security,
imports of foreign products should be restricted. This chapter analyzes
such arguments. First, however, it is essential to learn a few key
concepts and understand how the demand and supply model applies to
international trade.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><span id="bookmark1652">|</span> <span
style=" color: #3767B1;">Protectionism: An Indirect Subsidy from
Consumers to Producers</span><span id="bookmark1660">‌</span></p>
<p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Explain protectionism and its three main forms</p></li>
<li><p>Analyze protectionism through concepts of demand and supply,
noting its effects on equilibrium</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate the effects of trade barriers</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1661">When a government legislates policies to
reduce or block international trade it is engaging in</span>
<strong>protectionism</strong>. Protectionist policies often seek to shield
domestic producers and domestic workers from foreign
competition. Protectionism takes three main forms: tariffs,
import quotas, and nontariff barriers.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1593" id="bookmark1662" class="s34">Recall from</a>
<a href="#bookmark1593" class="a">International Trade</a> <span
class="p">that tariffs are taxes that governments impose on
imported goods and services. This makes imports more expensive
for consumers, discouraging imports. For example, in recent
years large, flat- screen televisions imported to the U.S. from
China have faced a 5% tariff rate.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark1663">Another way to control trade is
through</span> <strong>import quotas</strong>, which are numerical
limitations on the quantity of products that a country can
import. For instance, during the early 1980s, the Reagan
Administration imposed a quota on the import of Japanese
automobiles. In the 1970s, many developed countries, including
the United States, found themselves with declining textile
industries. Textile production does not require highly skilled
workers, so producers were able to set up lower-cost factories
in developing countries. In order to “manage” this loss of jobs
and income, the developed countries established an international
Multifiber Agreement that essentially divided the market for
textile exports between importers and the remaining domestic
producers. The agreement, which ran from 1974 to 2004,</p>
<p>specified the exact quota of textile imports that each developed
country would accept from each low-income country. A similar
story exists for sugar imports into the United States, which are
still governed by quotas.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1664">Nontariff barriers</span> <span
class="p">are all the other ways that a nation can draw up
rules, regulations, inspections, and paperwork to make it more
costly or difficult to import products. A rule requiring certain
safety standards can limit imports just as effectively as high
tariffs or low import quotas, for instance. There are also
nontariff barriers in the form of “rules-of- origin”
regulations; these rules describe the “Made in Country X” label
as the one in which the last substantial change in the product
took place. A manufacturer wishing to evade import restrictions
may try to change the production process so that the last big
change in the product happens in his or her own country. For
example, certain textiles are made in the United States, shipped
to other countries, combined with textiles made in those other
countries to make apparel—and then re-exported back to the
United States for a final assembly, to escape paying tariffs or
to obtain a “Made in the USA” label.</span></p>
<p>Despite import quotas, tariffs, and nontariff barriers, the
share of apparel sold in the United States that is imported rose
from about half in 1999 to about three-quarters today. The U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), estimated the number of U.S.
jobs in textiles and apparel fell from 666,360 in 2007 to
385,240 in 2012, a 42% decline. Even more U.S. textile industry
jobs would have been lost without tariffs. However, domestic
jobs that are saved by import quotas come at a cost. Because
textile and apparel protectionism adds to the costs of imports,
consumers end up paying billions of dollars more for clothing
each year.</p>
<p>When the United States eliminates trade barriers in one area,
consumers spend the money they save on that product elsewhere in
the economy. Thus, while eliminating trade barriers in one
sector of the economy will likely result in some job loss in
that sector, consumers will spend the resulting savings in other
sectors of the economy and hence increase the number of jobs in
those other sectors. Of course, workers in some of the poorest
countries of the world who would otherwise have jobs producing
textiles, would gain considerably if the United States reduced
its barriers to trade in textiles. That said, there are good
reasons to be wary about reducing barriers to trade. The 2012
and 2013 Bangladeshi fires in textile factories, which resulted
in a horrific loss of life, present complications that our
simplified analysis in the chapter will not capture.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1665">Realizing the compromises between
nations that come about due to trade policy, many countries came
together in 1947 to form the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (GATT). (We’ll cover the GATT in more detail later in the
chapter.) This agreement has since been superseded by the</span>
<strong>World Trade Organization (WTO)</strong>, whose membership includes
about 150 nations and most of the world’s economies. It is the
primary international mechanism through which nations negotiate
their trade rules—including rules about tariffs, quotas, and
nontariff barriers. The next section examines the results of
such protectionism and develops a simple model to show the
impact of trade policy.</p>
<p>Demand and Supply Analysis of Protectionism</p>
<p>To the non-economist, restricting imports may appear to be
nothing more than taking sales from foreign producers and giving
them to domestic producers. Other factors are at work, however,
because firms do not operate in a vacuum. Instead, firms sell
their products either to consumers or to other firms (if they
are business suppliers), who are also affected by the trade
barriers. A demand and supply analysis of protectionism shows
that it is not just a matter of domestic gains and foreign
losses, but a policy that imposes substantial domestic costs as
well.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1668" id="bookmark1666" class="s34">Consider two countries, Brazil and the United States, who produce sugar. Each country has a domestic supply and demand for sugar, as</a>
<a href="#bookmark1668" class="a">Table 21.1</a>
<a href="#bookmark1667" class="s34">details and</a>
<a href="#bookmark1667" class="a">Figure 21.2</a> <span
class="p">illustrates. In Brazil, without trade, the equilibrium
price of sugar is 12 cents per pound and the equilibrium output
is 30 tons. When there is no trade in the United States, the
equilibrium price of sugar is 24 cents per pound and the
equilibrium quantity is 80 tons. We label these equilibrium
points as point E in each part of the figure.</span></p>

Brazil and the United States</span> <span class="s37">Before
trade, the equilibrium price of sugar in Brazil is 12 cents a
pound and it is 24 cents per pound in the United States. When
trade is allowed, businesses will buy cheap sugar in Brazil and
sell it in the United States. This will result in higher prices
in Brazil and lower prices in the United States. Ignoring
transaction costs, prices should converge to 16 cents per pound,
with Brazil exporting 15 tons of sugar and the United States
importing 15 tons of sugar. If trade is only partly open between
the countries, it will lead to an outcome between the free-trade
and no-trade possibilities.</span></p>

<p>Table 21.1 The Sugar Trade between Brazil and the United States</p>
<p>If international trade between Brazil and the United States now
becomes possible, profit-seeking firms will spot an opportunity:
buy sugar cheaply in Brazil, and sell it at a higher price in
the United States. As sugar is shipped from Brazil to the United
States, the quantity of sugar produced in Brazil will be greater
than Brazilian consumption (with the extra production exported),
and the amount produced in the United States will be less than
the amount of U.S. consumption (with the extra consumption
imported). Exports to the United States will reduce the sugar
supply in</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1667" class="s34">Brazil, raising its price. Imports into the United States will increase the sugar supply, lowering its price. When the sugar price is the same in both countries, there is no incentive to trade further. As</a>
<a href="#bookmark1667" class="a">Figure 21.2</a> <span
class="p">shows, the equilibrium with trade occurs at a price of
16 cents per pound. At that price, the sugar farmers of Brazil
supply a quantity of 40 tons, while the consumers of Brazil buy
only 25 tons.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1670" id="bookmark1669" class="s34">The extra 15 tons of sugar production, shown by the horizontal gap between the demand curve and the supply curve in Brazil, is exported to the United States. In the United States, at a price of 16 cents, the farmers produce a quantity of 72 tons and consumers demand a quantity of 87 tons. The excess demand of 15 tons by American consumers, shown by the horizontal gap between demand and domestic supply at the price of 16 cents, is supplied by imported sugar. Free trade typically results in income distribution effects, but the key is to recognize the overall gains from trade, as</a>
<a href="#bookmark1670" class="a">Figure 21.3</a>
<a href="#bookmark159" class="s34">shows. Building on the concepts that we outlined in</a>

<a href="#bookmark226" class="s34">and</a>

<a href="#bookmark1670" class="s34">in terms of consumer and producer surplus,</a>
<a href="#bookmark1670" class="a">Figure 21.3</a>
<a href="#bookmark1670" class="s34">(a) shows that producers in Brazil gain by selling more sugar at a higher price, while</a>
<a href="#bookmark1670" class="a">Figure 21.3</a> <span

the lower price and greater availability of sugar. Consumers in
Brazil are worse off (compare their no-trade consumer surplus
with the free-trade consumer surplus) and U.S. producers of
sugar are worse off. There are gains from trade—an increase in
social surplus in each country. That is, both the United States
and Brazil are better off than they would be without trade. The
following Clear It Up feature explains how trade policy can
influence low-income countries.</span></p>

<p>Why are there low-income countries?</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1671">Why are the poor countries of the world
poor? There are a number of reasons, but one of them will
surprise you: the trade policies of the high-income countries.
Following is a stark review of social priorities which the
international aid organization, Oxfam International has widely
publicized.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark1672">High-income countries of the
world—primarily the United States, Canada, countries of the
European Union, and Japan—subsidize their domestic farmers
collectively by about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(360 billion per year. By contrast, the
total amount of foreign aid from these same high-income
countries to the poor countries of the world is about \)</span>70
billion per year, or less than 20% of the farm subsidies. Why
does this matter?</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark1673">It matters because the support of
farmers in high-income countries is devastating to the
livelihoods of farmers in low-income countries. Even when their
climate and land are well-suited to products like cotton, rice,
sugar, or milk, farmers in low-income countries find it
difficult to compete. Farm subsidies in the high- income
countries cause farmers in those countries to increase the
amount they produce. This increase in supply drives down world
prices of farm products below the costs of production. As
Michael Gerson of the</span> <em>Washington Post</em> describes it:
“[T]he effects in the cotton-growing regions of West Africa
are dramatic … keep[ing] millions of Africans on the edge
of malnutrition. In some of the poorest countries on Earth,
cotton farmers are some of the poorest people, earning about a
dollar a day Who benefits from the current<span
id="bookmark1674">‌</span></p>
<p>system of subsidies? About 20,000 American cotton producers,
with an average annual income of more than</p>
<p>$125,000.”</p>
<p>As if subsidies were not enough, often, the high-income
countries block agricultural exports from low-income countries.
In some cases, the situation gets even worse when the
governments of high-income countries, having bought and paid for
an excess supply of farm products, give away those products in
poor countries and drive local farmers out of business
altogether.</p>
<p>For example, shipments of excess milk from the European Union to
Jamaica have caused great hardship for Jamaican dairy farmers.
Shipments of excess rice from the United States to Haiti drove
thousands of low-income rice farmers in Haiti out of business.
The opportunity costs of protectionism are not paid just by
domestic consumers, but also by foreign producers—and for many
agricultural products, those foreign producers are the world’s
poor.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1675">Now, let’s look at what happens with
protectionism. U.S. sugar farmers are likely to argue that, if
only they could be protected from sugar imported from Brazil,
the United States would have higher domestic sugar production,
more jobs in the sugar industry, and American sugar farmers
would receive a higher price. If the United States government
sets a high-enough tariff on imported sugar, or sets an import
quota at zero, the result will be that the quantity of sugar
traded between countries could be reduced to zero, and the
prices in each country will return to the levels before trade
was allowed.</span></p>
<p>Blocking only some trade is also possible. Suppose that the
United States passed a sugar import quota of seven tons. The
United States will import no more than seven tons of sugar,
which means that Brazil can export no more than seven tons of
sugar to the United States. As a result, the price of sugar in
the United States will be 20 cents, which is</p>
<p>the price where the quantity demanded is seven tons greater than
the domestic quantity supplied. Conversely, if Brazil can export
only seven tons of sugar, then the price of sugar in Brazil will
be 14 cents per pound, which is the price where the domestic
quantity supplied in Brazil is seven tons greater than domestic
demand.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_429.png" width="624" height="777" alt="image" />
<p>In general, when a country sets a low or medium tariff or import
quota, the equilibrium price and quantity will be somewhere
between those that prevail with no trade and those with
completely free trade. The following Work It Out explores the
impact of these trade barriers.</p>
<p>Effects of Trade Barriers</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark226" id="bookmark1676" class="s84">Let’s look carefully at the effects of tariffs or quotas. If the U.S. government imposes a tariff or quota sufficient to eliminate trade with Brazil, two things occur: U.S. consumers pay a higher price and therefore buy a smaller quantity of sugar. U.S. producers obtain a higher price and they sell a larger quantity of sugar. We can measure the effects of a tariff on producers and consumers in the United States using two concepts that we developed in</a>
<a href="#bookmark226" class="s43">Demand, Supply, and</a>
Efficiency<span class="s37">: consumer surplus and producer
surplus.</span><span id="bookmark1677">‌</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark1678">Figure 21.4 U.S. Sugar Supply and
Demand</span> <span class="s37">When there is free trade, the
equilibrium is at point A. When there is no trade, the
equilibrium is at point E.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1678" class="s84">Step 1. Look at</a>
<a href="#bookmark1678" class="s43">Figure</a> 21.4<span
class="s37">, which shows a hypothetical version of the demand
and supply of sugar in the United States.</span></p>
<p>Step 2. Note that when there is free trade the sugar market is
in equilibrium at point A where Domestic Quantity Demanded (Qd)
= Quantity Supplied (Domestic Qs + Imports from Brazil) at a
price of P<span class="s63">Trade</span>.</p>
<p>Step 3. Note, also, that imports are equal to the distance
between points C and A.</p>
<p>Step 4. Recall that consumer surplus is the value that consumers
get beyond what they paid for when they buy a product.
Graphically, it is the area under a demand curve but above the
price. In this case, the consumer surplus in the United States
is the area of the triangle formed by the points P<span
class="s63">Trade</span>, A, and B.</p>
<p>Step 5. Recall, also, that producer surplus is another name for
profit—it is the income producers get above the cost of
production, which is shown by the supply curve here. In this
case, the producer surplus with trade is the area of the
triangle formed by the points P<span class="s63">trade</span>,
C, and D.</p>
<p>Step 6. Suppose that the barriers to trade are imposed, imports
are excluded, and the price rises to P<span
class="s63">NoTrade</span>. Look what happens to producer
surplus and consumer surplus. At the higher price, the domestic
quantity supplied increases from Qs to Q at point E. Because
producers are selling more quantity at a higher price, the
producer surplus increases to the area of the triangle P<span
class="s63">NoTrade</span>, E, and D.</p>
<p>Step 7. Compare the areas of the two triangles and you will see
the increase in the producer surplus.</p>
<p>Step 8. Examine the consumer surplus. Consumers are now paying a
higher price to get a lower quantity (Q</p>
<p>instead of Qd). Their consumer surplus shrinks to the area of
the triangle P<span class="s63">NoTrade</span>, E, and B.</p>
<p>Step 9. Determine the net effect. The producer surplus increases
by the area P<span class="s63">trade</span>, C, E, P<span
class="s63">NoTrade</span>. The loss of consumer surplus,
however, is larger. It is the area P<span
class="s63">trade</span>, A, E, P<span
class="s63">NoTrade</span>. In other words, consumers lose more
than producers gain as a result of the trade barriers and the
United States has a lower social surplus.</p>

<p>Using the demand and supply model, consider the impact of
protectionism on producers and consumers in each of the two
countries. For protected producers like U.S. sugar farmers,
restricting imports is clearly positive. Without a need to face
imported products, these producers are able to sell more, at a
higher price. For consumers in the country with the protected
good, in this case U.S. sugar consumers, restricting imports is
clearly negative. They end up buying a lower quantity of the
good and paying a higher price for what they do buy, compared to
the equilibrium price and quantity with trade. The following
Clear It Up feature considers why a country might outsource jobs
even for a domestic product.</p>
<p>Why are Life Savers, an American product, not made in America?</p>
<p>In 1912, Clarence Crane invented Life Savers, the hard candy
with the hole in the middle, in Cleveland, Ohio. Starting in the
late 1960s and for 35 years afterward, a plant in Holland,
Michigan produced 46 billion Life Savers a year, in 200 million
rolls. However, in 2002, the Kraft Company announced that it
would close the Michigan plant and move Life Saver production
across the border to Montreal, Canada.</p>
<p>One reason is that Canadian workers are paid slightly less,
especially in healthcare and insurance costs that are not linked
to employment there. Another main reason is that the United
States government keeps the sugar price high for the benefit of
sugar farmers, with a combination of a government price floor
program and strict quotas on imported sugar. According to the
Coalition for Sugar Reform, from 2009 to 2012, the price of
refined sugar in the United States ranged from 64% to 92% higher
than the world price. Life Saver production uses over 100 tons
of sugar each day, because the candies are 95% sugar.</p>
<p>A number of other candy companies have also reduced U.S.
production and expanded foreign production. From 1997 to 2011,
sugar-using industries eliminated some 127,000 jobs, or more
than seven times the total employment in sugar production. While
the candy industry is especially affected by the cost of sugar,
the costs are spread more broadly. U.S. consumers pay roughly $1
billion per year in higher food prices because of elevated sugar
costs. Meanwhile, sugar producers in low-income countries are
driven out of business. Because of the sugar subsidies to
domestic producers and the quotas on imports, they cannot sell
their output profitably, or at all, in the United States market.</p>
<p>The fact that protectionism pushes up prices for consumers in
the country enacting such protectionism is not always
acknowledged openly, but it is not disputed. After all, if
protectionism did not benefit domestic producers, there would
not be much point in enacting such policies in the first place.
Protectionism is simply a method of requiring consumers to
subsidize producers. The subsidy is indirect, since consumers
pay for it through higher prices, rather than a direct
government subsidy paid with money collected from taxpayers.
However, protectionism works like a subsidy, nonetheless. The
American satirist Ambrose Bierce defined “tariff” this way in
his 1911 book, <em>The Devil’s Dictionary</em>: “Tariff, n. A scale of
taxes on imports, designed to protect the domestic producer
against the greed of his consumer.”</p>
<p>The effect of protectionism on producers and consumers in the
foreign country is complex. When a government uses an import
quota to impose partial protectionism, Brazilian sugar producers
receive a lower price for the sugar they sell in Brazil—but a
higher price for the sugar they are allowed to export to the
United States. Notice that some of the burden of protectionism,
paid by domestic consumers, ends up in the hands of foreign
producers in this case. Brazilian sugar consumers seem to
benefit from U.S. protectionism, because it reduces the price of
sugar that they pay (compared to the free-trade situation). On
the other hand, at least some of these Brazilian sugar consumers
also work</p>
<p>as sugar farmers, so protectionism reduces their incomes and
jobs. Moreover, if trade between the countries vanishes,
Brazilian consumers would miss out on better prices for imported
goods—which do not appear in our single-market example of sugar
protectionism.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1593" class="s34">The effects of protectionism on foreign countries notwithstanding, protectionism requires domestic consumers of a product (consumers may include either households or other firms) to pay higher prices to benefit domestic producers of that product. In addition, when a country enacts protectionism, it loses the economic gains it would have been able to achieve through a combination of comparative advantage, specialized learning, and economies of scale, concepts that we discuss in</a>

Jobs, Wages, and Working Conditions</span><span

<p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Discuss how international trade influences the job market</p></li>
<li><p>Analyze the opportunity cost of protectionism</p></li>
<li><p>Explain how international trade impacts wages, labor standards,
and working conditions</p>
<p>In theory at least, imports might injure workers in several
different ways: fewer jobs, lower wages, or poor working
conditions. Let’s consider these in turn.</p>
<p>Fewer Jobs?</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1680">In the early 1990s, the United States
was negotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)
with Mexico, an agreement that reduced tariffs, import quotas,
and nontariff barriers to trade between the United States,
Mexico, and Canada. H. Ross Perot, a 1992 candidate for U.S.
president, claimed, in prominent campaign arguments, that if the
United States expanded trade with Mexico, there would be a
“giant sucking sound” as U.S. employers relocated to Mexico to
take advantage of lower wages. After all, average wages in
Mexico were, at that time, about one-eighth of those in the
United States. NAFTA passed Congress, President Bill Clinton
signed it into law, and it took effect in 1995. For the next six
years, the United States economy had some of the most rapid job
growth and low unemployment in its history. Those who feared
that open trade with Mexico would lead to a dramatic decrease in
jobs were proven wrong.</span></p>
<p>This result was no surprise to economists. After all, the trend
toward globalization has been going on for decades, not just
since NAFTA. If trade did reduce the number of available jobs,
then the United States should have been seeing a steady loss of
jobs for decades. While the United States economy does
experience rises and falls in unemployment rates—according to
the Bureau of Labor Statistics, from spring 2007 to late 2009,
the unemployment rate rose from 4.4% to 10%. It has since fallen
back to under 5% as of the end of 2016—the number of jobs is not
falling over extended periods of time. The number of U.S. jobs
rose from 71 million in 1970 to 145 million in 2014.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1681">Protectionism certainly saves jobs in
the specific industry being protected but, for two reasons, it
costs jobs in other unprotected industries. First, if consumers
are paying higher prices to the protected industry, they
inevitably have less money to spend on goods from other
industries, and so jobs are lost in those other industries.
Second, if a firm sells the protected product to other firms, so
that other firms must now pay a higher price for a key input,
then those firms will lose sales to foreign producers who do not
need to pay the higher price. Lost sales translate into lost
jobs. The hidden opportunity cost of using protectionism to save
jobs in one industry is jobs sacrificed in other industries.
This is why the United States International Trade Commission, in
its study of barriers to trade, predicts that reducing trade
barriers would not lead to an overall loss of jobs.
Protectionism reshuffles jobs from industries without import
protections to industries that are protected from imports, but
it does not create more jobs.</span><span
id="bookmark1682">‌</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1683" class="s34">Moreover, the costs of saving jobs through protectionism can be very high. A number of different studies have attempted to estimate the cost to consumers in higher prices per job saved through protectionism.</a>
<a href="#bookmark1683" class="a">Table 21.2</a> <span
class="p">shows a sample of results, compiled by economists at
the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. Saving a job through
protectionism typically costs much more than the actual worker’s
salary. For example, a study published in 2002 compiled evidence
that using protectionism to save an average job in the textile
and apparel industry would cost <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(199,000 per job saved. In other
words, those workers could have been paid \)</span>100,000 per year to
be unemployed and the cost would only be half of what it is to
keep them working in the textile and apparel industry. This
result is not unique to textiles and</span></p>
<p>apparel.</p>

<p>Table 21.2 Cost to U.S. Consumers of Saving a Job through
Protectionism <span class="s47">(Source: Federal Reserve Bank of
Dallas)</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark297" class="s34">Why does it cost so much to save jobs through protectionism? The basic reason is that not all of the extra money that consumers pay because of tariffs or quotas goes to save jobs. For example, if the government imposes tariffs on steel imports so that steel buyers pay a higher price, U.S. steel companies earn greater profits, buy more equipment, pay bigger bonuses to managers, give pay raises to existing employees—and also avoid firing some additional workers. Only part of the higher price of protected steel goes toward saving jobs. Also, when an industry is protected, the economy as a whole loses the benefits of playing to its comparative advantage—in other words, producing what it is best at. Therefore, part of the higher price that consumers pay for protected goods is lost economic efficiency, which we can measure as another deadweight loss, like what we discussed in</a>
<a href="#bookmark297" class="a">Labor and Financial</a>
Markets<span class="p">.</span></p>
<p>There’s a bumper sticker that speaks to the threat some U.S.
workers feel from imported products: “Buy American—Save U.S.
Jobs.” If an economist were driving the car, the sticker might
declare: “Block Imports—Save Jobs for Some Americans, Lose Jobs
for Other Americans, and Also Pay High Prices.”</p>
<p>Trade and Wages</p>
<p>Even if trade does not reduce the number of jobs, it could
affect wages. Here, it is important to separate issues about the
average level of wages from issues about whether the wages of
certain workers may be helped or hurt by trade.</p>
<p>Because trade raises the amount that an economy can produce by
letting firms and workers play to their comparative advantage,
trade will also cause the average level of wages in an economy
to rise. Workers who can produce more will be more desirable to
employers, which will shift the demand for their labor out to
the right, and increase wages in the labor market. By contrast,
barriers to trade will reduce the average level of wages in an
economy.</p>
<p>However, even if trade increases the overall wage level, it will
still benefit some workers and hurt others. Workers in
industries that are confronted by competition from imported
products may find that demand for their labor decreases and
shifts back to the left, so that their wages decline with a rise
in international trade. Conversely, workers in industries that
benefit from selling in global markets may find that demand for
their labor shifts out to the right, so that trade raises their
wages.</p>

<span style=" color: #000;">to read an article on the issues
surrounding fair trade coffee.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark1684">One concern is that while globalization
may be benefiting high-skilled, high-wage workers in the United
States, it may also impose costs on low-skilled, low-wage
workers. After all, high-skilled U.S. workers presumably benefit
from increased sales of sophisticated products like computers,
machinery, and pharmaceuticals in which the United States has a
comparative advantage. Meanwhile, low-skilled U.S. workers must
now compete against extremely low- wage workers worldwide for
making simpler products like toys and clothing. As a result, the
wages of low-skilled</span><span id="bookmark1685">‌</span></p>
<p>U.S. workers are likely to fall. There are, however, a number of
reasons to believe that while globalization has helped some U.S.
industries and hurt others, it has not focused its negative
impact on the wages of low-skilled Americans. First, about half
of U.S. trade is intra-industry trade. That means the U.S.
trades similar goods with other high-wage economies like Canada,
Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom. For instance, in 2014
the U.S. exported over 2 million cars, from all the major
automakers, and also imported several million cars from other
countries.</p>
<p>Most U.S. workers in these industries have above-average skills
and wages—and many of them do quite well in the world of
globalization. Some evidence suggested that intra-industry trade
between similar countries had a small impact on domestic workers
but later evidence indicates that it all depends on how flexible
the labor market is. In other words, the key is how flexible
workers are in finding jobs in different industries. The effect
of trade on low- wage workers depends considerably on the
structure of labor markets and indirect effects felt in other
parts of the economy. For example, in the United States and the
United Kingdom, because labor market frictions are low, the
impact of trade on low income workers is small.</p>
<p>Second, many low-skilled U.S. workers hold service jobs that
imports from low-wage countries cannot replace. For example, we
cannot import lawn care services or moving and hauling services
or hotel maids from countries long distances away like China or
Bangladesh. Competition from imported products is not the
primary determinant of their wages.</p>
<p>Finally, while the focus of the discussion here is on wages, it
is worth pointing out that low-wage U.S. workers suffer due to
protectionism in all the industries—even those in which they do
not work. For example, food and clothing are protected
industries. These low-wage workers therefore pay higher prices
for these basic necessities and as such their dollar stretches
over fewer goods.</p>
<p>The benefits and costs of increased trade in terms of its effect
on wages are not distributed evenly across the economy. However,
the growth of international trade has helped to raise the
productivity of U.S. workers as a whole—and thus helped to raise
the average level of wages.</p>
<p>Labor Standards and Working Conditions</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1686">Workers in many low-income countries
around the world labor under conditions that would be illegal
for a worker in the United States. Workers in countries like
China, Thailand, Brazil, South Africa, and Poland are often paid
less than the United States minimum wage. For example, in the
United States, the minimum wage is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(7.25 per hour. A typical
wage in many low-income countries might be more like \)</span>7.25 per
day, or often much less. Moreover, working conditions in
low-income countries may be extremely unpleasant, or even
unsafe. In the worst cases, production may involve the child
labor or even workers who are treated nearly like slaves. These
concerns over foreign labor standards do not affect most of U.S.
trade, which is intra-industry and carried out with other
high-income countries that have labor standards similar to the
United States, but it is, nonetheless, morally and economically
important.</span></p>
<p>In thinking about labor standards in other countries, it is
important to draw some distinctions between what is truly
unacceptable and what is painful to think about. Most people,
economists included, have little difficulty with the idea that
production by six-year-olds confined in factories or by slave
labor is morally unacceptable. They would support aggressive
efforts to eliminate such practices—including shutting out
imported products made with such labor. Many cases, however, are
less clear-cut. An opinion article in the <em>New York Times</em>
several years ago described the case of Ahmed Zia, a 14-year-old
boy from Pakistan. He earned $2 per day working in a carpet
factory. He dropped out of school in second grade. Should the
United States and other countries refuse to purchase rugs made
by Ahmed and his co-workers? If the carpet factories were to
close, the likely alternative job for Ahmed is farm work, and as
Ahmed says of his carpet-weaving job: “This makes much more
money and is more comfortable.”</p>
<p>Other workers may have even less attractive alternative jobs,
perhaps scavenging garbage or prostitution. The real problem for
Ahmed and many others in low-income countries is not that
globalization has made their lives worse, but rather that they
have so few good life alternatives. The United States went
through similar situations during the nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries.</p>
<p>In closing, there is some irony when the United States
government or U.S. citizens take issue with labor standards in
low-income countries, because the United States is not a world
leader in government laws to protect employees. According to a
recent study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD), the U.S. is the only one of 41 countries
that does not provide mandated paid leave for new parents, and
among the 40 countries that do mandate paid leave, the minimum
duration is about two months. Many European workers receive six
weeks or more of paid vacation per year. In the United States,
vacations are often one to three weeks per year. If European
countries accused the United States of using unfair labor
standards to make U.S. products cheaply, and announced that they
would shut out all U.S. imports until the United States adopted
paid parental leave, added more national holidays, and doubled
vacation time, Americans would be outraged. Yet when U.S.
protectionists start talking about restricting imports from poor
countries because of low wage levels and poor working
conditions, they are making a very similar argument. This is not
to say that labor conditions in low-income countries are not an
important issue. They are. However, linking labor conditions in
low-income countries to trade deflects the emphasis from the
real question to ask: “What are acceptable and enforceable
minimum labor standards and protections to have the world over?”</p>

style=" color: #3767B1;">Arguments in Support of Restricting
Imports</span><span id="bookmark1687">‌</span></p>
<p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Explain and analyze various arguments that are in support of
restricting imports, including the infant industry argument, the
anti-dumping argument, the environmental protection argument,
the unsafe consumer products argument, and the national interest
argument</p></li>
<li><p>Explain dumping and race to the bottom</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate the significance of countries’ perceptions on the
benefits of growing trade</p>
<p>As we previously noted, protectionism requires domestic
consumers of a product to pay higher prices to benefit domestic
producers of that product. Countries that institute
protectionist policies lose the economic gains achieved through
a combination of comparative advantage, specialized learning,
and economies of scale. With these overall costs in mind, let us
now consider, one by one, a number of arguments that support
restricting imports.</p>
<p>The Infant Industry Argument</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1530" id="bookmark1688" class="s34">Imagine Bhutan wants to start its own computer industry, but it has no computer firms that can produce at a low enough price and high enough quality to compete in world markets. However, Bhutanese politicians, business leaders, and workers hope that if the local industry had a chance to get established, before it needed to face international competition, then a domestic company or group of companies could develop the skills, management, technology, and economies of scale that it needs to become a successful profit-earning domestic industry. Thus, the infant industry argument for protectionism is to block imports for a limited time, to give the infant industry time to mature, before it starts competing on equal terms in the global economy. (Revisit</a>
<a href="#bookmark1530" class="a">Macroeconomic Policy Around the World</a>
<span class="p">for more information on the infant industry
argument.)</span></p>
<p>The infant industry argument is theoretically possible, even
sensible: give an industry a short-term indirect subsidy</p>
<p>through protection, and then reap the long-term economic
benefits of having a vibrant, healthy industry. Implementation,
however, is tricky. In many countries, infant industries have
gone from babyhood to senility and obsolescence without ever
having reached the profitable maturity stage. Meanwhile, the
protectionism that was supposed to be short-term often took a
very long time to be repealed.</p>
<p>As one example, Brazil treated its computer industry as an
infant industry from the late 1970s until about 1990. In an
attempt to establish its computer industry in the global
economy, Brazil largely barred imports of computer products for
several decades. This policy guaranteed increased sales for
Brazilian computers. However, by the mid-1980s, due to lack of
international competition, Brazil had a backward and out-of-date
industry, typically lagging behind world standards for price and
performance by three to five years—a long time in this
fast-moving industry. After more than a decade, during which
Brazilian consumers and industries that would have benefited
from up-to-date computers paid the costs and Brazil’s computer
industry never competed effectively on world markets, Brazil
phased out its infant industry policy for the computer industry.</p>
<p>Protectionism for infant industries always imposes costs on
domestic users of the product, and typically has provided little
benefit in the form of stronger, competitive industries.
However, several countries in East Asia offer an exception.
Japan, Korea, Thailand, and other countries in this region have
sometimes provided a package of indirect and direct subsidies
targeted at certain industries, including protection from
foreign competition and government loans at interest rates below
the market equilibrium. In Japan and Korea, for example,
subsidies helped get their domestic steel and auto industries up
and running.</p>
<p>Why did the infant industry policy of protectionism and other
subsidies work fairly well in East Asia? An early 1990 World
Bank study offered three guidelines to countries thinking about
infant industry protection:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Do not hand out protectionism and other subsidies to all
industries, but focus on a few industries where your country
has a realistic chance to be a world-class producer.</p></li>
<li><p>Be very hesitant about using protectionism in areas like
computers, where many other industries rely on having the
best products available, because it is not useful to help
one industry by imposing high costs on many other
industries.</p></li>
<li><p>Have clear guidelines for when the infant industry policy
will end.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In Korea in the 1970s and 1980s, a common practice was to link
protectionism and subsidies to export sales in global markets.
If export sales rose, then the infant industry had succeeded and
the government could phase out protectionism. If export sales
did not rise, then the infant industry policy had failed and the
government could phase out protectionism. Either way, the
protectionism would be temporary.</p>

<p>Following these rules is easier said than done. Politics often
intrudes, both in choosing which industries will receive the
benefits of treatment as “infants” and when to phase out import
restrictions and other subsidies. Also, if the country’s
government wishes to impose costs on its citizens so that it can
provide subsidies to a few key industries, it has many tools for
doing such as direct government payments, loans, targeted tax
reductions, and government support of research and development
of new technologies. In other words, protectionism is not the
only or even the best way to support key industries.</p>
<p>The Anti-Dumping Argument</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1689">Dumping</span> <span class="p">refers to
selling goods below their cost of production.
</span>Anti-dumping laws <span class="p">block imports that are
sold below the cost of production by imposing tariffs that
increase the price of these imports to reflect their cost of
production. Since dumping is not allowed under World Trade
Organization (WTO) rules, nations that believe they are on the
receiving end of dumped goods can file a complaint with the WTO.
Anti-dumping complaints have risen in recent years, from about
100 cases per year in the late 1980s to about 200 new cases each
year by the late 2000s. Note that dumping cases are
countercyclical. During recessions, case filings increase.
During economic booms, case filings go down. Individual
countries have also frequently started their own anti-dumping
investigations. The U.S. government has dozens of anti-dumping
orders in place from past investigations. In 2009, for example,
some U.S. imports that were under anti-dumping orders included
pasta from Turkey, steel pipe fittings from Thailand, pressure-
sensitive plastic tape from Italy, preserved mushrooms and lined
paper products from India, and cut-to-length carbon steel and
non-frozen apple juice concentrate from China.</span><span
id="bookmark1690">‌</span></p>
<p>Why Might Dumping Occur?</p>
<p>Why would foreign firms export a product at less than its cost
of production—which presumably means taking a loss? This
question has two possible answers, one innocent and one more
sinister.</p>
<p>The innocent explanation is that demand and supply set market
prices, not the cost of production. Perhaps demand for a product
shifts back to the left or supply shifts out to the right, which
drives the market price to low levels—even below the cost of
production. When a local store has a going-out-of-business sale,
for example, it may sell goods at below the cost of production.
If international companies find that there is excess supply of
steel or computer chips or machine tools that is driving the
market price down below their cost of production—this may be the
market in action.</p>
<p><a href="http://cnx.org/content/m63911/latest/" class="s34">The sinister explanation is that dumping is part of a long-term strategy. Foreign firms sell goods at prices below the cost of production for a short period of time, and when they have driven out the domestic U.S. competition, they then raise prices. Economists sometimes call this scenario predatory pricing, which we discuss in the</a>
<a href="http://cnx.org/content/m63911/latest/" class="a">Monopoly</a>
(<a class="reference external" href="http://cnx.org/content/m63911/latest/">http://cnx.org/content/m63911/latest/</a>) <span
class="p">chapter.</span></p>
<p>Should Anti-Dumping Cases Be Limited?</p>
<p>Anti-dumping cases pose two questions. How much sense do they
make in economic theory? How much sense do they make as
practical policy?</p>
<p>In terms of economic theory, the case for anti-dumping laws is
weak. In a market governed by demand and supply, the government
does not guarantee that firms will be able to make a profit.
After all, low prices are difficult for producers, but benefit
consumers. Moreover, although there are plenty of cases in which
foreign producers have driven out domestic firms, there are zero
documented cases in which the foreign producers then jacked up
prices. Instead, foreign producers typically continue competing
hard against each other and providing low prices to consumers.
In short, it is difficult to find evidence of predatory pricing
by foreign firms exporting to the United States.</p>
<p>Even if one could make a case that the government should
sometimes enact anti-dumping rules in the short term, and then
allow free trade to resume shortly thereafter, there is a
growing concern that anti-dumping investigations often involve
more politics than careful analysis. The U.S. Commerce
Department is charged with calculating the appropriate “cost of
production,” which can be as much an art as a science.</p>
<p>For example, if a company built a new factory two years ago,
should it count part of the factory’s cost in this year’s cost
of production? When a company is in a country where the
government controls prices, like China for example, how can one
measure the true cost of production? When a domestic industry
complains loudly enough, government regulators seem very likely
to find that unfair dumping has occurred. A common pattern has
arisen where a domestic industry files an anti-dumping
complaint, the governments meet and negotiate a reduction in
imports, and then the domestic producers drop the anti-dumping
suit. In such cases, anti-dumping cases often appear to be
little more than a cover story for imposing tariffs or import
quotas.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, the United States, Canada, the European Union,
Australia, and New Zealand implemented almost all the
anti-dumping cases. By the 2000s, countries like Argentina,
Brazil, South Korea, South Africa, Mexico, and India were filing
the majority of the anti-dumping cases before the WTO. As the
number of anti-dumping cases has increased, and as countries
such as the United States and the European Union feel targeted
by the anti-dumping actions of others, the WTO may well propose
some additional guidelines to limit the reach of anti-dumping
laws.</p>
<p>The Environmental Protection Argument</p>
<p>The potential for global trade to affect the environment has
become controversial. A president of the Sierra Club, an
environmental lobbying organization, once wrote: “The
consequences of globalization for the environment are not good.
… Globalization, if we are lucky, will raise average incomes
enough to pay for cleaning up some of the mess that we have
made. But before we get there, globalization could also destroy
enough of the planet’s basic biological and physical systems
that prospects for life itself will be radically compromised.”</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1691">If free trade meant the destruction of
life itself, then even economists would convert to
protectionism! While globalization—and economic activity of all
kinds—can pose environmental dangers, it seems quite possible
that, with the appropriate safeguards in place, we can minimize
the environmental impacts of trade. In some cases, trade may
even bring environmental benefits.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark1692">In general, high-income countries such
as the United States, Canada, Japan, and the nations of the
European Union have relatively strict environmental standards.
In contrast, middle- and low-income countries like Brazil,
Nigeria, India, and China have lower environmental standards.
The general view of the governments of such countries is that
environmental protection is a luxury: as soon as their people
have enough to eat, decent healthcare, and longer life
expectancies, then they will spend more money on items such as
sewage treatment plants, scrubbers to reduce air pollution from
factory smokestacks, and national parks to protect
wildlife.</span><span id="bookmark1693">‌</span></p>
<p>This gap in environmental standards between high-income and
low-income countries raises two worrisome possibilities in a
world of increasing global trade: the “race to the bottom”
scenario and the question of how quickly environmental standards
will improve in low-income countries.</p>
<p>The Race to the Bottom Scenario</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1694">The</span> <strong>race to the bottom</strong>
scenario of global environmental degradation runs like this.
Profit-seeking multinational companies shift their production
from countries with strong environmental standards to countries
with weak standards, thus reducing their costs and increasing
their profits. Faced with such behavior, countries reduce their
environmental standards to attract multinational firms, which,
after all, provide jobs and economic clout. As a result, global
production becomes concentrated in countries where firms can
pollute the most and environmental laws everywhere “race to the
bottom.”</p>
<p>Although the race-to-the-bottom scenario sounds plausible, it
does not appear to describe reality. In fact, the financial
incentive for firms to shift production to poor countries to
take advantage of their weaker environmental rules does not seem
especially powerful. When firms decide where to locate a new
factory, they look at many different factors: the costs of labor
and financial capital; whether the location is close to a
reliable suppliers of the inputs that they need; whether the
location is close to customers; the quality of transportation,
communications, and electrical power networks; the level of
taxes; and the competence and honesty of the local government.
The cost of environmental regulations is a factor, too, but
typically environmental costs are no more than 1 to 2% of the
costs that a large industrial plant faces. The other factors
that determine location are much more important to these
companies than trying to skimp on environmental protection
costs.</p>
<p>When an international company does choose to build a plant in a
low-income country with lax environmental laws, it typically
builds a plant similar to those that it operates in high-income
countries with stricter environmental standards. Part of the
reason for this decision is that designing an industrial plant
is a complex and costly task, and so if a plant works well in a
high-income country, companies prefer to use the same design
everywhere. Also, companies realize that if they create an
environmental disaster in a low-income country, it is likely to
cost them a substantial amount of money in paying for damages,
lost trust, and reduced sales—by building up-to-date plants
everywhere they minimize such risks. As a result of these
factors, foreign-owned plants in low-income countries often have
a better record of compliance with environmental laws than do
locally-owned plants.</p>
<p>Pressuring Low-Income Countries for Higher Environmental
Standards</p>
<p>In some cases, the issue is not so much whether globalization
will pressure low-income countries to reduce their environmental
standards, but instead whether the threat of blocking
international trade can pressure these countries into adopting
stronger standards. For example, restrictions on ivory imports
in high-income countries, along with stronger government efforts
to catch elephant poachers, have been credited with helping to
reduce the illegal poaching of elephants in certain African
countries.</p>
<p>However, it would be highly undemocratic for the well-fed
citizens of high-income countries to attempt to dictate to the
ill-fed citizens of low-income countries what domestic policies
and priorities they must adopt, or how they</p>
<p>should balance environmental goals against other priorities for
their citizens. Furthermore, if high-income countries want
stronger environmental standards in low-income countries, they
have many options other than the threat of protectionism. For
example, high-income countries could pay for anti-pollution
equipment in low-income countries, or could help to pay for
national parks. High-income countries could help pay for and
carry out the scientific and economic studies that would help
environmentalists in low-income countries to make a more
persuasive case for the economic benefits of protecting the
environment.</p>
<p>After all, environmental protection is vital to two industries
of key importance in many low-income countries—agriculture and
tourism. Environmental advocates can set up standards for
labeling products, like “this tuna caught in a net that kept
dolphins safe” or “this product made only with wood not taken
from rainforests,” so that consumer pressure can reinforce
environmentalist values. The United Nations also reinforces
these values, by sponsoring treaties to address issues such as
climate change and global warming, the preservation of
biodiversity, the spread of deserts, and the environmental
health of the seabed. Countries that share a national border or
are within a region often sign environmental agreements about
air and water rights, too. The WTO is also becoming more aware
of environmental issues and more careful about ensuring that
increases in trade do not inflict environmental damage.</p>
<p>Finally, note that these concerns about the race to the bottom
or pressuring low-income countries for more strict environmental
standards do not apply very well to the roughly half of all U.S.
trade that occurs with other high-income countries. Many
European countries have stricter environmental standards in
certain industries than the United States.</p>
<p>The Unsafe Consumer Products Argument</p>
<p>One argument for shutting out certain imported products is that
they are unsafe for consumers. Consumer rights groups have
sometimes warned that the World Trade Organization would require
nations to reduce their health and safety standards for imported
products. However, the WTO explains its current agreement on the
subject in this way: “It allows countries to set their own
standards.” It also says “regulations must be based on science.
And they</p>
<p>should not arbitrarily or unjustifiably discriminate between
countries where identical or similar conditions prevail.” Thus,
for example, under WTO rules it is perfectly legitimate for the
United States to pass laws requiring that <em>all</em> food products or
cars sold in the United States meet certain safety standards
approved by the United States government, whether or not other
countries choose to pass similar standards. However, such
standards must have some scientific basis. It is improper to
impose one set of health and safety standards for domestically
produced goods but a different set of standards for imports, or
one set of standards for imports from Europe and a different set
of standards for imports from Latin America.</p>
<p>In 2007, Mattel recalled nearly two million toys imported from
China due to concerns about high levels of lead in the paint, as
well as some loose parts. It is unclear if other toys were
subject to similar standards. More recently, in 2013, Japan
blocked imports of U.S. wheat because of concerns that
genetically modified (GMO) wheat might be included in the
shipments. The science on the impact of GMOs on health is still
developing.</p>
<p>The National Interest Argument</p>
<p>Some argue that a nation should not depend too heavily on other
countries for supplies of certain key products, such as oil, or
for special materials or technologies that might have national
security applications. On closer consideration, this argument
for protectionism proves rather weak.</p>
<p>As an example, in the United States, oil provides about 36% of
all the energy and 25% of the oil used in the United States
economy is imported. Several times in the last few decades, when
disruptions in the Middle East have shifted the supply curve of
oil back to the left and sharply raised the price, the effects
have been felt across the United States economy. This is not,
however, a very convincing argument for restricting oil imports.
If the United States needs to be protected from a possible
cutoff of foreign oil, then a more reasonable strategy would be
to import 100% of the petroleum supply now, and save U.S.
domestic oil resources for when or if the foreign supply is cut
off. It might also be useful to import extra oil and put it into
a stockpile for use in an emergency, as the United States
government did by starting a Strategic Petroleum Reserve
in 1977. Moreover, it may be necessary to discourage people from
using oil, and to start a high-powered program to seek out
alternatives to oil. A straightforward way to do this would be
to raise taxes on oil. Additionally, it makes no sense to argue
that because oil is highly important to the United States
economy, then the United States should shut out oil imports and
use up its domestic supplies more quickly. U.S. domestic oil
production is increasing. Shale oil is adding to domestic supply
using fracking extraction techniques.</p>
<p>Whether or not to limit certain kinds of imports of key
technologies or materials that might be important to national
security and weapons systems is a slightly different issue. If
weapons’ builders are not confident that they can</p>

<p>How does the United States really feel about expanding trade?</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1695" class="s84">How do people around the world feel about expanding trade between nations? In summer 2007, the Pew Foundation surveyed 45,000 people in 47 countries. One of the questions asked about opinions on growing trade ties between countries.</a>
Table 21.3 <span class="s37">shows the percentages who answered
either “very good” or “somewhat good” for some of countries
surveyed.</span></p>
<p>For those who think of the United States as the world’s leading
supporter of expanding trade, the survey results may be
perplexing. When adding up the shares of those who say that
growing trade ties between countries is “very good” or “somewhat
good,” Americans had the least favorable attitude toward
increasing globalization, while the Chinese and South Africans
ranked highest. In fact, among the 47 countries surveyed, the
United States ranked by far the lowest on this measure, followed
by Egypt, Italy, and Argentina.</p>

<p>continue to obtain a key product in wartime, they might decide
to avoid designing weapons that use this key product, or they
can go ahead and design the weapons and stockpile enough of the
key high-tech components or materials to last through an armed
conflict. There is a U.S. Defense National Stockpile Center that
has built up reserves of many materials, from aluminum oxides,
antimony, and bauxite to tungsten, vegetable tannin extracts,
and zinc (although many of these stockpiles have been reduced
and sold in recent years). Think every country is pro-trade? How
about the U.S.? The following Clear It Up might surprise you.</p>

<p><span id="bookmark1696">One final reason why economists often
treat the</span> <strong>national interest argument</strong> skeptically is
that lobbyists and politicians can tout almost any product as
vital to national security. In 1954, the United States became
worried that it was importing half of the wool required for
military uniforms, so it declared wool and mohair to be
“strategic materials” and began to give subsidies to wool and
mohair farmers. Although the government removed wool from the
official list of “strategic” materials in 1960, the subsidies
for mohair continued for almost 40 years until the government
repealed them in 1993, and then reinstated them in 2002. All too
often, the national interest argument has become an excuse for
handing out the indirect subsidy of protectionism to certain
industries or companies. After all, politicians, not nonpartisan
analysts make decisions about what constitutes a key strategic
material.</p>

<p>These public policy arguments about how nations should react to
globalization and trade are fought out at several levels: at the
global level through the World Trade Organization and through
regional trade agreements between pairs or groups of countries.</p>
<p>The World Trade Organization</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1698">The World Trade Organization (WTO) was
officially born in 1995, but its history is much longer. In the
years after the Great Depression and World War II, there was a
worldwide push to build institutions that would tie the nations
of the world together. The United Nations officially came into
existence in 1945. The World Bank, which assists the poorest
people in the world, and the International Monetary Fund, which
addresses issues raised by international financial transactions,
were both created in 1946. The third planned organization was to
be an International Trade Organization, which would manage
international trade. The United Nations was unable to agree to
this. Instead, 27 nations signed the</span> <strong>General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)</strong> in Geneva, Switzerland on October
30, 1947 to provide a forum in which nations could come together
to negotiate reductions in tariffs and other barriers to trade.
In 1995, the GATT transformed into the WTO.<span
id="bookmark1699">‌</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1700" class="s34">The GATT process was to negotiate an agreement to reduce barriers to trade, sign that agreement, pause for a while, and then start negotiating the next agreement.</a>
<a href="#bookmark1700" class="a">Table 21.4</a> <span
class="p">shows rounds of talks in the GATT, and now the WTO.
Notice that the early rounds of GATT talks took a relatively
short time, included a small number of countries, and focused
almost entirely on reducing tariffs. Since the mid-1960s,
however, rounds of trade talks have taken years, included a
large number of countries, and have included an ever-broadening
range of issues.</span></p>

<p>Table 21.4 The Negotiating Rounds of GATT and the World Trade
Organization</p>
<p>The sluggish pace of GATT negotiations led to an old joke that
GATT really stood for Gentleman’s Agreement to Talk and Talk.
The slow pace of international trade talks, however, is
understandable, even sensible. Having dozens of nations agree to
any treaty is a lengthy process. GATT often set up separate
trading rules for certain industries, like agriculture, and
separate trading rules for certain countries, like the
low-income countries. There were rules, exceptions to rules,
opportunities to opt out of rules, and precise wording to be
fought over in every case. Like the GATT before it, the WTO is
not a world government, with power to impose its decisions on
others. The total staff of the WTO in 2014 is 640 people and its
annual budget (as of 2014) is $197 million, which makes it
smaller in size than many large universities.</p>
<p>Regional Trading Agreements</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1701">There are different types of economic
integration across the globe, ranging from</span> <strong>free trade
agreements</strong>, in which participants allow each other’s imports
without tariffs or quotas, to <strong>common markets</strong>, in which
participants have a common external trade policy as well as free
trade within the group, to full <strong>economic unions</strong>, in which,
in addition to a common market, monetary and fiscal policies are
coordinated. Many nations belong both to the World Trade
Organization and to regional trading agreements.<span
id="bookmark1702">‌</span><span id="bookmark1703">‌</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark1704">The best known of these regional trading
agreements is the European Union. In the years after World War
II, leaders of several European nations reasoned that if they
could tie their economies together more closely, they might be
more likely to avoid another devastating war. Their efforts
began with a free trade association, evolved into a common
market, and then transformed into what is now a full economic
union, known as the European Union. The EU, as it is often
called, has a number of goals. For example, in the early 2000s
it introduced a common currency for Europe, the euro, and phased
out most of the former national forms of money like the German
mark and the French franc, though a few have retained their own
currency. Another key element of the union is to eliminate
barriers to the mobility of goods, labor, and capital across
Europe.</span></p>
<p><span id="bookmark1705">For the United States, perhaps the
best-known regional trading agreement is the North American Free
Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The United States also participates in
some less-prominent regional trading agreements, like the
Caribbean Basin Initiative, which offers reduced tariffs for
imports from these countries, and a free trade agreement with
Israel.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1706" class="s34">The world has seen a flood of regional trading agreements in recent years. About 100 such agreements are now in place.</a>
<a href="#bookmark1706" class="a">Table 21.5</a> <span
class="p">lists a few of the more prominent ones. Some are just
agreements to continue talking. Others set specific goals for
reducing tariffs, import quotas, and nontariff barriers. One
economist described the current trade treaties as a “spaghetti

countries with trade treaties looks like.</span></p>
<p>There is concern among economists who favor free trade that some
of these regional agreements may promise free trade, but
actually act as a way for the countries within the regional
agreement to try to limit trade from anywhere else. In some
cases, the regional trade agreements may even conflict with the
broader agreements of the World Trade Organization.</p>

<p>Trade Policy at the National Level</p>
<p>Yet another dimension of trade policy, along with international
and regional trade agreements, happens at the national level.
The United States, for example, imposes import quotas on sugar,
because of a fear that such imports would drive down the price
of sugar and thus injure domestic sugar producers. One of the
jobs of the United States Department of Commerce is to determine
if there is import dumping from other countries. The United
States International Trade Commission—a government
agency—determines whether the dumping has substantially injured
domestic industries, and if so, the president can impose tariffs
that are intended to offset the unfairly low price.</p>
<p>In the arena of trade policy, the battle often seems to be
between national laws that increase protectionism and
international agreements that try to reduce protectionism, like
the WTO. Why would a country pass laws or negotiate agreements
to shut out certain foreign products, like sugar or textiles,
while simultaneously negotiating to reduce trade barriers in
general? One plausible answer is that international trade
agreements offer a method for countries to restrain their own
special interests. A member of Congress can say to an industry
lobbying for tariffs or quotas on imports: “Sure would like to
help you, but that pesky WTO agreement just won’t let me.”</p>

<p><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/tradepolicy" class="s84">If consumers are the biggest losers from trade, why do they not fight back?

<p>Long-Term Trends in Barriers to Trade</p>
<p>In newspaper headlines, trade policy appears mostly as disputes
and acrimony. Countries are almost constantly threatening to
challenge other nations’ “unfair” trading practices. Cases are
brought to the dispute settlement procedures of the WTO, the
European Union, NAFTA, and other regional trading agreements.
Politicians in national legislatures, goaded on by lobbyists,
often threaten to pass bills that will “establish a fair playing
field” or “prevent unfair trade”—although most such bills seek
to accomplish these high-sounding goals by placing more
restrictions on trade. Protesters in the streets may object to
specific trade rules or to the entire practice of international
trade.</p>
<p>Through all the controversy, the general trend in the last 60
years is clearly toward lower barriers to trade. The average
level of tariffs on imported products charged by industrialized
countries was 40% in 1946. By 1990, after decades of GATT
negotiations, it was down to less than 5%. One of the reasons
that GATT negotiations shifted from focusing on tariff reduction
in the early rounds to a broader agenda was that tariffs had
been reduced so dramatically there was not much more to do in
that area. U.S. tariffs have followed this general pattern:
After rising sharply during the Great Depression, tariffs
dropped off to less than 2% by the end of the century. Although
measures of import quotas and nontariff barriers are less exact
than those for tariffs, they generally appear to be at lower
levels than they had been previously, too.</p>
<p>Thus, the last half-century has seen both a dramatic reduction
in government-created barriers to trade, such as tariffs, import
quotas, and nontariff barriers, and also a number of
technological developments that have made international trade
easier, like advances in transportation, communication, and
information management. The result has been the powerful surge
of international trade.</p>

Tradeoffs of Trade Policy</span><span id="bookmark1707">‌</span></p>
<p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Asses the complexity of international trade</p></li>
<li><p>Discuss why a market-oriented economy is so affected by
international trade</p></li>
<li><p>Explain disruptive market change</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Economists readily acknowledge that international trade is not all
sunshine, roses, and happy endings. Over time, the average person gains
from international trade, both as a worker who has greater productivity
and higher wages because of the benefits of specialization and
comparative advantage, and as a consumer who can benefit from shopping
all over the world for a greater variety of quality products at
attractive prices. The “average person,” however, is hypothetical, not
real—representing a mix of those who have done very well, those who have
done all right, and those who have done poorly. It is a legitimate
concern of public policy to focus not just on the average or on the
success stories, but also on those who have not been so fortunate.
Workers in other countries, the environment, and prospects for new
industries and materials that might be of key importance to the national
economy are also all</p>
<p>legitimate issues.</p>
<p>The common belief among economists is that it is better to embrace the
gains from trade, and then deal with the costs and tradeoffs with other
policy tools, than it is to cut off trade to avoid the costs and
tradeoffs.</p>
<p>To gain a better intuitive understanding for this argument, consider a
hypothetical American company called Technotron. Technotron invents a
new scientific technology that allows the firm to increase the output
and quality of its goods with a smaller number of workers at a lower
cost. As a result of this technology, other U.S. firms in this industry
will lose money and will also have to lay off workers—and some of the
competing firms will even go bankrupt. Should the United States
government protect the existing firms and their employees by making it
illegal for Technotron to use its new technology? Most people who live
in market-oriented economies would oppose trying to block better
products that lower the cost of services. Certainly, there is a case for
society providing temporary support and assistance for those who find
themselves without work. Many would argue for government support of
programs that encourage retraining and acquiring additional skills.
Government might also support research and development efforts, so that
other firms may find ways of outdoing Technotron. Blocking the new
technology altogether, however, seems like a mistake. After all, few
people would advocate giving up electricity because it caused so much
disruption to the kerosene and candle business. Few would suggest
holding back on improvements in medical technology because they might
cause companies selling leeches and snake oil to lose money. In short,
most people view disruptions due to technological change as a necessary
cost that is worth bearing.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1708">Now, imagine that Technotron’s new “technology”
is as simple as this: the company imports what it sells from another
country. In other words, think of foreign trade as a type of innovative
technology. The objective situation is now exactly the same as before.
Because of Technotron’s new technology—which in this case is importing
goods from another county—other firms in this industry will lose money
and lay off workers. Just as it would have been inappropriate and
ultimately foolish to respond to the disruptions of new scientific
technology by trying to shut it down, it would be inappropriate and
ultimately foolish to respond to the disruptions of international trade
by trying to restrict trade.</span></p>
<p>Some workers and firms will suffer because of international trade. In a
living, breathing market-oriented economy, some workers and firms will
always be experiencing disruptions, for a wide variety of reasons.
Corporate management can be better or worse. Workers for a certain firm
can be more or less productive. Tough domestic competitors can create
just as much disruption as tough foreign competitors. Sometimes a new
product is a hit with consumers; sometimes it is a flop. Sometimes a
company is blessed by a run of good luck or stricken with a run of bad
luck. For some firms, international trade will offer great opportunities
for expanding productivity and jobs; for other firms, trade will impose
stress and pain. The disruption caused by international trade is not
fundamentally different from all the other disruptions caused by the
other workings of a market economy.</p>

<p>What’s the Downside of Protection?</p>
<p>The domestic flat-panel display industry employed many workers before
the ITC imposed the dumping margin tax. Flat-panel displays make up a
significant portion of the cost of producing laptop computers—as much as
50%. Therefore, the antidumping tax would substantially increase the
cost, and thus the price, of U.S.- manufactured laptops. As a result of
the ITC’s decision, Apple moved its domestic manufacturing plant for
Macintosh computers to Ireland (where it had an existing plant). Toshiba
shut down its U.S. manufacturing plant for laptops. And IBM cancelled
plans to open a laptop manufacturing plant in North Carolina, instead
deciding to expand production at its plant in Japan. In this case,
rather than having the desired effect of protecting U.S. interests and
giving domestic manufacturing an advantage over items manufactured
elsewhere, it had the unintended effect of driving the manufacturing
completely out of the country. Many</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1709">In other words, the economic analysis of free
trade does not rely on a belief that foreign trade is not disruptive or
does not pose tradeoffs; indeed, the story of Technotron begins with a
particular</span> <strong>disruptive market change</strong>—a new technology—that
causes real tradeoffs. In thinking about the disruptions of foreign
trade, or any of the other possible costs and tradeoffs of foreign trade
discussed in this chapter, the best public policy solutions typically do
not involve protectionism, but instead involve finding ways for public
policy to address the particular issues resulting from these
disruptions, costs, and tradeoffs, while still allowing the benefits of
international trade to occur.</p>

<p>KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY</p>
<ol>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark1660" class="a">Protectionism: An Indirect Subsidy from Consumers to</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark1660">Producers</a></p>
<p>There are three tools for restricting the flow of trade: tariffs,
import quotas, and nontariff barriers. When a country places
limitations on imports from abroad, regardless of whether it uses
tariffs, quotas, or nontariff barriers, it is said to be practicing
protectionism. Protectionism will raise the price of the protected
good in the domestic market, which causes domestic consumers to pay
more, but domestic producers to earn more.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark1679" class="a">International Trade and Its Effects on Jobs, Wages, and Working</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark1679">Conditions</a></p>
<p>As international trade increases, it contributes to a shift in jobs
away from industries where that economy does not have a comparative
advantage and toward industries where it does have a comparative
advantage. The degree to which trade affects labor markets has much
to do with the structure of the labor market in that country and the
adjustment process in other industries. Global trade should raise
the average level of wages by increasing productivity. However, this
increase in average wages may include both gains to workers in
certain jobs and industries and losses to others.</p>
<p>In thinking about labor practices in low-income countries, it is
useful to draw a line between what is unpleasant to think about and
what is morally objectionable. For example, low wages and long
working hours in poor countries are unpleasant to think about, but
for people in low-income parts of the world, it may well be the best
option open to them. Practices like child labor and forced labor are
morally objectionable and many countries refuse to import products
made using these practices.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark1687" class="a">Arguments in Support of Restricting</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark1687">Imports</a></p>
<p>There are a number of arguments that support restricting imports.
These arguments are based around industry and competition,
environmental concerns, and issues of safety and security.</p>
<p>The infant industry argument for protectionism is that small
domestic industries need to be temporarily nurtured and protected
from foreign competition for a time so that they can grow into
strong competitors. In some cases, notably in East Asia, this
approach has worked. Often, however, the infant industries never
grow up. On the other hand, arguments against dumping (which is
setting prices below the cost of production to drive competitors out
of the market), often simply seem to be a convenient excuse for
imposing protectionism.</p>
<p>Low-income countries typically have lower environmental standards
than high-income countries because they are more worried about
immediate basics such as food, education, and healthcare. However,
except for a small number of extreme cases, shutting off trade seems
unlikely to be an effective method of pursuing a cleaner
environment.</p>
<p>Finally, there are arguments involving safety and security. Under
the rules of the World Trade Organization, countries are allowed to
set whatever standards for product safety they wish, but the
standards must be the same for domestic products as for imported
products and there must be a scientific basis for the standard. The
national interest argument for protectionism holds that it is unwise
to import certain key products because if the nation becomes
dependent on key imported supplies, it could be vulnerable to a
cutoff. However, it is often wiser to stockpile resources and to use
foreign supplies when available, rather than preemptively
restricting foreign supplies so as not to become dependent on them.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark1697" class="a">How Governments Enact Trade Policy: Globally, Regionally, and</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark1697">Nationally</a></p>
<p>Governments determine trade policy at many different levels:
administrative agencies within government, laws passed by the
legislature, regional negotiations between a small group of nations
(sometimes just two), and global negotiations through the World
Trade Organization. During the second half of the twentieth century,
trade barriers have, in general, declined quite substantially in the
United States economy and in the global economy. One reason why
countries sign international trade agreements to commit themselves
to free trade is to give themselves protection against their own
special interests. When an industry lobbies for protection from
foreign producers, politicians can point out that, because of the
trade treaty, their hands are tied.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="#bookmark1707" class="a">The Tradeoffs of Trade</a>
<a class="reference external" href="#bookmark1707">Policy</a></p>
<p>International trade certainly has income distribution effects. This
is hardly surprising. All domestic or international competitive
market forces are disruptive. They cause companies and industries to
rise and fall. Government has a role to play in cushioning workers
against the disruptions of the market. However, just as it would be
unwise in the long term to clamp down on new technology and other
causes of disruption in domestic markets, it would be unwise to
clamp down on foreign trade. In both cases, the disruption brings
with it economic benefits.</p>

<li><p>In principle, the benefits of international trade to a country
exceed the costs, no matter whether the country is importing or
exporting. In practice, it is not always possible to compensate
the losers in a country, for example, workers who lose their
jobs due to foreign imports. In your opinion, does that mean
that trade should be inhibited to prevent the losses?</p></li>
<li><p>Economists sometimes say that protectionism is the “second-best”
choice for dealing with any particular problem. What they mean
is that there is often a policy choice that is more direct or
effective for dealing with the problem—a choice that would still
allow the benefits of trade to occur. Explain why protectionism
is a “second-best” choice for:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>helping workers as a group</p></li>
<li><p>helping industries stay strong</p></li>
<li><p>protecting the environment</p></li>
<li><p>advancing national defense</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Trade has income distribution effects. For example, suppose that
because of a government-negotiated reduction in trade barriers,
trade between Germany and the Czech Republic increases. Germany
sells house paint to the Czech Republic. The Czech Republic
sells alarm clocks to Germany. Would you expect this pattern of
trade to increase or decrease jobs and wages in the paint
industry in Germany? The alarm clock industry in Germany? The
paint industry in Czech Republic? The alarm clock industry in
Czech Republic? What has to happen for there to be no increase
in total unemployment in both countries?</p>

<p>In this text, we will use the easiest math possible, and we will
introduce it in this appendix. So if you find some math in the book that
you cannot follow, come back to this appendix to review. Like most
things, math has diminishing returns. A little math ability goes a long
way; the more advanced math you bring in, the less additional knowledge
that will get you. That said, if you are going to major in economics,
you should consider learning a little calculus. It will be worth your
while in terms of helping you learn advanced economics more quickly.</p>

<p><a href="#bookmark14" class="s34">(This appendix should be consulted after first reading</a>
<a href="#bookmark14" class="a">Welcome to</a> Economics!<span
class="p">) Economics is not math. There is no important concept
in this course that cannot be explained without mathematics.
That said, math is a tool that can be used to illustrate
economic concepts. Remember the saying a picture is worth a
thousand words? Instead of a picture, think of a graph. It is
the same thing. Economists use models as the primary tool to
derive insights about economic issues and problems. Math is one
way of working with (or manipulating) economic models.</span></p>
<p>There are other ways of representing models, such as text or
narrative. But why would you use your fist to bang a nail, if
you had a hammer? Math has certain advantages over text. It
disciplines your thinking by making you specify exactly what you
mean. You can get away with fuzzy thinking in your head, but you
cannot when you reduce a model to algebraic equations. At the
same time, math also has disadvantages. Mathematical models are
necessarily based on simplifying assumptions, so they are not
likely to be perfectly realistic. Mathematical models also lack
the nuances which can be found in narrative models. The point is
that math is one tool, but it is not the only tool or even
always the best tool economists can use. So what math will you
need for this book? The answer is: little more than high school
algebra and graphs. You will need to know:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What a function is</p></li>
<li><p>How to interpret the equation of a line (i.e., slope and
intercept)</p></li>
<li><p>How to manipulate a line (i.e., changing the slope or the
intercept)</p></li>
<li><p>How to compute and interpret a growth rate (i.e., percentage
change)</p></li>
<li><p>How to read and manipulate a graph</p></li>
</ul>

<h3><span id="bookmark1745">Algebraic Models</span><a class="headerlink" href="#span-id-bookmark1745-algebraic-models-span" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><span id="bookmark1751">Often economic models (or parts of models) are
expressed in terms of mathematical functions. What is a function? A
function describes a relationship. Sometimes the relationship is a
definition. For example (using words), your professor is Adam Smith.
This could be expressed as Professor = Adam Smith. Or Friends = Bob +
Shawn + Margaret.</span></p>
<p>Often in economics, functions describe cause and effect. The variable on
the left-hand side is what is being explained (“the effect”). On the
right-hand side is what is doing the explaining (“the causes”). For
example, suppose your GPA was determined as follows:</p>
<p>GPA = 0.25 × combined_SAT + 0.25 × class_attendance + 0.50 ×
hours_spent_studying</p>
<p>This equation states that your GPA depends on three things: your
combined SAT score, your class attendance, and the number of hours you
spend studying. It also says that study time is twice as important
(0.50) as either combined_SAT score (0.25) or class_attendance (0.25).
If this relationship is true, how could you raise your GPA? By not
skipping class and studying more. Note that you cannot do anything about
your SAT score, since if you are in college, you have (presumably)
already taken the SATs.</p>
<p>Of course, economic models express relationships using economic
variables, like Budget = money_spent_on_econ_books +
money_spent_on_music, assuming that the only things you buy are
economics books and music.</p>
<p>Most of the relationships we use in this course are expressed as linear
equations of the form:</p>
<p>Expressing Equations Graphically</p>
<p>y = b + mx</p>
<p>Graphs are useful for two purposes. The first is to express equations
visually, and the second is to display statistics or data. This section
will discuss expressing equations visually.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1752">To a mathematician or an economist, a variable
is the name given to a quantity that may assume a range of values. In
the equation of a line presented above, x and y are the variables, with
x on the horizontal axis and y on the vertical axis, and b and m
representing factors that determine the shape of the line. To see how
this equation works, consider a numerical example:</span></p>
<p>y = 9 + 3x</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1753" class="s34">In this equation for a specific line, the b term has been set equal to 9 and the m term has been set equal to 3.</a>
<a href="#bookmark1753" class="a">Table A1</a>
<a href="#bookmark1754" class="s34">shows the values of x and y for this given equation.</a>
<a href="#bookmark1754" class="a">Figure A1</a> <span class="p">shows
this equation, and these values, in a graph. To construct the table,
just plug in a series of different values for x, and then calculate what
value of y results. In the figure, these points are plotted and a line
is drawn through them.</span></p>

<p>Table A1 Values for the Slope Intercept Equation</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_436.jpg" width="286" height="224" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark1754"><span class="s36">Figure A1 Slope and the
Algebra of Straight Lines </span></span>This line graph has <em>x</em> on the
horizontal axis and y on the vertical axis. The y-intercept—that is, the
point where the line intersects the y-axis—is 9. The slope of the line
is 3; that is, there is a rise of 3 on the vertical axis for every
increase of 1 on the horizontal axis. The slope is the same all along a
straight line.</p>
<p>This example illustrates how the b and m terms in an equation for a
straight line determine the shape of the line. The</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1755">b term is called the y-intercept. The reason for
this name is that, if x = 0, then the b term will reveal where the line
intercepts, or crosses, the y-axis. In this example, the line hits the
vertical axis at 9. The m term in the equation for the line is the
slope. Remember that slope is defined as rise over run; more
specifically, the slope of a line from one point to another is the
change in the vertical axis divided by the change in the horizontal
axis. In this example, each time the x term increases by one (the run),
the y term rises by three. Thus, the slope of this line is three.
Specifying a y-intercept and a slope—that is, specifying b and m in the
equation for a line—will identify a specific line. Although it is rare
for real-world data points to arrange themselves as an exact straight
line, it often turns out that a straight line can offer a reasonable
approximation of actual data.</span></p>
<p>Interpreting the Slope</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1762" id="bookmark1756" class="s34">The concept of slope is very useful in economics, because it measures the relationship between two variables. A positive slope means that two variables are positively related; that is, when x increases, so does y, or when x decreases, y decreases also. Graphically, a positive slope means that as a line on the line graph moves from left to right, the line rises. The length-weight relationship, shown in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1762" class="a">Figure A3</a> <span class="p">later in
this Appendix, has a positive slope. We will learn in other chapters
that price and quantity supplied have a positive relationship; that is,
firms will supply more when the price is higher.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1764" id="bookmark1757" class="s34">A negative slope means that two variables are negatively related; that is, when x increases, y decreases, or when x decreases, y increases. Graphically, a negative slope means that, as the line on the line graph moves from left to right, the line falls. The altitude-air density relationship, shown in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1764" class="a">Figure A4</a> <span class="p">later in
this appendix, has a negative slope. We will learn that price and
quantity demanded have a negative relationship; that is, consumers will
purchase less when the price is higher.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1767" class="s34">A slope of zero means that there is no relationship between x and y. Graphically, the line is flat; that is, zero rise over the run.</a>
<a href="#bookmark1767" class="a">Figure A5</a> <span class="p">of the
unemployment rate, shown later in this appendix, illustrates a common
pattern of many line graphs: some segments where the slope is positive,
other segments where the slope is negative, and still other segments
where the slope is close to zero.</span></p>
<p>The slope of a straight line between two points can be calculated in
numerical terms. To calculate slope, begin by designating one point as
the “starting point” and the other point as the “end point” and then
calculating the rise over run between these two points. As an example,
consider the slope of the air density graph between the points
representing an altitude of 4,000 meters and an altitude of 6,000
meters:</p>
<p>Rise: Change in variable on vertical axis (end point minus original
point)</p>
<p>= 0.100 – 0.307</p>
<p>= –0.207</p>
<p>Run: Change in variable on horizontal axis (end point minus original
point)</p>
<p>= 6,000 – 4,000</p>
<p>= 2,000</p>
<p>Thus, the slope of a straight line between these two points would be
that from the altitude of 4,000 meters up to 6,000 meters, the density
of the air decreases by approximately 0.1 kilograms/cubic meter for each
of the next 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Suppose the slope of a line were to increase. Graphically, that means it
would get steeper. Suppose the slope of a line were to decrease. Then it
would get flatter. These conditions are true whether or not the slope
was positive or negative to begin with. A higher positive slope means a
steeper upward tilt to the line, while a smaller positive slope means a
flatter upward tilt to the line. A negative slope that is larger in
absolute value (that is, more negative) means a steeper downward tilt to
the line. A slope of zero is a horizontal flat line. A vertical line has
an infinite slope.</p>
<p>Suppose a line has a larger intercept. Graphically, that means it would
shift out (or up) from the old origin, parallel to the old line. If a
line has a smaller intercept, it would shift in (or down), parallel to
the old line.</p>
<p>Solving Models with Algebra</p>
<p>Economists often use models to answer a specific question, like: What
will the unemployment rate be if the economy grows at 3% per year?
Answering specific questions requires solving the “system” of equations
that represent the model.</p>
<p>Suppose the demand for personal pizzas is given by the following
equation:</p>
<p>Qd = 16 – 2P</p>
<p>where Qd is the amount of personal pizzas consumers want to buy (i.e.,
quantity demanded), and P is the price of pizzas. Suppose the supply of
personal pizzas is:</p>
<p>Qs = 2 + 5P</p>
<p>where Qs is the amount of pizza producers will supply (i.e., quantity
supplied).</p>
<p>Finally, suppose that the personal pizza market operates where supply
equals demand, or</p>
<p>Qd = Qs</p>
<p>We now have a system of three equations and three unknowns (Qd, Qs, and
P), which we can solve with algebra: Since Qd = Qs, we can set the
demand and supply equation equal to each other:</p>
<p>Qd = Qs</p>
<p>16 – 2P = 2 + 5P</p>
<p>Subtracting 2 from both sides and adding 2P to both sides yields:</p>
<p>16 – 2P – 2 = 2 + 5P – 2</p>
<p>14 – 2P = 5P</p>
<p>14 – 2P + 2P = 5P + 2P</p>
<p>14 = 7P</p>
<p>=</p>
<p>14<span class="s16"> </span>7P</p>
<p>7 7</p>
<p>2 = P</p>
<p>In other words, the price of each personal pizza will be <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2. How much
will consumers buy? Taking the price of \)</span>2, and plugging it into the
demand equation, we get:</p>
<p>Qd = 16 – 2P</p>
<p>= 16 – 2(2)</p>
<p>= 16 – 4</p>
<p>= 12</p>
<p>So if the price is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2 each, consumers will purchase 12. How much will
producers supply? Taking the price of \)</span>2, and plugging it into the
supply equation, we get:</p>
<p>Qs = 2 + 5P</p>
<p>= 2 + 5(2)</p>
<p>= 2 + 10</p>
<p>= 12</p>
<p>So if the price is $2 each, producers will supply 12 personal pizzas.
This means we did our math correctly, since Qd</p>
<p>= Qs.</p>
<p>Solving Models with Graphs</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1758" class="s34">If algebra is not your forte, you can get the same answer by using graphs. Take the equations for Qd and Qs and graph them on the same set of axes as shown in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1758" class="a">Figure</a> A2<span class="p">. Since P
is on the vertical axis, it is easiest if you solve each equation for P.
The demand curve is then P = 8 – 0.5Qd and the supply curve is P = –0.4</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>0.2Qs. Note that the vertical intercepts are 8 and –0.4, and the
slopes are –0.5 for demand and 0.2 for supply. If you draw the graphs
carefully, you will see that where they cross (Qs = Qd), the price is $2
and the quantity is 12, just like the algebra predicted.</span></p></li>

<div class="section" id="span-id-bookmark1746-growth-rates-span">
<h3><span id="bookmark1746">Growth Rates</span><a class="headerlink" href="#span-id-bookmark1746-growth-rates-span" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><span id="bookmark1759">Growth rates are frequently encountered in real
world economics. A growth rate is simply the percentage change in some
quantity. It could be your income. It could be a business’s sales. It
could be a nation’s GDP. The formula for computing a growth rate is
straightforward:</span></p>
<p>Quantity</p>
<p>Percentage change = <u>Change in quantity</u></p>
<p>Suppose your job pays <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10 per hour. Your boss, however, is so impressed
with your work that he gives you a \)</span>2 per hour raise. The percentage
change (or growth rate) in your pay is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2/\)</span>10 = 0.20 or 20%.</p>
<p>To compute the growth rate for data over an extended period of time, for
example, the average annual growth in GDP over a decade or more, the
denominator is commonly defined a little differently. In the previous
example, we defined the quantity as the initial quantity—or the quantity
when we started. This is fine for a one-time calculation, but when we
compute the growth over and over, it makes more sense to define the
quantity as the average quantity over the period in question, which is
defined as the quantity halfway between the initial quantity and the
next quantity. This is harder to explain in words than to show with an
example. Suppose a nation’s GDP was <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1 trillion in 2005 and \)</span>1.03
trillion in 2006. The growth rate between 2005 and 2006 would be the
change in GDP (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1.03 trillion – \)</span>1.00 trillion) divided by the average
GDP between 2005 and 2006 (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1.03 trillion + \)</span>1.00 trillion)/2. In other
words:</p>
<p>=</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1.03 trillion – \)</span>1.00 trillion    <span class="s16"> (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1.03
trillion + \)</span>1.00 trillion) / 2</span></p>
<p>=</p>
<p>0.03<span class="s16"> 1.015</span></p>
<p>= 0.0296</p>
<p>= 2.96% growth</p>
<p>Note that if we used the first method, the calculation would be (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1.03
trillion – \)</span>1.00 trillion) / $1.00 trillion</p>
<p>= 3% growth, which is approximately the same as the second, more
complicated method. If you need a rough approximation, use the first
method. If you need accuracy, use the second method.</p>
<p>A few things to remember: A positive growth rate means the quantity is
growing. A smaller growth rate means the quantity is growing more
slowly. A larger growth rate means the quantity is growing more quickly.
A negative growth rate means the quantity is decreasing.</p>
<p>The same change over times yields a smaller growth rate. If you got a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2
raise each year, in the first year the growth rate would be \)</span>2/<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10 =
20%, as shown above. But in the second year, the growth rate would be
\)</span>2/<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(12 = 0.167 or 16.7% growth. In the third year, the same \)</span>2 raise
would correspond to a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2/\)</span>14 = 14.2%. The moral of the story is this: To
keep the growth rate the same, the change must increase each period.</p>

<h3><span id="bookmark1747">Displaying Data Graphically and Interpreting the Graph</span><a class="headerlink" href="#span-id-bookmark1747-displaying-data-graphically-and-interpreting-the-graph-span" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Graphs are also used to display data or evidence. Graphs are a method of
presenting numerical patterns. They</p>
<p>condense detailed numerical information into a visual form in which
relationships and numerical patterns can be seen more easily. For
example, which countries have larger or smaller populations? A careful
reader could examine a long list of numbers representing the populations
of many countries, but with over 200 nations in the world, searching
through such a list would take concentration and time. Putting these
same numbers on a graph can quickly reveal population patterns.
Economists use graphs both for a compact and readable presentation of
groups of numbers and for building an intuitive grasp of relationships
and connections.</p>
<p>Three types of graphs are used in this book: line graphs, pie graphs,
and bar graphs. Each is discussed below. We also provide warnings about
how graphs can be manipulated to alter viewers’ perceptions of the
relationships in the data.</p>
<p>Line Graphs</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1760">The graphs we have discussed so far are called
line graphs, because they show a relationship between two variables: one
measured on the horizontal axis and the other measured on the vertical
axis.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1763" id="bookmark1761" class="s34">Sometimes it is useful to show more than one set of data on the same axes. The data in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1763" class="a">Table A2</a>
<a href="#bookmark1762" class="s34">is displayed in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1762" class="a">Figure A3</a> <span class="p">which
shows the relationship between two variables: length and median weight
for American baby boys and girls during the first three years of life.
(The median means that half of all babies weigh more than this and half
weigh less.) The line graph measures length in inches on the horizontal
axis and weight in pounds on the vertical axis. For example, point A on
the figure shows that a boy who is 28 inches long will have a median
weight of about 19 pounds. One line on the graph shows the length-weight
relationship for boys and the other line shows the relationship for
girls. This kind of graph is widely used by healthcare providers to
check whether a child’s physical development is roughly on track.</span></p>

<p><span id="bookmark1762">Figure A3 The Length-Weight Relationship for
American Boys and Girls</span> <span class="s37">The line graph shows
the relationship between height and weight for boys and girls from birth
to 3 years. Point A, for example, shows that a boy of 28 inches in
height (measured on the horizontal axis) is typically 19 pounds in
weight (measured on the vertical axis). These data apply only to
children in the first three years of life.</span></p>

<a href="#bookmark1765" class="a">Table</a>
A3<a href="#bookmark1764" class="s34">. In this case, the line graph shows how thin the air becomes when you climb a mountain. The horizontal axis of the figure shows altitude, measured in meters above sea level. The vertical axis measures the density of the air at each altitude. Air density is measured by the weight of the air in a cubic meter of space (that is, a box measuring one meter in height, width, and depth). As the graph shows, air pressure is heaviest at ground level and becomes lighter as you climb.</a>
<a href="#bookmark1764" class="a">Figure A4</a> <span class="p">shows
that a cubic meter of air at an altitude of 500 meters weighs
approximately one kilogram (about 2.2 pounds). However, as the altitude
increases, air density decreases. A cubic meter of air at the top of
Mount Everest, at about 8,828 meters, would weigh only 0.023 kilograms.
The thin air at high altitudes explains why many mountain climbers need
to use oxygen tanks as they reach the top of a mountain.</span></p>

<p>Table A3 Altitude to Air Density Relationship</p>
<p>The length-weight relationship and the altitude-air density
relationships in these two figures represent averages. If you were to
collect actual data on air pressure at different altitudes, the same
altitude in different geographic locations will have slightly different
air density, depending on factors like how far you are from the equator,
local weather conditions, and the humidity in the air. Similarly, in
measuring the height and weight of children for the previous line graph,
children of a particular height would have a range of different weights,
some above average and some below. In the real world, this sort of
variation in data is common. The task of a researcher is to organize
that data in a way that helps to understand typical patterns. The study
of statistics, especially when combined with computer statistics and
spreadsheet programs, is a great help in organizing this kind of data,
plotting line graphs, and looking for typical underlying relationships.
For most economics and social science majors, a statistics course will
be required at some point.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1767" id="bookmark1766" class="s34">One common line graph is called a time series, in which the horizontal axis shows time and the vertical axis displays another variable. Thus, a time series graph shows how a variable changes over time.</a>
<a href="#bookmark1767" class="a">Figure</a> A5 <span class="p">shows
the unemployment rate in the United States since 1975, where
unemployment is defined as the percentage of adults who want jobs and
are looking for a job, but cannot find one. The points for the
unemployment rate in each year are plotted</span></p>
<p>on the graph, and a line then connects the points, showing how the
unemployment rate has moved up and down since 1975. The line graph makes
it easy to see, for example, that the highest unemployment rate during
this time period was slightly less than 10% in the early 1980s and 2010,
while the unemployment rate declined from the early 1990s to the end of
the 1990s, before rising and then falling back in the early 2000s, and
then rising sharply during the recession from 2008–2009.</p>

the bars can represent countries or years, and how the vertical axis can
represent a numerical or a percentage value. Bar graphs can also compare

<p>Comparing Line Graphs with Pie Charts and Bar Graphs</p>
<p>Now that you are familiar with pie graphs, bar graphs, and line graphs,
how do you know which graph to use for your data? Pie graphs are often
better than line graphs at showing how an overall group is divided.
However, if a pie graph has too many slices, it can become difficult to
interpret.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1772" class="s34">Bar graphs are especially useful when comparing quantities. For example, if you are studying the populations of different countries, as in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1772" class="a">Figure</a> A7<span class="p">, bar
graphs can show the relationships between the population sizes of
multiple countries. Not only can it show these relationships, but it can
also show breakdowns of different groups within the population.</span></p>
<p>A line graph is often the most effective format for illustrating a
relationship between two variables that are both changing. For example,
time series graphs can show patterns as time changes, like the
unemployment rate over time.</p>
<p>Line graphs are widely used in economics to present continuous data
about prices, wages, quantities bought and sold, the size of the
economy.</p>
<p>How Graphs Can Be Misleading</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1775" class="s34">Graphs not only reveal patterns; they can also alter how patterns are perceived. To see some of the ways this can be done, consider the line graphs of</a>
<a href="#bookmark1775" class="a">Figure</a>
A9<a href="#bookmark1776" class="s34">,</a>
<a href="#bookmark1776" class="a">Figure</a>
A10<a href="#bookmark1777" class="s34">, and</a>
<a href="#bookmark1777" class="a">Figure</a> A11<span class="p">. These

perspectives.</span></p>

<p><span id="bookmark1777">Figure A11 Presenting Unemployment Rates in
Different Ways, All of Them Accurate</span> <span class="s37">Simply
changing the width and height of the area in which data is displayed can
alter the perception of the data.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1775" class="s34">Suppose you wanted a graph which gives the impression that the rise in unemployment in 2009 was not all that large, or all that extraordinary by historical standards. You might choose to present your data as in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1775" class="a">Figure A9</a>
<a href="#bookmark1775" class="s34">(a).</a>
<a href="#bookmark1775" class="a">Figure A9</a>
<a href="#bookmark1767" class="s34">(a) includes much of the same data presented earlier in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1767" class="a">Figure</a>
A5<a href="#bookmark1775" class="s34">, but stretches the horizontal axis out longer relative to the vertical axis. By spreading the graph wide and flat, the visual appearance is that the rise in unemployment is not so large, and is similar to some past rises in unemployment. Now imagine you wanted to emphasize how unemployment spiked substantially higher in 2009. In this case, using the same data, you can stretch the vertical axis out relative to the horizontal axis, as in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1775" class="a">Figure A9</a> <span class="p">(b),
which makes all rises and falls in unemployment appear larger.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1776" class="s34">A similar effect can be accomplished without changing the length of the axes, but by changing the scale on the vertical axis. In</a>
<a href="#bookmark1776" class="a">Figure A10</a>
<a href="#bookmark1776" class="s34">(c), the scale on the vertical axis runs from 0% to 30%, while in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1776" class="a">Figure A10</a>
<a href="#bookmark1767" class="s34">(d), the vertical axis runs from 3% to 10%. Compared to</a>
Figure
A5<a href="#bookmark1776" class="s34">, where the vertical scale runs from 0% to 12%,</a>
<a href="#bookmark1776" class="a">Figure A10</a>
<a href="#bookmark1776" class="s34">(c) makes the fluctuation in unemployment look smaller, while</a>
<a href="#bookmark1776" class="a">Figure A10</a> <span class="p">(d)
makes it look larger.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1776" class="s34">Another way to alter the perception of the graph is to reduce the amount of variation by changing the number of points plotted on the graph.</a>
<a href="#bookmark1776" class="a">Figure A10</a>
<a href="#bookmark1777" class="s34">(e) shows the unemployment rate according to five-year averages. By averaging out some of the year-to-year changes, the line appears smoother and with fewer highs and lows. In reality, the unemployment rate is reported monthly, and</a>
<a href="#bookmark1777" class="a">Figure A11</a>
<a href="#bookmark1777" class="s34">(f) shows the monthly figures since 1960, which fluctuate more than the five-year average.</a>
<a href="#bookmark1777" class="a">Figure A11</a> <span class="p">(f) is
also a vivid illustration of how graphs can compress lots of data. The
graph includes monthly data since 1960, which over almost 50 years,
works out to nearly 600 data points.</span></p>
<p>Reading that list of 600 data points in numerical form would be
hypnotic. You can, however, get a good intuitive sense of these 600 data
points very quickly from the graph.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1777" class="s34">A final trick in manipulating the perception of graphical information is that, by choosing the starting and ending points carefully, you can influence the perception of whether the variable is rising or falling. The original data show a general pattern with unemployment low in the 1960s, but spiking up in the mid-1970s, early 1980s, early 1990s, early 2000s, and late 2000s.</a>
<a href="#bookmark1777" class="a">Figure A11</a> <span class="p">(g),
however, shows a graph that goes back only to 1975, which gives an
impression that unemployment was more-or-less gradually falling over
time until the 2009 recession pushed it back up to its “original”
level—which is a plausible interpretation if one starts at the high
point around 1975.</span></p>
<p>These kinds of tricks—or shall we just call them “presentation choices”—
are not limited to line graphs. In a pie chart with many small slices
and one large slice, someone must decided what categories should be used
to produce these slices in the first place, thus making some slices
appear bigger than others. If you are making a bar graph, you can make
the vertical axis either taller or shorter, which will tend to make
variations in the height of the bars appear more or less.</p>
<p>Being able to read graphs is an essential skill, both in economics and
in life. A graph is just one perspective or point of view, shaped by
choices such as those discussed in this section. Do not always believe
the first quick impression from a graph. View with caution.</p>

<h3><span id="bookmark1748">Key Concepts and Summary</span><a class="headerlink" href="#span-id-bookmark1748-key-concepts-and-summary-span" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Math is a tool for understanding economics and economic relationships
can be expressed mathematically using algebra or graphs. The algebraic
equation for a line is y = b + mx, where x is the variable on the
horizontal axis and y is the variable on the vertical axis, the b term
is the y-intercept and the m term is the slope. The slope of a line is
the same at any point on the line and it indicates the relationship
(positive, negative, or zero) between two economic variables.</p>
<p>Economic models can be solved algebraically or graphically. Graphs allow
you to illustrate data visually. They can illustrate patterns,
comparisons, trends, and apportionment by condensing the numerical data
and providing an intuitive sense of relationships in the data. A line
graph shows the relationship between two variables: one is shown on the
horizontal axis and one on the vertical axis. A pie graph shows how
something is allotted, such as a sum of money or a group of people. The
size of each slice of the pie is drawn to represent the corresponding
percentage of the whole. A bar graph uses the height of bars to show a
relationship, where each bar represents a certain entity, like a country
or a group of people. The bars on a bar graph can also be divided into
segments to show subgroups.</p>
<p>Any graph is a single visual perspective on a subject. The impression it
leaves will be based on many choices, such as what data or time frame is
included, how data or groups are divided up, the relative size of
vertical and horizontal axes, whether the scale used on a vertical
starts at zero. Thus, any graph should be regarded somewhat skeptically,
remembering that the underlying relationship can be open to different
interpretations.</p>

class="p">.) The fundamental ideas of Keynesian economics were developed
before the AD/AS model was popularized. From the 1930s until the 1970s,
Keynesian economics was usually explained with a different model, known
as the expenditure-output approach. This approach is strongly rooted in
the fundamental assumptions of Keynesian economics: it focuses on the
total amount of spending in the economy, with no explicit mention of
aggregate supply or of the price level (although as you will see, it is
possible to draw some inferences about aggregate supply and price levels
based on the diagram).</span></p>

<p><span id="bookmark1790">Figure B1 The Expenditure-Output Diagram</span>
<span class="s37">The aggregate expenditure-output model shows aggregate
expenditures on the vertical axis and real GDP on the horizontal axis. A
vertical line shows potential GDP where full employment occurs. The
45-degree line shows all points where aggregate expenditures and output
are equal. The aggregate expenditure schedule shows how total spending
or aggregate expenditure increases as output or real GDP rises. The
intersection of the aggregate expenditure schedule and the 45-degree
line will be the equilibrium.</span></p>
<p>Equilibrium occurs at E<span class="s63">0</span>, where aggregate
expenditure AE<span class="s63">0</span> is equal to the output level
Y<span class="s63">0</span>.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1791">Remember that GDP can be thought of in several
equivalent ways: it measures both the value of spending on final goods
and also the value of the production of final goods. All sales of the
final goods and services that make up GDP will eventually end up as
income for workers, for managers, and for investors and owners of firms.
The sum of all the income received for contributing resources to GDP is
called national income (Y). At some points in the discussion that
follows, it will be useful to refer to real GDP as “national income.”
Both axes are measured in real (inflation- adjusted) terms.</span></p>
<p>The Potential GDP Line and the 45-degree Line</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1792">The Keynesian cross diagram contains two lines
that serve as conceptual guideposts to orient the discussion. The first
is a vertical line showing the level of potential GDP. Potential GDP
means the same thing here that it means in the AD/AS diagrams: it refers
to the quantity of output that the economy can produce with full
employment of its labor and physical capital.</span></p>
<p>The second conceptual line on the Keynesian cross diagram is the
45-degree line, which starts at the origin and reaches up and to the
right. A line that stretches up at a 45-degree angle represents the set
of points (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3) and so on, where the measurement on the
vertical axis is equal to the measurement on the horizontal axis. In
this diagram, the 45-degree line shows the set of points where the level
of aggregate expenditure in the economy, measured on the vertical axis,
is equal to the level of output or national income in the economy,
measured by GDP on the horizontal axis.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1793">When the macroeconomy is in equilibrium, it must
be true that the aggregate expenditures in the economy are equal to the
real GDP—because by definition, GDP is the measure of what is spent on
final sales of goods and services in the economy. Thus, the equilibrium
calculated with a Keynesian cross diagram will always end up where
aggregate expenditure and output are equal—which will only occur along
the 45-degree line.</span></p>
<p>The Aggregate Expenditure Schedule</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1794">The final ingredient of the Keynesian cross or
expenditure-output diagram is the aggregate expenditure schedule, which
will show the total expenditures in the economy for each level of real
GDP. The intersection of the aggregate expenditure line with the
45-degree line—at point E</span><span class="s60">0</span>
<a href="#bookmark1790" class="s34">in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1790" class="a">Figure</a> <span
class="s54">B1</span>—will show the equilibrium for the economy, because
it is the point where aggregate expenditure is equal to output or real
GDP. After developing an understanding of what the aggregate
expenditures schedule means, we will return to this equilibrium and how
to interpret it.</p>

<h3><span id="bookmark1780">Building the Aggregate Expenditure Schedule</span><a class="headerlink" href="#span-id-bookmark1780-building-the-aggregate-expenditure-schedule-span" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Aggregate expenditure is the key to the expenditure-income model. The
aggregate expenditure schedule shows, either in the form of a table or a
graph, how aggregate expenditures in the economy rise as real GDP or
national income rises. Thus, in thinking about the components of the
aggregate expenditure line—consumption, investment, government spending,
exports and imports—the key question is how expenditures in each
category will adjust as national income rises.</p>
<p>Consumption as a Function of National Income</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1795">How do consumption expenditures increase as
national income rises? People can do two things with their income:
consume it or save it (for the moment, let’s ignore the need to pay
taxes with some of it). Each person who receives an additional dollar
faces this choice. The marginal propensity to consume (MPC), is the
share of the additional dollar of income a person decides to devote to
consumption expenditures. The marginal propensity to save (MPS) is the
share of the additional dollar a person decides to save. It must always
hold true that:</span><span id="bookmark1796">‌</span></p>
<p>MPC + MPS = 1</p>
<p>For example, if the marginal propensity to consume out of the marginal
amount of income earned is 0.9, then the marginal propensity to save is
0.1.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1798" class="s34">With this relationship in mind, consider the relationship among income, consumption, and savings shown in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1798" class="a">Figure</a> B2<span class="p">. (Note
that we use “Aggregate Expenditure” on the vertical axis in this and the
following figures, because all consumption expenditures are parts of
aggregate expenditures.)</span></p>
<p>An assumption commonly made in this model is that even if income were
zero, people would have to consume something. In this example,
consumption would be <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(600 even if income were zero. Then, the MPC is 0.8
and the MPS is 0.2. Thus, when income increases by \)</span>1,000, consumption
rises by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(800 and savings rises by \)</span>200. At an income of</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1798" id="bookmark1797" class="s34"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(4,000, total consumption will be the \)</span>600 that would be consumed even without any income, plus <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(4,000 multiplied by the marginal propensity to consume of 0.8, or \)</span> 3,200, for a total of $ 3,800. The total amount of consumption and saving must always add up to the total amount of income. (Exactly how a situation of zero income and negative savings would work in practice is not important, because even low-income societies are not literally at zero income, so the point is hypothetical.) This relationship between income and consumption, illustrated in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1798" class="a">Figure B2</a>
<a href="#bookmark1799" class="s34">and</a>
<a href="#bookmark1799" class="a">Table B</a>1<span class="p">, is
called the consumption function.</span></p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_448.jpg" width="301" height="237" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark1798">Figure B2 The Consumption Function</span> <span
class="s37">In the expenditure-output model, how does consumption
increase with the level of national income? Output on the horizontal
axis is conceptually the same as national income, since the value of all
final output that is produced and sold must be income to someone,
somewhere in the economy. At a national income level of zero, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(600 is
consumed. Then, each time income rises by \)</span>1,000, consumption rises by
$800, because in this example, the marginal propensity to consume is
0.8.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1799" class="s34">The pattern of consumption shown in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1799" class="a">Table B1</a>
<a href="#bookmark1798" class="s34">is plotted in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1798" class="a">Figure</a> B2<span class="p">. To
calculate consumption, multiply the income level by 0.8, for the
marginal propensity to consume, and add $600, for the amount that would
be consumed even if income was zero. Consumption plus savings must be
equal to income.</span></p>

<p>Table B1 The Consumption Function</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1799" class="s34">However, a number of factors other than income can also cause the entire consumption function to shift. These factors were summarized in the earlier discussion of consumption, and listed in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1799" class="a">Table</a> B1<span class="p">. When the
consumption function moves, it can shift in two ways: either the entire
consumption function can move up or down in a parallel manner, or the
slope of the consumption function can shift so that it becomes steeper
or flatter. For example, if a tax cut leads consumers to spend more, but
does not affect their marginal propensity to consume, it would cause an
upward shift to a new consumption function that is parallel to the
original one. However, a change in household preferences for saving that
reduced the marginal propensity to save would cause the slope of the
consumption function to become steeper: that is, if the savings rate is
lower, then every increase in income leads to a larger rise in
consumption.</span></p>
<p>Investment as a Function of National Income</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1800">Investment decisions are forward-looking, based
on expected rates of return. Precisely because investment decisions
depend primarily on perceptions about future economic conditions, they
do</span> <em>not</em>
<a href="#bookmark1801" class="s34">depend primarily on the level of GDP in the current year. Thus, on a Keynesian cross diagram, the investment function can be drawn as a horizontal line, at a fixed level of expenditure.</a>
<a href="#bookmark1801" class="a">Figure B3</a><span class="s54">
</span>shows an investment function where the level of investment is,
for the sake of concreteness, set at the specific level of 500. Just as
a consumption function shows the relationship between consumption levels
and real GDP (or national income), the investment function shows the
relationship between investment levels and real GDP.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_449.jpg" width="339" height="230" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark1801">Figure B3 The Investment Function</span> <span
class="s37">The investment function is drawn as a flat line because
investment is based on interest rates and expectations about the future,
and so it does not change with the level of current national income. In
this example, investment expenditures are at a level of 500. However,
changes in factors like technological opportunities, expectations about
near-term economic growth, and interest rates would all cause the
investment function to shift up or down.</span></p>
<p>The appearance of the investment function as a horizontal line does not
mean that the level of investment never moves. It means only that in the
context of this two-dimensional diagram, the level of investment on the
vertical aggregate expenditure axis does not vary according to the
current level of real GDP on the horizontal axis. However, all the other
factors that vary investment—new technological opportunities,
expectations about near-term economic growth, interest rates, the price
of key inputs, and tax incentives for investment—can cause the
horizontal investment function to shift up or down.</p>
<p>Government Spending and Taxes as a Function of National Income</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1802" class="s34">In the Keynesian cross diagram, government spending appears as a horizontal line, as in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1802" class="a">Figure</a> B4<span class="p">, where
government spending is set at a level of 1,300. As in the case of
investment spending, this horizontal line does not mean that government
spending is unchanging. It means only that government spending changes
when Congress decides on a change in the budget, rather than shifting in
a predictable way with the current size of the real GDP shown on the
horizontal axis.</span></p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_450.jpg" width="339" height="235" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark1802">Figure B4 The Government Spending
Function</span> <span class="s37">The level of government spending is
determined by political factors, not by the level of real GDP in a given
year. Thus, government spending is drawn as a horizontal line. In this
example, government spending is at a level of 1,300. Congressional
decisions to increase government spending will cause this horizontal
line to shift up, while decisions to reduce spending would cause it to
shift down.</span></p>
<p>The situation of taxes is different because taxes often rise or fall
with the volume of economic activity. For example, income taxes are
based on the level of income earned and sales taxes are based on the
amount of sales made, and both income and sales tend to be higher when
the economy is growing and lower when the economy is in a recession. For
the purposes of constructing the basic Keynesian cross diagram, it is
helpful to view taxes as a proportionate share of GDP. In the United
States, for example, taking federal, state, and local taxes together,
government typically collects about 30–35 % of income as taxes.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1804" class="a">Table B2</a> <span class="p">revises
the earlier table on the consumption function so that it takes taxes
into account. The first column shows national income. The second column
calculates taxes, which in this example are set at a rate of 30%,
or</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1803" class="s34">0.3. The third column shows after-tax income; that is, total income minus taxes. The fourth column then calculates consumption in the same manner as before: multiply after-tax income by 0.8, representing the marginal propensity to consume, and then add $600, for the amount that would be consumed even if income was zero. When taxes are included, the marginal propensity to consume is reduced by the amount of the tax rate, so each additional dollar of income results in a smaller increase in consumption than before taxes. For this reason, the consumption function, with taxes included, is flatter than the consumption function without taxes, as</a>
<a href="#bookmark1803" class="a">Figure B5</a> <span
class="p">shows.</span></p>

<p>Exports and Imports as a Function of National Income</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1805" class="s34">The export function, which shows how exports change with the level of a country’s own real GDP, is drawn as a horizontal line, as in the example in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1805" class="a">Figure B6</a> <span class="p">(a)
where exports are drawn at a level of $840. Again, as in the case of
investment spending and government spending, drawing the export function
as horizontal does not imply that exports never change. It just means
that they do not change because of what is on the horizontal axis—that
is, a country’s own level of domestic production—and instead are shaped
by the level of aggregate demand in other countries. More demand for
exports from other countries would cause the export function to shift
up; less demand for exports from other countries would cause it to shift
down.</span></p>

<p><span id="bookmark1805">Figure B6 The Export and Import Functions</span>
<span class="s37">(a) The export function is drawn as a horizontal line
because exports are determined by the buying power of other countries
and thus do not change with the size of the domestic economy. In this
example, exports are set at 840. However, exports can shift up or down,
depending on buying patterns in other countries. (b) The import function
is drawn in negative territory because expenditures on imported products
are a subtraction from expenditures in the domestic economy. In this
example, the marginal propensity to import is 0.1, so imports are
calculated by multiplying the level of income by –0.1.</span></p>

<p><a href="#bookmark1805" id="bookmark1806" class="s34">by the marginal propensity to import (MPI), out of national income. In</a>
<a href="#bookmark1805" class="a">Figure B6</a> <span class="p">(b), the
marginal propensity to import is 0.1. Thus, if real GDP is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(5,000,

on. The import function is drawn as downward sloping and negative,
because it represents a subtraction from the aggregate expenditures in
the domestic economy. A change in the marginal propensity to import,
perhaps as a result of changes in preferences, would alter the slope of
the import function.</span></p>
<p>Using an Algebraic Approach to the Expenditure-Output Model</p>
<p>In the expenditure-output or Keynesian cross model, the equilibrium
occurs where the aggregate expenditure line (AE line) crosses the
45-degree line. Given algebraic equations for two lines, the point where
they cross can be readily calculated. Imagine an economy with the
following characteristics.</p>
<p>Y = Real GDP or national income T = Taxes = 0.3Y</p>
<p>C = Consumption = 140 + 0.9(Y – T) I = Investment = 400</p>
<p>G = Government spending = 800 X = Exports = 600</p>
<p>M = Imports = 0.15Y</p>
<p>Step 1. Determine the aggregate expenditure function. In this case, it
is:</p>
<p>AE = C + I + G + X – M</p>
<p>AE = 140 + 0.9(Y – T) + 400 + 800 + 600 – 0.15Y</p>
<p>Step 2. The equation for the 45-degree line is the set of points where
GDP or national income on the horizontal axis is equal to aggregate
expenditure on the vertical axis. Thus, the equation for the 45-degree
line is: AE = Y.</p>
<p>Step 3. The next step is to solve these two equations for Y (or AE,
since they will be equal to each other). Substitute Y for AE:</p>
<p>Y = 140 + 0.9(Y – T) + 400 + 800 + 600 – 0.15Y</p>
<p>Step 4. Insert the term 0.3Y for the tax rate T. This produces an
equation with only one variable, Y. Step 5. Work through the algebra and
solve for Y.</p>
<p>Y = 140 + 0.9(Y – 0.3Y) + 400 + 800 + 600 – 0.15Y Y = 140 + 0.9Y – 0.27Y</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>1800 – 0.15Y</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Y = 1940 + 0.48Y</p>
<p>=</p>
<p>Y – 0.48Y = 1940 0.52Y = 1940</p>
<p>0.52Y</p>
<p>0.52</p>
<p>1940</p>
<p>0.52</p>
<p>Y = 3730</p>
<p>This algebraic framework is flexible and useful in predicting how
economic events and policy actions will affect real GDP.</p>
<p>Step 6. Say, for example, that because of changes in the relative prices
of domestic and foreign goods, the marginal propensity to import falls
to 0.1. Calculate the equilibrium output when the marginal propensity to
import is changed to 0.1.</p>
<p>Y = 140 + 0.9(Y – 0.3Y) + 400 + 800 + 600 – 0.1Y Y = 1940 – 0.53Y</p>
<p>0.47Y = 1940</p>
<p>Y = 4127</p>
<p>Step 7. Because of a surge of business confidence, investment rises to
500. Calculate the equilibrium output.</p>
<p>Y = 140 + 0.9(Y – 0.3Y) + 500 + 800 + 600 – 0.15Y Y = 2040 + 0.48Y</p>
<p>Y – 0.48Y = 2040</p>
<p>0.52Y = 2040</p>
<p>Y = 3923</p>
<p>For issues of policy, the key questions would be how to adjust
government spending levels or tax rates so that the equilibrium level of
output is the full employment level. In this case, let the economic
parameters be:</p>
<p>Y = National income T = Taxes = 0.3Y</p>
<p>C = Consumption = 200 + 0.9(Y – T) I = Investment = 600</p>
<p>G = Government spending = 1,000 X = Exports = 600</p>
<p>Y = Imports = 0.1(Y – T)</p>
<p>Step 8. Calculate the equilibrium for this economy (remember Y = AE).</p>
<p>Y = 200 + 0.9(Y – 0.3Y) + 600 + 1000 + 600 – 0.1(Y – 0.3Y) Y – 0.63Y +
0.07Y = 2400</p>
<p>0.44Y = 2400</p>
<p>Y = 5454</p>
<p>Step 9. Assume that the full employment level of output is 6,000. What
level of government spending would be necessary to reach that level? To
answer this question, plug in 6,000 as equal to Y, but leave G as a
variable, and solve for G. Thus:</p>
<p>6000 = 200 + 0.9(6000 – 0.3(6000)) + 600 + G + 600 – 0.1(6000 –
0.3(6000))</p>
<p>Step 10. Solve this problem arithmetically. The answer is: G = 1,240. In
other words, increasing government spending by 240, from its original
level of 1,000, to 1,240, would raise output to the full employment
level of GDP.</p>
<p>Indeed, the question of how much to increase government spending so that
equilibrium output will rise from 5,454 to 6,000 can be answered without
working through the algebra, just by using the multiplier formula. The
multiplier equation in this case is:</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>1 – 0.56</p>
<p>= 2.27</p>
<p>Thus, to raise output by 546 would require an increase in government
spending of 546/2.27=240, which is the same as the answer derived from
the algebraic calculation.</p>
<p>This algebraic framework is highly flexible. For example, taxes can be
treated as a total set by political considerations (like government
spending) and not dependent on national income. Imports might be based
on before-tax income, not after-tax income. For certain purposes, it may
be helpful to analyze the economy without exports and imports. A more
complicated approach could divide up consumption, investment,
government, exports and imports into smaller categories, or to build in
some variability in the rates of taxes, savings, and imports. A wise
economist will shape the model</p>

The first column is real GDP or national income, which is what appears on the horizontal axis of the income-expenditure diagram. The second column calculates after-tax income, based on the assumption, in this case, that 30% of real GDP is collected in taxes. The third column is based on an MPC of 0.8, so that as after-tax income rises by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(700 from one row to the next, consumption rises by \)</span>560 (700 × 0.8) from one row to the next.

<p>Table B3 National Income-Aggregate Expenditure Equilibrium</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1812">The aggregate expenditure function is formed by
stacking on top of each other the consumption function (after taxes),
the investment function, the government spending function, the export
function, and the import function. The point at which the aggregate
expenditure function intersects the vertical axis will be determined by
the levels of investment, government, and export expenditures—which do
not vary with national income. The upward slope of the aggregate
expenditure function will be determined by the marginal propensity to
save, the tax rate, and the marginal propensity to import. A higher
marginal propensity to save, a higher tax rate, and a higher marginal
propensity to import will all make the slope of the aggregate
expenditure function flatter—because out of any extra income, more is
going to savings or taxes or imports and less to spending on domestic
goods and services.</span></p>
<p>The equilibrium occurs where national income is equal to aggregate
expenditure, which is shown on the graph as the point where the
aggregate expenditure schedule crosses the 45-degree line. In this
example, the equilibrium occurs at 6,000. This equilibrium can also be
read off the table under the figure; it is the level of national income
where aggregate expenditure is equal to national income.</p>

<h3><span id="bookmark1781">Equilibrium in the Keynesian Cross Model</span><a class="headerlink" href="#span-id-bookmark1781-equilibrium-in-the-keynesian-cross-model-span" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>With the aggregate expenditure line in place, the next step is to relate
it to the two other elements of the Keynesian cross diagram. Thus, the
first subsection interprets the intersection of the aggregate
expenditure function and the 45-degree line, while the next subsection
relates this point of intersection to the potential GDP line.</p>
<p>Where Equilibrium Occurs</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1810" class="s34">The point where the aggregate expenditure line that is constructed from C + I + G + X – M crosses the 45-degree line will be the equilibrium for the economy. It is the only point on the aggregate expenditure line where the total amount being spent on aggregate demand equals the total level of production. In</a>
<a href="#bookmark1810" class="a">Figure</a> B7<span class="p">, this
point of equilibrium (E</span><span
class="s60">0</span><a href="#bookmark1811" class="s34">) happens at 6,000, which can also be read off</a>
<a href="#bookmark1811" class="a">Table</a> B3<span class="p">.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1814" id="bookmark1813" class="s34">The meaning of “equilibrium” remains the same; that is, equilibrium is a point of balance where no incentive exists to shift away from that outcome. To understand why the point of intersection between the aggregate expenditure function and the 45-degree line is a macroeconomic equilibrium, consider what would happen if an economy found itself to the right of the equilibrium point E, say point H in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1814" class="a">Figure</a> B8<span class="p">, where
output is higher than the equilibrium. At point H, the level of
aggregate expenditure is below the 45-degree line, so that the level of
aggregate expenditure in the economy is less than the level of output.
As a result, at point H, output is piling up unsold—not a sustainable
state of affairs.</span></p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_456.jpg" width="301" height="243" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark1814">Figure B8 Equilibrium in the Keynesian Cross
Diagram</span> <span class="s37">If output was above the equilibrium
level, at H, then the real output is greater than the aggregate
expenditure in the economy. This pattern cannot hold, because it would
mean that goods are produced but piling up unsold. If output was below
the equilibrium level at L, then aggregate expenditure would be greater
than output. This pattern cannot hold either, because it would mean that
spending exceeds the number of goods being produced. Only point E can be
at equilibrium, where output, or national income and aggregate
expenditure, are equal. The equilibrium (E) must lie on the 45-degree
line, which is the set of points where national income and aggregate
expenditure are equal.</span></p>
<p>Conversely, consider the situation where the level of output is at point
L—where real output is lower than the equilibrium. In that case, the
level of aggregate demand in the economy is above the 45-degree line,
indicating that the level of aggregate expenditure in the economy is
greater than the level of output. When the level of aggregate demand has
emptied the store shelves, it cannot be sustained, either. Firms will
respond by increasing their level of production. Thus, the equilibrium
must be the point where the amount produced and the amount spent are in
balance, at the intersection of the aggregate expenditure function and
the 45-degree line.</p>
<p>Finding Equilibrium</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1815" class="a">Table B4</a>

<p>Table B4</p>
<p>Step 1. Calculate the amount of taxes for each level of national
income(reminder: GDP = national income) for each level of national
income using the following as an example:</p>
<p>National Income (Y) <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(300 Taxes = 0.2 or 20% × 0.2 Tax amount (T) \)</span>60</p>
<p>Step 2. Calculate after-tax income by subtracting the tax amount from
national income for each level of national income using the following as
an example:</p>
<p>National income minus taxes $300</p>
<p>–$60</p>
<p>After-tax income $240</p>
<p>Step 3. Calculate consumption. The marginal propensity to save is given
as 0.1. This means that the marginal propensity to consume is 0.9, since
MPS + MPC = 1. Therefore, multiply 0.9 by the after-tax income amount
using the following as an example:</p>
<p>After-tax Income $240 MPC × 0.9</p>
<p>Consumption $216</p>
<p>Step 4. Consider why the table shows consumption of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(236 in the first
row. As mentioned earlier, the Keynesian model assumes that there is
some level of consumption even without income. That amount is \)</span>236 –
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(216 = \)</span>20.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_457.png" width="624" height="891" alt="image" />
<p>Step 5. There is now enough information to write the consumption
function. The consumption function is found by figuring out the level of
consumption that will happen when income is zero. Remember that:</p>
<p>C = Consumption when national income is zero + MPC (after-tax income)</p>
<p>Let C represent the consumption function, Y represent national income,
and T represent taxes.</p>
<p>C = $20 + 0.9(Y – T)</p>
<p>= <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(20 + 0.9(\)</span>300 – $60)</p>
<p>= $236</p>
<p>Step 6. Use the consumption function to find consumption at each level
of national income.</p>
<p>Step 7. Add investment (I), government spending (G), and exports (X).
Remember that these do not change as national income changes:</p>
<p>Step 8. Find imports, which are 0.2 of after-tax income at each level of
national income. For example:</p>
<p>After-tax income <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(240 Imports of 0.2 or 20% of Y – T × 0.2 Imports \)</span>48</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1816" class="s48">Step 9. Find aggregate expenditure by adding C + I + G + X – I for each level of national income. Your completed table should look like</a>

<p>Step 13. Answer this question: How do expenditures and output compare at
this point? Aggregate expenditures cannot exceed output (GDP) in the
long run, since there would not be enough goods to be bought.</p>
<p>Recessionary and Inflationary Gaps</p>
<p>In the Keynesian cross diagram, if the aggregate expenditure line
intersects the 45-degree line at the level of potential GDP, then the
economy is in sound shape. There is no recession, and unemployment is
low. But there is no guarantee that the equilibrium will occur at the
potential GDP level of output. The equilibrium might be higher or lower.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1818" id="bookmark1817" class="s34">For example,</a>
<a href="#bookmark1818" class="a">Figure B9</a><span class="s54">
</span>(a) illustrates a situation where the aggregate expenditure line
intersects the 45-degree line at point E<span class="s60">0</span>,
which is a real GDP of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(6,000, and which is below the potential GDP of
\)</span>7,000. In this situation, the level of aggregate expenditure is too low
for GDP to reach its full employment level, and unemployment will occur.
The distance between an output level like E<span class="s60">0</span>
that is below potential GDP and the level of potential GDP is called a
recessionary gap. Because the equilibrium level of real GDP is so low,
firms will not wish to hire the full employment number of workers, and
unemployment will be high.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_460.jpg" width="557" height="279" alt="image" />
<p><span id="bookmark1818"><span class="s36">Figure B9 Addressing
Recessionary and Inflationary Gaps </span></span>(a) If the equilibrium
occurs at an output below potential GDP, then a recessionary gap exists.
The policy solution to a recessionary gap is to shift the aggregate
expenditure schedule up from AE<span class="s63">0</span> to AE<span
class="s63">1</span>, using policies like tax cuts or government
spending increases. Then the new equilibrium E<span class="s63">1</span>
occurs at potential GDP. (b) If the equilibrium occurs at an output
above potential GDP, then an inflationary gap exists. The policy
solution to an inflationary gap is to shift the aggregate expenditure
schedule down from AE<span class="s63">0</span> to AE<span
class="s63">1</span>, using policies like tax increases or spending
cuts. Then, the new equilibrium E<span class="s63">1</span> occurs at
potential GDP.</p>
<p>What might cause a recessionary gap? Anything that shifts the aggregate
expenditure line down is a potential cause of recession, including a
decline in consumption, a rise in savings, a fall in investment, a drop
in government spending or a rise in taxes, or a fall in exports or a
rise in imports. Moreover, an economy that is at equilibrium with a
recessionary</p>
<p>gap may just stay there and suffer high unemployment for a long time;
remember, the meaning of equilibrium is that there is no particular
adjustment of prices or quantities in the economy to chase the recession
away.</p>
<p>The appropriate response to a recessionary gap is for the government to
reduce taxes or increase spending so that the aggregate expenditure
function shifts up from AE<span class="s60">0</span> to AE<span
class="s60">1</span>. When this shift occurs, the new equilibrium E<span
class="s60">1</span>
<a href="#bookmark1818" class="s34">now occurs at potential GDP as shown in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1818" class="a">Figure B9</a><span class="s54">
</span>(a).</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1818" id="bookmark1819" class="s34">Conversely,</a>
<a href="#bookmark1818" class="a">Figure</a> <span class="s54">B9
</span>(b) shows a situation where the aggregate expenditure schedule
(AE<span class="s60">0</span>) intersects the 45-degree line above
potential GDP. The gap between the level of real GDP at the equilibrium
E<span class="s60">0</span> and potential GDP is called an inflationary
gap. The inflationary gap also requires a bit of interpreting. After
all, a naïve reading of the Keynesian cross diagram might suggest that
if the aggregate expenditure function is just pushed up high enough,
real GDP can be as large as desired—even doubling or tripling the
potential GDP level of the economy. This implication is clearly wrong.
An economy faces some supply-side limits on how much it can produce at a
given time with its existing quantities of workers, physical and human
capital, technology, and market institutions.</p>
<p>The inflationary gap should be interpreted, not as a literal prediction
of how large real GDP will be, but as a statement of how much extra
aggregate expenditure is in the economy beyond what is needed to reach
potential GDP. An inflationary gap suggests that because the economy
cannot produce enough goods and services to absorb this level of
aggregate expenditures, the spending will instead cause an inflationary
increase in the price level. In this way, even though changes in the
price level do not appear explicitly in the Keynesian cross equation,
the notion of inflation is implicit in the concept of the inflationary
gap.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1818" class="s34">The appropriate Keynesian response to an inflationary gap is shown in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1818" class="a">Figure B9</a><span class="s54">
</span>(b). The original intersection of aggregate expenditure line
AE<span class="s60">0</span> and the 45-degree line occurs at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(8,000,
which is above the level of potential GDP at \)</span>7,000. If AE<span
class="s60">0</span> shifts down to AE<span class="s60">1</span>, so
that the new equilibrium is at E<span class="s60">1</span>, then the
economy will be at potential GDP without pressures for inflationary
price increases. The government can achieve a downward shift in
aggregate expenditure by increasing taxes on consumers or firms, or by
reducing government expenditures.</p>

<h3><span id="bookmark1782">The Multiplier Effect</span><a class="headerlink" href="#span-id-bookmark1782-the-multiplier-effect-span" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Keynesian policy prescription has one final twist. Assume that for a
certain economy, the intersection of the aggregate expenditure function
and the 45-degree line is at a GDP of 700, while the level of potential
GDP for this economy is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(800. By how much does government spending need
to be increased so that the economy reaches the full employment GDP? The
obvious answer might seem to be \)</span>800 – <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(700 = \)</span>100; so raise government
spending by</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1820"><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(100. But that answer is incorrect. A change of,
for example, \)</span>100 in government expenditures will have an effect of more
than $100 on the equilibrium level of real GDP. The reason is that a
change in aggregate expenditures circles through the economy: households
buy from firms, firms pay workers and suppliers, workers and suppliers
buy goods from other firms, those firms pay their workers and suppliers,
and so on. In this way, the original change in aggregate expenditures is
actually spent more than once. This is called the multiplier effect: An
initial increase in spending, cycles repeatedly through the economy and
has a larger impact than the initial dollar amount spent.</span></p>
<p>How Does the Multiplier Work?</p>
<p>To understand how the multiplier effect works, return to the example in
which the current equilibrium in the Keynesian cross diagram is a real
GDP of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(700, or \)</span>100 short of the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(800 needed to be at full employment,
potential GDP. If the government spends \)</span>100 to close this gap, someone
in the economy receives that spending and can treat it as income. Assume
that those who receive this income pay 30% in taxes, save 10% of
after-tax income, spend 10% of total income on imports, and then spend
the rest on domestically produced goods and services.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1821" class="s34">As shown in the calculations in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1821" class="a">Figure B10</a>
<a href="#bookmark1822" class="s34">and</a> Table
B6<a href="#bookmark1821" class="s34">, out of the original <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(100 in government spending, \)</span>53 is left to spend on domestically produced goods and services. That <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(53 which was spent, becomes income to someone, somewhere in the economy. Those who receive that income also pay 30% in taxes, save 10% of after-tax income, and spend 10% of total income on imports, as shown in&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;#bookmark1821&quot; class=&quot;a&quot;&gt;Figure&lt;/a&gt; B10&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;, so
that an additional \)</span>28.09 (that is, 0.53 × <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(53) is spent in the third
round. The people who receive that income then pay taxes, save, and buy
imports, and the amount spent in the fourth round is \)</span>14.89 (that is,
0.53 × $28.09).</span></p>

<p>Table B6 Calculating the Multiplier Effect</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1821" class="s34">Thus, over the first four rounds of aggregate expenditures, the impact of the original increase in government spending of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(100 creates a rise in aggregate expenditures of \)</span>100 + <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(53 + \)</span>28.09 + <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(14.89 = \)</span>195.98.</a>
<a href="#bookmark1821" class="a">Figure B10</a> <span class="p">shows
these total aggregate expenditures after these first four rounds, and
then the figure shows the total aggregate expenditures after 30 rounds.
The additional boost to aggregate expenditures is shrinking in each
round of consumption. After about 10 rounds, the additional increments
are very small indeed—nearly invisible to the naked eye. After 30
rounds, the additional increments in each round are so small that they
have no practical consequence. After 30 rounds, the cumulative value of
the initial boost in aggregate expenditure is approximately <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(213. Thus,
the government spending increase of \)</span>100 eventually, after many cycles,
produced an increase of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(213 in aggregate expenditure and real GDP. In
this example, the multiplier is \)</span>213/$100 = 2.13.</span></p>
<p>Calculating the Multiplier</p>
<p>Fortunately for everyone who is not carrying around a computer with a
spreadsheet program to project the impact of an original increase in
expenditures over 20, 50, or 100 rounds of spending, there is a formula
for calculating the multiplier.</p>
<p>Spending Multiplier = 1/(1 – MPC * (1 – tax rate) + MPI)</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1821" class="s34">The data from</a>

<li><p>Tax rate = 10%</p></li>
<li><p>Marginal Propensity to Import (MPI) = 10%</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The MPC is equal to 1 – MPS, or 0.7. Therefore, the spending multiplier
is:</p>
<p>Spending Multiplier =</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>1 – (0.7 – (0.10)(0.7) – 0.10)</p>

<p>= 2.13</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1821" class="s34">A change in spending of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(100 multiplied by the spending multiplier of 2.13 is equal to a change in GDP of \)</span>213. Not coincidentally, this result is exactly what was calculated in</a>
<a href="#bookmark1821" class="a">Figure B10</a> <span class="p">after
many rounds of expenditures cycling through the economy.</span></p>
<p>The size of the multiplier is determined by what proportion of the
marginal dollar of income goes into taxes, saving, and imports. These
three factors are known as “leakages,” because they determine how much
demand “leaks out” in each round of the multiplier effect. If the
leakages are relatively small, then each successive round of the
multiplier effect will have larger amounts of demand, and the multiplier
will be high. Conversely, if the leakages are relatively large, then any
initial change in demand will diminish more quickly in the second,
third, and later rounds, and the multiplier will be small. Changes in
the size of the leakages—a change in the marginal propensity to save,
the tax rate, or the marginal propensity to import—will change the size
of the multiplier.</p>

<p><span id="bookmark1823"><span class="s36">Figure B11 The Multiplier
Effect in an Expenditure-Output Model </span></span>The power of the
multiplier effect is that an increase in expenditure has a larger
increase on the equilibrium output. The increase in expenditure is the
vertical increase from AE<span class="s63">0</span> to AE<span
class="s63">1</span>. However, the increase in equilibrium output, shown
on the horizontal axis, is clearly larger.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1823" class="s34">The multiplier effect is also visible on the Keynesian cross diagram.</a>
<a href="#bookmark1823" class="a">Figure B11</a><span class="s54">
</span>shows the example we have been discussing: a recessionary gap
with an equilibrium of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(700, potential GDP of \)</span>800, the slope of the
aggregate expenditure function (AE<span class="s60">0</span>) determined
by the assumptions that taxes are 30% of income, savings are 0.1 of
after-tax income, and imports are 0.1 of before-tax income. At AE<span
class="s60">1</span>, the aggregate expenditure function is moved up to
reach potential GDP.</p>
<p><a href="#bookmark1818" class="s34">Now, compare the vertical shift upward in the aggregate expenditure function, which is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(47, with the horizontal shift outward in real GDP, which is \)</span>100 (as these numbers were calculated earlier). The rise in real GDP is more than double the rise in the aggregate expenditure function. (Similarly, if you look back at</a>
<a href="#bookmark1818" class="a">Figure</a> B9<span class="p">, you
will see that the vertical movements in the aggregate expenditure
functions are smaller than the change in equilibrium output that is
produced on the horizontal axis. Again, this is the multiplier effect at
work.) In this way, the power of the multiplier is apparent in the
income–expenditure graph, as well as in the arithmetic
calculation.</span></p>

<p>The multiplier does not just affect government spending, but applies to
any change in the economy. Say that business confidence declines and
investment falls off, or that the economy of a leading trading partner
slows down so that export sales decline. These changes will reduce
aggregate expenditures, and then will have an even larger effect on real
GDP because of the multiplier effect. Read the following Clear It Up
feature to learn how the multiplier effect can be applied to analyze the
economic impact of professional sports.</p>
<p>How can the multiplier be used to analyze the economic impact of
professional sports?</p>
<p>Attracting professional sports teams and building sports stadiums to
create jobs and stimulate business growth is an economic development
strategy adopted by many communities throughout the United States. In
his recent article, “Public Financing of Private Sports Stadiums,” James
Joyner of <em>Outside the Beltway</em> looked at public financing for NFL
teams. Joyner’s findings confirm the earlier work of John Siegfried of
Vanderbilt University and Andrew Zimbalist of Smith College.</p>
<p>Siegfried and Zimbalist used the multiplier to analyze this issue. They
considered the amount of taxes paid and dollars spent locally to see if
there was a positive multiplier effect. Since most professional athletes
and owners of sports teams are rich enough to owe a lot of taxes, let’s
say that 40% of any marginal income they earn is paid in taxes. Because
athletes are often high earners with short careers, let’s assume that
they save one-third of their after-tax income.</p>
<p>However, many professional athletes do not live year-round in the city
in which they play, so let’s say that one-half of the money that they do
spend is spent outside the local area. One can think of spending outside
a local economy, in this example, as the equivalent of imported goods
for the national economy.</p>
<p>Now, consider the impact of money spent at local entertainment venues
other than professional sports. While the owners of these other
businesses may be comfortably middle-income, few of them are in the
economic stratosphere of professional athletes. Because their incomes
are lower, so are their taxes; say that they pay only 35% of their
marginal income in taxes. They do not have the same ability, or need, to
save as much as professional athletes, so let’s assume their MPC is just
0.8. Finally, because more of them live locally, they will spend a
higher proportion of their income on local goods—say, 65%.</p>
<p>If these general assumptions hold true, then money spent on professional
sports will have less local economic impact than money spent on other
forms of entertainment. For professional athletes, out of a dollar
earned, 40 cents goes to taxes, leaving 60 cents. Of that 60 cents,
one-third is saved, leaving 40 cents, and half is spent outside the
area, leaving 20 cents. Only 20 cents of each dollar is cycled into the
local economy in the first round. For locally-owned entertainment, out
of a dollar earned, 35 cents goes to taxes, leaving 65 cents. Of the
rest, 20% is saved, leaving 52 cents, and of that amount, 65% is spent
in the local area, so that 33.8 cents of each dollar of income is
recycled into the local economy.</p>
<p>Siegfried and Zimbalist make the plausible argument that, within their
household budgets, people have a fixed amount to spend on entertainment.
If this assumption holds true, then money spent attending professional
sports events is money that was not spent on other entertainment options
in a given metropolitan area. Since the multiplier is lower for
professional sports than for other local entertainment options, the
arrival of professional sports to a city would reallocate entertainment</p>
<p>spending in a way that causes the local economy to shrink, rather than
to grow. Thus, their findings seem to confirm what Joyner reports and
what newspapers across the country are reporting. A quick Internet
search for “economic impact of sports” will yield numerous reports
questioning this economic development strategy.</p>
<p>Multiplier Tradeoffs: Stability versus the Power of Macroeconomic Policy</p>
<p>Is an economy healthier with a high multiplier or a low one? With a high
multiplier, any change in aggregate demand will tend to be substantially
magnified, and so the economy will be more unstable. With a low
multiplier, by contrast, changes in aggregate demand will not be
multiplied much, so the economy will tend to be more stable.</p>
<p>However, with a low multiplier, government policy changes in taxes or
spending will tend to have less impact on the equilibrium level of real
output. With a higher multiplier, government policies to raise or reduce
aggregate expenditures will have a larger effect. Thus, a low multiplier
means a more stable economy, but also weaker government macroeconomic
policy, while a high multiplier means a more volatile economy, but also
an economy in which government macroeconomic policy is more powerful.</p>

<h3><span id="bookmark1783">Key Concepts and Summary</span><a class="headerlink" href="#span-id-bookmark1783-key-concepts-and-summary-span" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The expenditure-output model or Keynesian cross diagram shows how the
level of aggregate expenditure (on the vertical axis) varies with the
level of economic output (shown on the horizontal axis). Since the value
of all macroeconomic output also represents income to someone somewhere
else in the economy, the horizontal axis can also be interpreted as
national income. The equilibrium in the diagram will occur where the
aggregate expenditure line crosses the 45-degree line, which represents
the set of points where aggregate expenditure in the economy is equal to
output (or national income). Equilibrium in a Keynesian cross diagram
can happen at potential GDP, or below or above that level.</p>
<p>The consumption function shows the upward-sloping relationship between
national income and consumption. The marginal propensity to consume
(MPC) is the amount consumed out of an additional dollar of income. A
higher marginal propensity to consume means a steeper consumption
function; a lower marginal propensity to consume means a flatter
consumption function. The marginal propensity to save (MPS) is the
amount saved out of an additional dollar of income. It is necessarily
true that MPC + MPS = 1. The investment function is drawn as a flat
line, showing that investment in the current year does not change with
regard to the current level of national income. However, the investment
function will move up and down based on the expected rate of return in
the future. Government spending is drawn as a horizontal line in the
Keynesian cross diagram, because its level is determined by political
considerations, not by the current level of income in the economy. Taxes
in the basic Keynesian cross diagram are taken into account by adjusting
the consumption function. The export function is drawn as a horizontal
line in the Keynesian cross diagram, because exports do not change as a
result of changes in domestic income, but they move as a result of
changes in foreign income, as well as changes in exchange rates. The
import function is drawn as a downward-sloping line, because imports
rise with national income, but imports are a subtraction from aggregate
demand. Thus, a higher level of imports means a lower level of
expenditure on domestic goods.</p>
<p>In a Keynesian cross diagram, the equilibrium may be at a level below
potential GDP, which is called a recessionary gap, or at a level above
potential GDP, which is called an inflationary gap.</p>
<p>The multiplier effect describes how an initial change in aggregate
demand generated several times as much as cumulative GDP. The size of
the spending multiplier is determined by three leakages: spending on
savings, taxes, and imports. The formula for the multiplier is:</p>
<p>Multiplier =</p>
<p>1                          <span class="s16">
1 – (MPC × (1 – tax rate) + MPI)</span></p>
<p>An economy with a lower multiplier is more stable—it is less affected
either by economic events or by government policy than an economy with a
higher multiplier.</p>

<p>Figure B13</p>
<p>Exercise B3</p>
<p>An economy has the following characteristics: Y = National income</p>
<p>Taxes = T = 0.25Y</p>
<p>C = Consumption = 400 + 0.85(Y – T) I = 300</p>
<p>G = 200</p>
<p>X = 500</p>
<p>M = 0.1(Y – T)</p>
<p>Find the equilibrium for this economy. If potential GDP is 3,500, then
what change in government spending is needed to achieve this level? Do
this problem two ways. First, plug 3,500 into the equations and solve
for G. Second, calculate the multiplier and figure it out that way.</p>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>First, set up the calculation.</p>
<p>AE = 400 + 0.85(Y – T) + 300 + 200 + 500 – 0.1(Y – T) AE = Y</p>
<p>Then insert Y for AE and 0.25Y for T.</p>
<p>Y = 400 + 0.85(Y – 0.25Y) + 300 + 200 + 500 – 0.1(Y – 0.25Y) Y = 1400 +
0.6375Y – 0.075Y</p>
<p>0.4375Y = 1400</p>
<p>Y = 3200</p>
<p>If full employment is 3,500, then one approach is to plug in 3,500 for Y
throughout the equation, but to leave G as a separate variable.</p>
<p>Y = 400 + 0.85(Y – 0.25Y) + 300 + G + 500 + 0.1(Y – 0.25Y)</p>
<p>3500 = 400 + 0.85(3500 – 0.25(3500)) + 300 + G + 500 – 0.1(3500 –
0.25(3500))</p>
<p>G = 3500 – 400 – 2231.25 – 1300 – 500 + 262.5</p>
<p>G = 331.25</p>
<p>A G value of 331.25 is an increase of 131.25 from its original level of
200.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the multiplier is that, out of every dollar spent, 0.25
goes to taxes, leaving 0.75, and out of after-tax income, 0.15 goes to
savings and 0.1 to imports. Because (0.75)(0.15) = 0.1125 and
(0.75)(0.1) = 0.075, this means</p>
<p>that out of every dollar spent: 1 –0.25 –0.1125 –0.075 = 0.5625. Thus,
using the formula, the multiplier is:</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>1 – 0.5625</p>
<p>= 2.2837</p>
<p>To increase equilibrium GDP by 300, it will take a boost of 300/2.2837,
which again works out to 131.25.</p>

<p>Exercise B5</p>
<p>Explain how the multiplier works. Use an MPC of 80% in an example.</p>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>The multiplier refers to how many times a dollar will turnover in the
economy. It is based on the Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC) which
tells how much of every dollar received will be spent. If the MPC is 80%
then this means that out of every one dollar received by a consumer,
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0.80 will be spent. This \)</span>0.80 is received by another person. In turn,
80% of the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0.80 received, or \)</span>0.64, will be spent, and so on. The
impact of the multiplier is diluted when the effect of taxes and
expenditure on imports is considered. To derive the multiplier, take the
1/1 – F; where F is equal to percent of savings, taxes, and expenditures
on imports.</p>

<li><p>Scarcity means human wants for goods and services exceed the
available supply. Supply is limited because resources are limited.
Demand, however, is virtually unlimited. Whatever the supply, it
seems human nature to want more.</p></li>
<li><p>100 people / 10 people per ham = a maximum of 10 hams per month if
all residents produce ham. Since consumption is limited by
production, the maximum number of hams residents could consume per
month is 10.</p></li>
<li><p>She is very productive at her consulting job, but not very
productive growing vegetables. Time spent consulting would produce
far more income than it what she could save growing her vegetables
using the same amount of time. So on purely economic grounds, it
makes more sense for her to maximize her income by applying her
labor to what she does best (i.e. specialization of labor).</p></li>
<li><p>The engineer is better at computer science than at painting. Thus,
his time is better spent working for pay at his job and paying a
painter to paint his house. Of course, this assumes he does not
paint his house for fun!</p></li>
<li><p>There are many physical systems that would work, for example, the
study of planets (micro) in the solar system (macro), or solar
systems (micro) in the galaxy (macro).</p></li>
<li><p>Draw a box outside the original circular flow to represent the
foreign country. Draw an arrow from the foreign country to firms, to
represents imports. Draw an arrow in the reverse direction
representing payments for imports. Draw an arrow from firms to the
foreign country to represent exports. Draw an arrow in the reverse
direction to represent payments for imports.</p></li>
<li><p>There are many such problems. Consider the AIDS epidemic. Why are so
few AIDS patients in Africa and Southeast Asia treated with the same
drugs that are effective in the United States and Europe? It is
because neither those patients nor the countries in which they live
have the resources to purchase the same drugs.</p></li>
<li><p>Public enterprise means the factors of production (resources and
businesses) are owned and operated by the government.</p></li>
<li><p>The United States is a large country economically speaking, so it
has less need to trade internationally than the other countries
mentioned. (This is the same reason that France and Italy have lower
ratios than Belgium or Sweden.) One additional reason is that each
of the other countries is a member of the European Union, where
trade between members occurs without barriers to trade, like tariffs
and quotas.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><span id="bookmark1827">Chapter 2</span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>The opportunity cost of bus tickets is the number of burgers that
must be given up to obtain one more bus ticket. Originally, when the
price of bus tickets was 50 cents per trip, this opportunity cost
was 0.50/2 = .25 burgers. The reason for this is that at the
original prices, one burger (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2) costs the same as four bus tickets
(\)</span>0.50), so the opportunity cost of a burger is four bus tickets,
and the opportunity cost of a bus ticket is .25 (the inverse of the
opportunity cost of a burger). With the new, higher price of bus
tickets, the opportunity cost rises to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1/\)</span>2 or 0.50. You can see
this graphically since the slope of the new budget constraint is
steeper than the original one. If Alphonso spends all of his budget
on burgers, the higher price of bus tickets has no impact so the
vertical intercept of the budget constraint is the same. If he
spends all of his budget on bus tickets, he can now afford only half
as many, so the vertical intercept is half as much. In short, the
budget constraint rotates clockwise around the vertical intercept,

<li><p>More fuel-efficient cars means there is less need for gasoline. This

Since the demand curve is shifting down the supply curve, the

</li>
<li><p>Cold weather increases the need for heating oil. This causes a
rightward shift in the demand for heating oil and thus oil. Since

<li><p>A discovery of new oil will make oil more abundant. This can be
shown as a rightward shift in the supply curve, which will cause a

so price and quantity follow the law of demand. If price goes down,
then the quantity goes up.)</p></li>
<li><p>When an economy slows down, it produces less output and demands less

<li><p>Step 1. Draw the graph with the initial supply and demand curves.
Label the initial equilibrium price and quantity. Step 2. Did the
economic event affect supply or demand? Jet fuel is a cost of
producing air travel, so an increase in jet fuel price affects
supply. Step 3. An increase in the price of jet fuel caused a
decrease in the cost of air travel. We show this as a downward or
rightward shift in supply. Step 4. A rightward shift in supply
causes a movement down the demand curve, lowering the equilibrium
price of air travel and increasing the equilibrium quantity.</p></li>
<li><p>Step 1. Draw the graph with the initial supply and demand curves.
Label the initial equilibrium price and quantity. Step 2. Did the
economic event affect supply or demand? A tariff is treated like a
cost of production, so this affects supply. Step 3. A tariff
reduction is equivalent to a decrease in the cost of production,
which we can show as a rightward (or downward) shift in supply.
Step 4. A rightward shift in supply causes a movement down the
demand curve, lowering the equilibrium price and raising the

<li><p>A price ceiling (which is below the equilibrium price) will cause
the quantity demanded to rise and the quantity supplied to fall.
This is why a price ceiling creates a shortage.</p></li>
<li><p>A price ceiling is just a legal restriction. Equilibrium is an
economic condition. People may or may not obey the price ceiling, so
the actual price may be at or above the price ceiling, but the price
ceiling does not change the equilibrium price.</p></li>
<li><p>A price ceiling is a legal maximum price, but a price floor is a
legal minimum price and, consequently, it would leave room for the
price to rise to its equilibrium level. In other words, a price
floor below equilibrium will not be binding and will have no effect.</p></li>
<li><p>Assuming that people obey the price ceiling, the market price will
be below equilibrium, which means that Qd will be more than Qs.
Buyers can only buy what is offered for sale, so the number of
transactions will fall to Qs. This is easy to see graphically. By
analogous reasoning, with a price floor the market price will be
above the equilibrium price, so Qd will be less than Qs. Since the
limit on transactions here is demand, the number of transactions
will fall to Qd. Note that because both price floors and price
ceilings reduce the number of transactions, social surplus is less.</p></li>
<li><p>Because the losses to consumers are greater than the benefits to
producers, so the net effect is negative. Since the</p></li>

social surplus falls.</p>

<li><p>Changes in the wage rate (the price of labor) cause a movement along
the demand curve. A change in anything else that affects demand for
labor (e.g., changes in output, changes in the production process
that use more or less labor, government regulation) causes a shift
in the demand curve.</p></li>
<li><p>Changes in the wage rate (the price of labor) cause a movement along
the supply curve. A change in anything else that affects supply of
labor (e.g., changes in how desirable the job is perceived to be,
government policy to promote training in the field) causes a shift
in the supply curve.</p></li>
<li><p>Since a living wage is a suggested minimum wage, it acts like a
price floor (assuming, of course, that it is followed). If the
living wage is binding, it will cause an excess supply of labor at
that wage rate.</p></li>
<li><p>Changes in the interest rate (i.e., the price of financial capital)
cause a movement along the demand curve. A change in anything else
(non-price variable) that affects demand for financial capital

borrowing) would shift the demand curve.</p></li>

cause a movement along the supply curve. A change in anything else
that affects the supply of financial capital (a non-price variable)

<li><p>If market interest rates stay in their normal range, an interest
rate limit of 35% would not be binding. If the equilibrium interest
rate rose above 35%, the interest rate would be capped at that rate,
and the quantity of loans would be lower than the equilibrium
quantity, causing a shortage of loans.</p></li>
<li><p>b and c will lead to a fall in interest rates. At a lower demand,
lenders will not be able to charge as much, and with more available
lenders, competition for borrowers will drive rates down.</p></li>
<li><p>a and c will increase the quantity of loans. More people who want to
borrow will result in more loans being given, as will more people
who want to lend.</p></li>
<li><p>A price floor prevents a price from falling below a certain level,
but has no effect on prices above that level. It will have its
biggest effect in creating excess supply (as measured by the entire

substantially above the equilibrium price. This is illustrated in
the following figure.</p>

this to happen, societies must create a legal environment that gives
individuals the ability to use their property to their fullest and
highest use, including the right to trade or sell that property.
Without a legal system that enforces contracts, people would not be
likely to enter into contracts for current or future services
because of the risk of non-payment. This would make it difficult to
transact business and would slow economic growth.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes. Since productivity is output per unit of input, we can measure
productivity using GDP (output) per worker (input).</p></li>

<li><p>Capital deepening and technology are important. What seems to be
more important is how they are combined.</p></li>
<li><p>Government can contribute to economic growth by investing in human
capital through the education system, building a strong physical
infrastructure for transportation and commerce, increasing
investment by lowering capital gains taxes, creating special
economic zones that allow for reduced tariffs, and investing in
research and development.</p></li>
<li><p>Public education, low investment taxes, funding for infrastructure
projects, special economic zones</p></li>
<li><p>A good way to think about this is how a runner who has fallen behind
in a race feels psychologically and physically as he catches up.
Playing catch-up can be more taxing than maintaining one’s position
at the head of the pack.</p>

<li><p>No. Capital deepening refers to an increase in the amount of
capital per person in an economy. A decrease in investment by
firms will actually cause the opposite of capital deepening
(since the population will grow over time).</p></li>
<li><p>There is no direct connection between an increase in
international trade and capital deepening. One could imagine
particular scenarios where trade could lead to capital deepening
(for example, if international capital</p>
<p>inflows—which are the counterpart to increasing the trade
deficit—lead to an increase in physical capital investment), but
in general, no.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Yes. Capital deepening refers to an increase in either physical
capital or human capital per person. Continuing education or any
time of lifelong learning adds to human capital and thus creates
capital deepening.</p></li>

<li><p>The advantages of backwardness include faster growth rates because
of the process of convergence, as well as the ability to adopt new
technologies that were developed first in the “leader” countries.
While being “backward” is not inherently a good thing, Gerschenkron
stressed that there are certain advantages which aid countries
trying to “catch up.”</p></li>
<li><p>Capital deepening, by definition, should lead to diminished returns
because you’re investing more and more but using the same methods of
production, leading to the marginal productivity declining. This is
shown on a production function as a movement along the curve.
Improvements in technology should not lead to diminished returns
because you are finding new and more efficient ways of using the
same amount of capital. This can be illustrated as a shift upward of
the production function curve.</p></li>
<li><p>Productivity growth from new advances in technology will not slow
because the new methods of production will be adopted relatively
quickly and easily, at very low marginal cost. Also, countries that
are seeing technology growth usually have a vast and powerful set of
institutions for training workers and building better machines,
which allows the maximum amount of people to benefit from the new
technology. These factors have the added effect of making additional
technological advances even easier for these countries.</p></li>

<li><p>The population is divided into those “in the labor force” and those
“not in the labor force.” Thus, the number of adults not in the
labor force is 237.8 – 153.9 = 83.9 million. Since the labor force
is divided into employed persons and unemployed persons, the number
of unemployed persons is 153.9 – 139.1 = 14.8 million. Thus, the
adult population has the following proportions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>139.1/237.8 = 58.5% employed persons</p></li>
<li><p>14.8/237.8 = 6.2% unemployed persons</p></li>
<li><p>83.9/237.8 = 35.3% persons out of the labor force</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The unemployment rate is defined as the number of unemployed persons
as a percentage of the labor force or 14.8/</p>
<p>153.9 = 9.6%. This is higher than the February 2015 unemployment
rate, computed earlier, of 5.5%.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Over the long term, the U.S. unemployment rate has remained
basically the same level.</p></li>

<li><p>Because of the influx of women into the labor market, the supply of
labor shifts to the right. Since wages are sticky downward, the
increased supply of labor causes an increase in people looking for
jobs (Qs), but no change in the number of jobs available (Qe). As a
result, unemployment increases by the amount of the increase in the
labor supply. This can be seen in the following figure. Over time,
as labor demand grows, the unemployment will decline and eventually
wages will begin to increase again. But this increase in labor
demand goes beyond the scope of this problem.</p>

<li><p>The increase in labor supply was a social demographic trend—it was
not caused by the economy falling into a recession. Therefore, the
influx of women into the work force increased the natural rate of
unemployment.</p></li>

are counted as frictionally unemployed until they find a job.</p></li>

<p>The rise in cost of living is calculated as the percentage increase:
(2244 – 2120) / 2120 = 0.0585 = 5.85%.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Since the CPI measures the prices of the goods and services
purchased by the typical urban consumer, it measures the prices of
things that people buy with their paycheck. For that reason, the CPI
would be the best price index to use for this purpose.</p></li>
<li><p>The PPI is subject to those biases for essentially the same reasons
as the CPI is. The GDP deflator picks up prices of what is actually
purchased that year, so there are no biases. That is the advantage
of using the GDP deflator over the CPI.</p></li>
<li><p>The calculator requires you to input three numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The first year, in this case the year of your birth</p></li>

purchasing power</p></li>

<li><p>In order to supply goods, suppliers must employ workers, whose
incomes increase as a result of their labor. They use this
additional income to demand goods of an equivalent value to those
they supply.</p></li>
<li><p>When consumers demand more goods than are available on the market,
prices are driven higher and the additional opportunities for profit
induce more suppliers to enter the market, producing an equivalent
amount to that which is demanded.</p></li>
<li><p>Higher input prices make output less profitable, decreasing the
desired supply. This is shown graphically as a leftward shift in the
AS curve.</p></li>
<li><p>Equilibrium occurs at the level of GDP where AD = AS. Insufficient
aggregate demand could explain why the equilibrium occurs at a level
of GDP less than potential. A decrease (or leftward shift) in
aggregate supply could be another reason.</p></li>
<li><p>Immigration reform as described should increase the labor supply,
shifting SRAS to the right, leading to a higher equilibrium GDP and
a lower price level.</p></li>
<li><p>Given the assumptions made here, the cuts in R&amp;D funding should
reduce productivity growth. The model would show this as a leftward
shift in the SRAS curve, leading to a lower equilibrium GDP and a
higher price level.</p></li>
<li><p>An increase in the value of the stock market would make individuals
feel wealthier and thus more confident about their economic
situation. This would likely cause an increase in consumer
confidence leading to an increase in consumer spending, shifting the
AD curve to the right. The result would be an increase in the
equilibrium level of GDP and an increase in the price level.</p></li>
<li><p>Since imports depend on GDP, if Mexico goes into recession, its GDP
declines and so do its imports. This decline in our exports can be
shown as a leftward shift in AD, leading to a decrease in our GDP
and price level.</p></li>
<li><p>Tax cuts increase consumer and investment spending, depending on
where the tax cuts are targeted. This would shift AD to the right,
so if the tax cuts occurred when the economy was in recession (and
GDP was less than potential), the tax cuts would increase GDP and
“lead the economy out of recession.”</p></li>
<li><p>A negative report on home prices would make consumers feel like the
value of their homes, which for most Americans is a major portion of
their wealth, has declined. A negative report on consumer confidence
would make consumers feel pessimistic about the future. Both of
these would likely reduce consumer spending, shifting AD to the
left, reducing GDP and the price level. A positive report on the
home price index or consumer confidence would do the opposite.</p></li>
<li><p>A smaller labor force would be reflected in a leftward shift in AS,
leading to a lower equilibrium level of GDP and higher price level.</p></li>
<li><p>Higher EU growth would increase demand for U.S. exports, reducing
our trade deficit. The increased demand for exports would show up as
a rightward shift in AD, causing GDP to rise (and the price level to
rise as well). Higher GDP would require more jobs to fulfill, so
U.S. employment would also rise.</p></li>
<li><p>Expansionary monetary policy shifts AD to the right. A continuing
expansionary policy would cause larger and larger shifts (given the
parameters of this problem). The result would be an increase in GDP
and employment (a decrease in unemployment) and higher prices until
potential output was reached. After that point, the expansionary
policy would simply cause inflation.</p></li>
<li><p>Since the SRAS curve is vertical in the neoclassical zone, unless
the economy is bordering the intermediate zone, a decrease in AS
will cause a decrease in the price level, but no effect on real
economic activity (for example, real GDP or employment).</p></li>

decrease in AD should depress real economic activity but have no

<li><p>An inflationary gap is the result of an increase in aggregate demand
when the economy is at potential output. Since the AS curve is
vertical at potential GDP, any increase in AD will lead to a higher
price level (i.e. inflation) but no higher real GDP. This is easy to
see if you draw AD<span class="s60">1</span> to the right of AD<span

<li><p>A decrease in government spending will shift AD to the left.</p></li>
<li><p>A decrease in energy prices, a positive supply shock, would cause
the AS curve to shift out to the right, yielding more real GDP at a
lower price level. This would shift the Phillips curve down toward
the origin, meaning the economy would experience lower unemployment
and a lower rate of inflation.</p></li>
<li><p>Keynesian economics does not require microeconomic price controls of
any sort. It is true that many Keynesian economic prescriptions were
for the government to influence the total amount of aggregate demand
in the economy, often through government spending and tax cuts.</p></li>
<li><p>The three problems center on government’s ability to estimate
potential GDP, decide whether to influence aggregate demand through
tax changes or changes in government spending, and the lag time that
occurs as Congress and the President attempt to pass legislation.</p></li>

<li><p>No, this statement is false. It would be more accurate to say that
rational expectations seek to predict the future as accurately as
possible, using all of past experience as a guide. Adaptive
expectations are largely backward looking; that is, they adapt as
experience accumulates, but without attempting to look forward.</p></li>
<li><p>An unemployment rate of zero percent is presumably well below the
rate that is consistent with potential GDP and with the natural rate
of unemployment. As a result, this policy would be attempting to
push AD out to the right. In the short run, it is possible to have
unemployment slightly below the natural rate for a time, at a price
of higher inflation, as shown by the movement from E<span
class="s60">0</span> to E<span class="s60">1</span> along the
short-run AS curve. However, over time the extremely low
unemployment rates will tend to cause wages to be bid up, and shift
the short-run AS curve back to the left. The result would be a
higher price level, but an economy still at potential GDP and the
natural rate of unemployment, as determined by the long-run AS
curve. If the government continues this policy, it will continually
be pushing the price</p>
<p>level higher and higher, but it will not be able to achieve its goal
of zero percent unemployment, because that goal is inconsistent with
market forces.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The statement is accurate. Rational expectations can be thought of
as a version of neoclassical economics because it argues that
potential GDP and the rate of unemployment are shaped by market
forces as wages and prices adjust. However, it is an “extreme”
version because it argues that this adjustment takes place very
quickly. Other theories, like adaptive expectations, suggest that
adjustment to the neoclassical outcome takes a few years.</p></li>
<li><p>The short-term Keynesian model is built on the importance of
aggregate demand as a cause of business cycles and a degree of wage
and price rigidity, and thus does a sound job of explaining many
recessions and why cyclical unemployment rises and falls. The
neoclassical model emphasizes aggregate supply by focusing on the
underlying determinants of output and employment in markets, and
thus tends to put more emphasis on economic growth and how labor
markets work.</p></li>

<li><p>The problem occurs when banks borrow foreign currency but lend in
domestic currency. Since banks’ assets (loans they made) are in
domestic currency, while their debts (money they borrowed) are in
foreign currency, when the domestic currency declines, their debts
grow larger. If the domestic currency falls substantially in value,
as happened during the Asian financial crisis, then the banking
system could fail. This problem is unlikely to occur for U.S. banks
because, even when they borrow from abroad, they tend to borrow
dollars. Remember, there are trillions of dollars in circulation in
the global economy. Since both assets and debts are in dollars, a
change in the value of the dollar does not cause banking system
failure the way it can when banks borrow in foreign currency.</p></li>
<li><p>While capital flight is possible in either case, if a country
borrows to invest in real capital it is more likely to be able to
generate the income to pay back its debts than a country that

investment-stimulated economy is less likely to provoke capital
flight and economic recession.</p></li>
<li><p>A contractionary monetary policy, by driving up domestic interest
rates, would cause the currency to appreciate. The higher value of
the currency in foreign exchange markets would reduce exports, since
from the perspective of foreign buyers, they are now more expensive.
The higher value of the currency would similarly stimulate imports,
since they would now be cheaper from the perspective of domestic
buyers. Lower exports and higher imports cause net exports (EX – IM)
to fall, which causes aggregate demand to fall. The result would be
a decrease in GDP working through the exchange rate mechanism
reinforcing the effect contractionary monetary policy has on
domestic investment expenditure. However, cheaper imports would
stimulate aggregate supply, bringing GDP back to potential, though
at a lower price level.</p></li>
<li><p>For a currency to fall, a central bank need only supply more of its
currency in foreign exchange markets. It can print as much domestic
currency as it likes. For a currency to rise, a central bank needs
to buy its currency in foreign exchange markets, paying with foreign
currency. Since no central bank has an infinite amount of foreign
currency reserves, it cannot buy its currency indefinitely.</p></li>

<li><p>Yes, a nation can run budget deficits and see its debt/GDP ratio
fall. In fact, this is not uncommon. If the deficit is small in a
given year, than the addition to debt in the numerator of the
debt/GDP ratio will be relatively small, while the growth in GDP is
larger, and so the debt/GDP ratio declines. This was the experience
of the U.S. economy for the period from the end of World War II to
about 1980. It is also theoretically possible, although not likely,
for a nation to have a budget surplus and see its debt/GDP ratio
rise. Imagine the case of a nation with a small surplus, but in a
recession year when the economy shrinks. It is possible that the
decline in the nation’s debt, in the numerator of the debt/GDP

<li><p>In a recession, because of the decline in economic output, less
income is earned, and so less in taxes is automatically collected.
Many welfare and unemployment programs are designed so that those
who fall into certain categories, like “unemployed” or “low income,”
are eligible for benefits. During a recession, more people fall into
these categories and become eligible for benefits automatically. The
combination of reduced taxes and higher spending is just what is
needed for an economy in recession producing below potential GDP.
With an economic boom, average income levels rise in the economy, so
more in taxes is automatically collected. Fewer people meet the
criteria for receiving government assistance to the unemployed or
the needy, so government spending on unemployment assistance and
welfare falls automatically. This combination of higher taxes and
lower spending is just what is needed if an economy is producing
above its potential GDP.</p></li>

<li><p>Monetary policy probably has shorter time lags than fiscal policy.
Imagine that the data becomes fairly clear that an economy is in or
near a recession. Expansionary monetary policy can be carried out
through open market operations, which can be done fairly quickly,
since the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee meets six times a
year. Also, monetary policy takes effect through interest rates,
which can change fairly quickly. However, fiscal policy is carried
out through acts of Congress that need to be signed into law by the
president. Negotiating such laws often takes months, and even after
the laws are negotiated, it takes more months for spending programs
or tax cuts to have an effect on the macroeconomy.</p></li>
<li><p>The government would have to make up the revenue either by raising
taxes in a different area or cutting spending.</p></li>
<li><p>Programs where the amount of spending is not fixed, but rather
determined by macroeconomic conditions, such as food stamps, would
lose a great deal of flexibility if spending increases had to be met

<li><p>We use the national savings and investment identity to solve this
question. In this case, the government has a budget surplus, so the
government surplus appears as part of the supply of financial
capital. Then:</p>
<p>Quantity supplied of financial capital = Quantity demanded of
financial capital</p>
<p>S + (T – G) = I + (X – M) 600 + 200 = I + 100</p>
<p>I = 700</p>
<p><span
style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Liberation Serif&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; font-size: 9pt;">2</span>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Since the government has a budget surplus, the government budget
term appears with the supply of capital. The following shows the
national savings and investment identity for this economy. <span
class="s16">Quantity supplied of financial capital = Quantity
demanded of financial capital</span></p>
<p>S + (T – G) = I + (X – M)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Plugging the given values into the identity shown in part (a),
we find that (X – M) = 0.</p></li>
<li><p>Since the government has a budget deficit, the government budget
term appears with the demand for capital. You do not know in
advance whether the economy has a trade deficit or a trade
surplus. But when you see that the quantity demanded of
financial capital exceeds the quantity supplied, you know that
there must be an additional quantity of financial capital
supplied by foreign investors, which means a trade deficit
of 2000. This example shows that in this case there is a higher
budget deficit, and a higher trade deficit. <span
class="s16">Quantity supplied of financial capital = Quantity
demanded of financial capital</span></p></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>S + (M – X) = I + (G – T) 4000 + 2000 = 5000 + 1000</p>
<ol>
<li><p>In this case, the national saving and investment identity is written
in this way:</p>
<p>Quantity supplied of financial capital = Quantity demanded of
financial capital (T – G) + (M – X) + S = I</p>
<p>The increase in the government budget surplus and the increase in
the trade deficit both increased the supply of financial capital. If
investment in physical capital remained unchanged, then private
savings must go down, and if savings remained unchanged, then
investment must go up. In fact, both effects happened; that is, in
the late 1990s, in the U.S. economy, savings declined and investment
rose.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Ricardian equivalence means that private saving changes to offset
exactly any changes in the government budget. So, if the deficit
increases by 20, private saving increases by 20 as well, and the
trade deficit and the budget deficit will not change from their
original levels. The original national saving and investment
identity is written below. Notice that if any change in the (G – T)
term is offset by a change in the S term, then the other terms do
not change. So if (G</p>
<p>– T) rises by 20, then S must also increase by 20.</p>
<p>Quantity supplied of financial capital = Quantity demanded of
financial capital</p>
<p>S + (M – X) = I + (G – T) 130 + 20 = 100 + 50</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the last few decades, spending per student has climbed
substantially. However, test scores have fallen over this time. This
experience has led a number of experts to argue that the problem is
not resources—or is not just resources by itself—but is also a
problem of how schools are organized and managed and what incentives
they have for success. There are a number of proposals to alter the
incentives that schools face, but relatively little hard evidence on
what proposals work well. Without trying to evaluate whether these
proposals are good or bad ideas, you can just list some of them:
testing students regularly; rewarding teachers or schools that
perform well on such tests; requiring additional teacher training;
allowing students to choose between public schools; allowing
teachers and parents to start new schools; giving student “vouchers”
that they can use to pay tuition at either public or private
schools.</p></li>
<li><p>The government can direct government spending to R&amp;D. It can also
create tax incentives for business to invest in R&amp;D.</p></li>

<li><p>False. Anything that leads to different levels of productivity
between two economies can be a source of comparative advantage. For
example, the education of workers, the knowledge base of engineers
and scientists in a country, the part of a split-up value chain
where they have their specialized learning, economies of scale, and
other factors can all determine comparative advantage.</p></li>

organizing the information in a table, such as in the following

<p>In this example, France has an absolute advantage in the production
of both sweaters and wine. You can tell because it takes France less
labor to produce a unit of the good.</p>

<ol class="simple">
<li><p>In Germany, it takes fewer workers to make either a television
or a video camera. Germany has an absolute advantage in the
production of both goods.</p></li>
<li><p>Producing an additional television in Germany requires three
workers. Shifting those three German workers will reduce video
camera production by 3/4 of a camera. Producing an additional
television set in Poland requires six workers, and shifting
those workers from the other good reduces output of video
cameras by 6/ 12 of a camera, or 1/2. Thus, the opportunity cost
of producing televisions is lower in Poland, so Poland has the
comparative advantage in the production of televisions. <em>Note</em>:
Do not let the fractions like 3/4 of a camera or 1/2 of a video
camera bother you. If either country was to expand television
production by a significant amount—that is, lots more than one
unit—then we will be talking about whole cameras and not
fractional ones. You can also spot this conclusion by noticing
that Poland’s absolute disadvantage is relatively lower in
televisions, because Poland needs twice as many workers to
produce a television but three times as many to produce a video
camera, so the product with the relatively lower absolute
disadvantage is Poland’s comparative advantage.</p></li>
<li><p>Producing a video camera in Germany requires four workers, and
shifting those four workers away from television production has
an opportunity cost of 4/3 television sets. Producing a video
camera in Poland requires 12 workers, and shifting those 12
workers away from television production has an opportunity cost
of two television sets. Thus, the opportunity cost of producing
video cameras is lower in Germany, and video cameras will be
Germany’s comparative advantage.</p></li>
<li><p>In this example, absolute advantage differs from comparative
advantage. Germany has the absolute advantage in the production
of both goods, but Poland has a comparative advantage in the
production of televisions.</p></li>
<li><p>Germany should specialize, at least to some extent, in the
production of video cameras, export video cameras, and import
televisions. Conversely, Poland should specialize, at least to
some extent, in the production of televisions, export
televisions, and import video cameras.</p></li>

<li><p>There are a number of possible advantages of intra-industry trade.
Both nations can take advantage of extreme specialization and
learning in certain kinds of cars with certain traits, like
gas-efficient cars, luxury cars, sport- utility vehicles, higher-
and lower-quality cars, and so on. Moreover, nations can take
advantage of economies of scale, so that large companies will
compete against each other across international borders, providing
the benefits of competition and variety to customers. This same
argument applies to trade between U.S. states, where people often
buy products made by people of other states, even though a similar
product is made within the boundaries of their own state. All
states—and all countries—can benefit from this kind of competition
and trade.</p>

<li><p>Start by plotting the points on a sketch diagram and then
drawing a line through them. The following figure illustrates
the average costs of production of semiconductors.</p>
<img src="Macroeconomics2e-OP_WRQqkIv_files/Image_483.jpg" width="300" height="243" alt="image" />
<p>The curve illustrates economies of scale by showing that as the
scale increases—that is, as production at this particular
factory goes up—the average cost of production declines. The
economies of scale exist up to an output of 40,000
semiconductors; at higher outputs, the average cost of
production does not seem to decline any further.</p>
</li>
<li><p>At any quantity demanded above 40,000, this economy can take
full advantage of economies of scale; that is, it can produce at
the lowest cost per unit. Indeed, if the quantity demanded was
quite high, like 500,000, then there could be a number of
different factories all taking full advantage of economies of
scale and competing with each other. If the quantity demanded
falls below 40,000, then the economy by itself, without foreign
trade, cannot take full advantage of economies of scale.</p></li>
<li><p>The simplest answer to this question is that the small country
could have a large enough factory to take full advantage of
economies of scale, but then export most of the output. For
semiconductors, countries like Taiwan and Korea have recently
fit this description. Moreover, this country could also import
semiconductors from other countries which also have large
factories, thus getting the benefits of competition and variety.
A slightly more complex answer is that the country can get these
benefits of economies of scale without producing semiconductors,
but simply by buying semiconductors made at low cost around the
world. An economy, especially a smaller country, may well end up
specializing and producing a few items on a large scale, but
then trading those items for other items produced on a large
scale, and thus gaining the benefits of economies of scale by
trade, as well as by direct production.</p></li>

<span class="p">A nation might restrict trade on imported products to
protect an industry that is important for national security. For
example, nation X and nation Y may be geopolitical rivals, each with
ambitions of increased political and economic strength. Even if nation Y
has comparative advantage in the production of missile defense systems,
it is unlikely that nation Y would seek to export those goods to nation
X. It is also the case that, for some nations, the production of a
particular good is a key component of national identity. In Japan, the
production of rice is culturally very important.</span></p>
<p>It may be difficult for Japan to import rice from a nation like Vietnam,
even if Vietnam has a comparative advantage in rice production.</p>
<p><span id="bookmark1846">Chapter 21</span></p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>This is the opposite case of the Work It Out feature. A reduced
tariff is like a decrease in the cost of production, which is shown
by a downward (or rightward) shift in the supply curve.</p></li>
<li><p>A subsidy is like a reduction in cost. This shifts the supply curve
down (or to the right), driving the price of sugar down. If the
subsidy is large enough, the price of sugar can fall below the cost
of production faced by foreign producers, which means they will lose
money on any sugar they produce and sell.</p></li>
<li><p>Trade barriers raise the price of goods in protected industries. If
those products are inputs in other industries, it raises their
production costs and then prices, so sales fall in those other
industries. Lower sales lead to lower employment. Additionally, if
the protected industries are consumer goods, their customers pay
higher prices, which reduce demand for other consumer products and
thus employment in those industries.</p></li>
<li><p>Trade based on comparative advantage raises the average wage rate
economy-wide, though it can reduce the incomes of
import-substituting industries. By moving away from a country’s
comparative advantage, trade barriers do the opposite: they give
workers in protected industries an advantage, while reducing the
average wage economy- wide.</p></li>
<li><p>By raising incomes, trade tends to raise working conditions also,
even though those conditions may not (yet) be equivalent to those in
high-income countries.</p></li>
<li><p>They typically pay more than the next-best alternative. If a Nike
firm did not pay workers at least as much as they would earn, for
example, in a subsistence rural lifestyle, they many never come to
work for Nike.</p></li>
<li><p>Since trade barriers raise prices, real incomes fall. The average
worker would also earn less.</p></li>
<li><p>Workers working in other sectors and the protected sector see a
decrease in their real wage.</p></li>
<li><p>If imports can be sold at extremely low prices, domestic firms would
have to match those prices to be competitive. By definition,
matching prices would imply selling under cost and, therefore,
losing money. Firms cannot sustain losses forever. When they leave
the industry, importers can “take over,” raising prices to monopoly
levels to cover their short-term losses and earn long-term profits.</p></li>
<li><p>Because low-income countries need to provide necessities—food,
clothing, and shelter—to their people. In other words, they consider
environmental quality a luxury.</p></li>
<li><p>Low-income countries can compete for jobs by reducing their
environmental standards to attract business to their countries. This
could lead to a competitive reduction in regulations, which would
lead to greater environmental damage. While pollution management is
a cost for businesses, it is tiny relative to other costs, like
labor and adequate infrastructure. It is also costly for firms to
locate far away from their customers, which many low-income
countries are.</p></li>
<li><p>The decision should not be arbitrary or unnecessarily
discriminatory. It should treat foreign companies the same way as
domestic companies. It should be based on science.</p></li>
<li><p>Restricting imports today does not solve the problem. If anything,
it makes it worse since it implies using up domestic sources of the
products faster than if they are imported. Also, the national
security argument can be used to support protection of nearly any
product, not just things critical to our national security.</p></li>
<li><p>The effect of increasing standards may increase costs to the small
exporting country. The supply curve of toys will shift to the left.
Exports will decrease and toy prices will rise. Tariffs also raise
prices. So the effect on the price of toys is the same. A tariff is
a “second best” policy and also affects other sectors. However, a
common standard across countries is a “first best” policy that
attacks the problem at its root.</p></li>
<li><p>A free trade association offers free trade between its members, but
each country can determine its own trade policy outside the
association. A common market requires a common external trade policy
in addition to free trade within the group. An economic union is a
common market with coordinated fiscal and monetary policy.</p></li>
<li><p>International agreements can serve as a political counterweight to
domestic special interests, thereby preventing stronger
protectionist measures.</p></li>
<li><p>Reductions in tariffs, quotas, and other trade barriers, improved
transportation, and communication media have made people more aware
of what is available in the rest of the world.</p></li>
<li><p>Competition from firms with better or cheaper products can reduce a
business’s profits, and may drive it out of business. Workers would
similarly lose income or even their jobs.</p></li>
<li><p>Consumers get better or less expensive products. Businesses with the
better or cheaper products increase their profits. Employees of
those businesses earn more income. On balance, the gains outweigh
the losses to a nation.</p></li>

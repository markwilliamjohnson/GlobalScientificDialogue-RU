    "## Why Digitalization?\n",
    "Barely a day goes by without someone mentioning the rapid advances in the way the internet is shaping our lives.  From the miraculous achievements of Articial Intelligence to the political problems produced by social media, the 'digital' is becoming increasingly important. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is often said that the jobs of tomorrow don't exist yet. But there are indications as to the kinds of skills that are increasingly important in industry: \n",
    "1. Skills in making sense from complex data\n",
    "2. SKills in presenting and visualising data\n",
    "3. Skills in developing new kinds of application\n",
    "4. Skill in communicating between highly technical levels and deeply human\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases and in many courses across the University, some of these skills are being taught. But it can be supported better, and it can be coordinated and developed more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, these workshops are designed to identify:\n",
    "1. What aspects of digitalisation already exist in the departments?\n",
    "2. What would digitalisation change about the humanities?\n",
    "3. How do humanities professors define digitalisation?\n",
    "4. What role do professors see for themselves within the digitisation initiative?\n",

    "participants write down their definition of digitalisation\n",
    "the definitions are compiled (model the use of text processing libraries)\n",
    "discuss the overlap, differences, and themes among the responses\n",
    "extension: if time and interest allow, the groups definitions could be compared to existing ones in the literature, university, or online\n",
    "## objectives\n",
    "participants reflect on their own understanding of what digitalisation is\n",
    "model using text analysis to identify core ideas that constitute digitalisation (set up discussion of the uses and limitations of text analysis)\n",
    "#### build a working model of digitalisation that is relevant and field specific\n",

    "## how fields change\n",
    "activity—questions presented during the lecture culminating in discussion\n",
    "best case scenario, how would your field change in the next 10 years\n",
    "collect responses and identify the most extreme or contentious\n",
    "have participants rank their top ones\n",
    "discuss if they are aligned or misaligned with technological changes\n",
    "optional: have groups split into same-field groups and analyse a different fields future vision\n",
    "## objectives\n",
    "hold attention\n",

# The Purpose of this Workshop

The 2023 Strategy has made a priority of Digitalization in education in the University. This workshop is an introduction to the topic of digitalization, and provides an opportunity to capture your own thoughts about the fast-changing technological environment we all inhabit, while also providing first introduction to the tools and techniques of data analysis.

We have designed a set of activitites which both fulfil the need to identify the thoughts and ideas of teachers in faculties, whilst using this data collection activity as a way of providing a meaningful context for introducing you to digitalization tools.

The workshop is divided into three sets of activities:

- In the first set of activities, you are asked to engage with a set of questionnaires, making comparisons between different value positions with regard to the future of education, and different opinions about what matters. 

- In the second set of activities, we will show you how digitalization tools can analyze this data, using this workbook as a live programming tool. (If you are interested in the workbook itself, we will show you how to make one yourself!)

- In the final set of activities, we want you to think about how you might introduce a digital activity in your discipline, describing the tools, activities, objectives and challenges of doing this.

We hope you enjoy it!



## Why Digitalization?
Barely a day goes by without someone mentioning the rapid advances in the way the internet is shaping our lives.  From the miraculous achievements of Articial Intelligence to the political problems produced by social media, the 'digital' is becoming increasingly important. 

It is often said that the jobs of tomorrow don't exist yet. But there are indications as to the kinds of skills that are increasingly important in industry: 
1. Skills in making sense from complex data
2. SKills in presenting and visualising data
3. Skills in developing new kinds of application
4. Skill in communicating between highly technical levels and deeply human

In many cases and in many courses across the University, some of these skills are being taught. But it can be supported better, and it can be coordinated and developed more effectively.

### Purpose of the workshop

For this reason, these workshops are designed to identify:
- What aspects of digitalisation already exist in the departments?
- What would digitalisation change about the humanities?
- How do teachers define digitalisation?
- Why do teachers think digitalization is attracting so much attention?
- Is it a good thing?

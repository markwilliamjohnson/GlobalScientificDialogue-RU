Global Scientific Dialogue: Introduction For Students 
=========================

University is about more than getting a degree certificate. Over the
three or four years that you are at university, there are many things
that happen which will profoundly affect the way in which your life will
develop. Very few of these things will concern knowledge of economics,
business, environmental management, or whatever it is you happen to be
studying. All of these things will involve conversations: with friends,
fellow students, teachers, girlfriends and boyfriends, flatmates,
employers, people you meet by chance, family members, bank managers,
university administrators, and so on.

This book guides you through a series topics for conversation about the
world today: about your future work, your hopes for career. And about
technology, science, art, creativity and interpersonal engagement. It
has been assembled in collaboration between academics from the
University of Liverpool, University of Hamburg and teachers at the Far
Eastern Federal University. Some of the perspectives come from different
disciplines: tourism, management, environment, and so on.

In all of these conversations, individuals come from different
backgrounds, they have different problems, they have different skills,
they have different political views, but somehow, they all have
something to offer which anyone can unlock if they really know how to
talk to each other. One of the most important skills in life is knowing
how to engage with people from many different backgrounds, skills, and
knowledge. This is a skill which cannot be taught as a single topic. It
has to be introduced as a challenge to interface with many different
ways of thinking and many disciplines. This is what Global Scientific
Dialogue will do.

Global Scientific Dialogue is unlike any course you will study at
University. Indeed, we think it is a unique course worldwide. To start
with, it is not a course which runs for 14 weeks, with assessments at
the end. It is a course which runs intensively for two weeks. In those
two weeks, you are going to be introduced to a rich array of different
ideas, ways of thinking, technologies and students from many different
courses in the Management School.

We want you to talk to each other about the things which you see and
engage with. Your teachers are not experts in any of the ideas and
fields that will be presented to you. Indeed, we don't yet know how many
of the topics which are going to be presented to you are going to change
the world, or disappear into obscurity. Your teachers are, however,
going to encourage you to ask questions like:

-   What do you mean by that?

-   Can you think of an example where that isn't true?

-   What does it mean to be 'right'?

-   Can you think of another way of describing that?

These are questions which we should ask each other all the time. In an
uncertain world, we need to understand each others' uncertainty. But
there is a skill to asking powerful questions, and cutting to the heart
of the issues in organisations, businesses and society that really
matter. Global Scientific Dialogue is about helping you to develop these
skills to ask powerful questions of each other.

The Core principles of the course 
=================================

Wicked Problems 
---------------

In all fields of work today, individuals are dealing with complexity.
There are many problems in the modern workplace which do not appear to
have easy solutions. Sometimes these are called "wicked
problems"[@rittel_dilemmas_1973]. Rittel describes Wicked Problems as:

> "problems that are difficult or impossible to solve because of
> incomplete, contradictory, and changing requirements that are often
> difficult to recognize."

Examples of wicked problems include the management of risks in
healthcare, or the management of the environment, or in the stimulation
of innovation in an economy, or in attempts to encourage students and
staff to learn new things in a university. In none of these situations
is there a clear 'right answer': in all of them, there are degrees of
uncertainty with which workers have to negotiate.

In each of these examples, *wicked problems* present many different
dimensions: some scientific, some technological, some communicative,
some cultural, some creative, and so on. No single perspective provides
a way to dealing with the problem. The best good teams can do is to talk
and listen to each other in order to act informed by a wide range of
perspectives and disciplinary knowledge.

Technology is increasing the complex demands of work, and it is
ever-more important that students understand the nature of highly
complex 'wicked problems'.

Creativity, flexibility, understanding of technology, communication and
the ability to communicate across many different disciplines is
extremely important in helping to ensure that wicked problems do not
become major disasters in the workplace. That means that students need
to learn new kinds of skills: it is not enough to have knowledge of a
single subject. You need to be creative, flexible, to understand
technology and to be able to communicate with many different kinds of
people.

Global Scientific Dialogue is a course which teaches approaches to
dealing with 'wicked problems'. On Global Scientific Dialogue you will
encounter many ideas which lie outside your specialised subject area.
These include:

-   Current scientific thinking in physics and biology

-   Trans-disciplinarity

-   Teamwork

-   Conversation

-   Innovative uses of technology

-   Understanding data

-   Listening

-   Creativity

Although you have gained much disciplinary knowledge in the various
fields of management and economics, this course complements your
disciplinary knowledge by providing a way of connecting different
aspects of knowledge with your understanding and curiosity about the
real world.

There is no 'one-size-fits-all' approach to this. Each of you will have
to find your own way, by tuning-in to the things that interest you.

This book has been prepared to help you. Although it is organised into
chapters, it is not designed to be read from cover-to-cover. Instead,
open it at a random page, and study what you see. Then open it at a
different page and study that, comparing it to what you saw before.

-   Each page contains a different topic.

-   Each topic has a series of questions for you to ask yourself

-   Each topic has a body of text which explains why the topic is
    important

-   Each topic has links to literature and other resources to help you
    think about the topic.

When you open this book, open your mind. Your brain is the most powerful
computer in the world. Let it make the connections as you let your
imagination and curiosity wander. We hope you enjoy the experience!

Technology
==========

Why Technology? 
----------------

**KEY QUESTIONS:**

-   How much time do you spend online?

-   How much time do you spend responding or browsing social media?

-   Could you live without your phone? or the internet?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Technology has fundamentally changed the environment. You are the
    first generation who cannot remember a world without the internet.


    ![image](techgreek.jpg)

-   Technology is transforming the world of employment. Many traditional
    jobs have been automated, and many of the traditional careers like
    law, teaching, business and management have been fundamentally and
    unrecognisably transformed by technology. Whatever career you choose
    for yourself - whether teaching, medicine, stock trading, even being
    an artist - it is highly likely that much of it will involve staring
    at screens and working with software.

-   Technology is always changing. It will always continue to change.

The Computer
------------

**KEY QUESTIONS:**

-   What does the computer do to humans?

-   What has the computer done to society?

-   How can we live in harmony with computers in the future?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Technology and computers allow new forms of control over humans.

-   Computers have created a new kind of human-machine system in
    society, where constraints can be very easily manipulated. We don't
    fully understand how our new human-machine system is different from
    the social system of our parents.

-   Computers facilitate the manipulation of constraints. The way a
    computer screen presents changing possibilities for action as we
    type a phrase into a search engine, click on the hyperlinks which
    are presented to us, and then negotiate whatever new possibilities
    for action have been programmed into particular webpages,
    illustrates the way that constraints can be changed.
    ![image](alzheimers.jpg)

-   The human experience of this process reminds us of the human-machine
    system we are in: very real emotions arise in response to mechanical
    processes, not dissimilar to the fundamental emotional impact of
    physical constraints such as prison walls, one-way traffic systems,
    central heating or alarm clocks.

-   The word 'com-puter' comes from latin "*com-putare*". 'Putare' means
    to *comtemplate* - so the computer is means of contemplating-with.
    With what kind of science might we investigate this, and with what
    kind of tools might we now organise ourselves?

The Internet as a 'Lifeworld'
-----------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS:**

-   How has the computer affected what we think of as 'real'?

-   How has the computer affected what we think of as 'true' or 'false'?

-   How has the computer affected the way we feel?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   The concept of 'Lifeworld' is a way of talking about your everyday
    environment: everything that you think of as being the 'real world'.

-   Each of us has different views of reality, and while some things
    like rocks and trees appear to be universal, we only think this
    because we observe others behaving in predictable ways with rocks
    and trees.

-   Something happens *between* us in the 'real world'. The word
    'intersubjective' describes what happens between us. Husserl and
    Schutz both referred to the concept of the 'lifeworld' as the
    *context* within which intersubjective engagement occurs.
    ![image](lifeworld.jpg)

-   The computer has transformed the Lifeworld of everyone. Have our
    lifeworlds become unstable? The one shared environment within which
    our expectations could be coordinated has changed into multiple
    lifeworlds within which individuals move in and out.

-   Even in face-to-face settings like lectures, students will often
    inhabit different lifeworlds as they explore social media or other
    online distractions.

Social Media
------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   What is the difference between talking on a social media forum and
    talking to someone face-to-face?

-   Who do you talk to when you post on a social media forum?

-   How do you know that you have really communicated with someone on
    social media?

-   How do you know you have really communicated with someone
    face-to-face?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Imagine a private conversation between you and a friend: the words
    one of you says are only heard by the other person, and their words
    are only heard by you. Of course, they might tell others what you
    said, but that would be *another* private conversation.

-   Social media expands the audience of any potential communication, so
    you're no longer talking to *one* person, but to potentially
    millions.

-   When you talk face-to-face, in order to communicate, you must convey
    the *meaning* of what you want to say. Sometimes you have to choose
    your words carefully. You can judge whether the other person
    understands by how they react to what you say. If they don't react
    as you expected, do you try and say the same thing in a different
    way?

-   Is your communication successful if the way the person you are
    talking to talks and behaves in a way you expect them to? This
    process was theorised by a sociologist called Talcott Parsons, who
    called it 'Double
    Contingency'[@parsons_social_2012; @luhmann_social_1996]

-   Because social media communicates with thousands of people, your
    communication could be successful with *somebody* among those
    thousands of people even if you don't adjust how you say it.

-   That means that any social media communication may potentially be
    successful with somebody within a networked set of possible
    respondents.

Social Media Networks and Communication
---------------------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   How does the number of people on social media change the way we
    choose to communicate?

-   How do we decide which media platform we will use to communicate?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   The diagram above illustrates the communication challenge of social
    media

-   A *sender* thinks of a message to send over an electronic connection
    which contains 'noise' of different kinds (for example, different
    understandings, different cultures, etc)

-   There are many (millions) of possible receivers

-   Among one or two of those receivers, somebody will understand the
    message and forward it on to an even larger audience.

![image](socialmedia1.jpg)


Confirmation Bias and Trolling
------------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Why has social media seen an explosion in online abuse, misogyny,
    racism, trolling, stalking and fake news?

-   What is it about online communication that means that people feel
    free to say things which they wouldn't say face-to-face?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   'Confirmation bias' is the name given to how communications are
    shaped by the communications of others.

-   Social media provides ways in which a very large audience can be
    manipulated with messages which many might disagree with, but which
    get passed around the internet.

-   'Trolling' is a form of abuse which relies on confirmation bias.
    Abusive or thoughtless messages are made because a community exists
    that will approve of them, but also such communities will also
    approve of the disrupting effects of those messages.

-   The selection of audience over utterance or multiple description can
    exacerbate political uncertainty to which institutional structures
    have to react.

-   Sometimes, the reaction of institutions like governments makes the
    uncertainty worse.

What does technology do?
------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   When somebody invents a new tool, how often does it provide a new
    way of doing something we could have done before?

-   How often does it provide a way of doing something which there was
    no way of doing before?

-   Why does one technology replace another? Why do some technologies
    fail to find users?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Any new technology creates a new option for doing something. A long
    time ago, the only way of moving around would have been to walk, or
    to ride a horse. New options were created by railways, cars, planes
    and so on.

-   It's the same with communicating: once upon a time, we would have to
    have been with the person we are talking to. New options were
    created by writing, printing, the telephone and the internet?
    ![image](techreal.jpg)

-   Today we have bewildering choice: whether to write a letter, an
    email, a tweet, a text, a phone call?

-   Every new option for doing something creates more uncertainty in the
    decision to do something: **Technology creates uncertainty**

-   Technology can also limit our options for acting in certain ways: a
    locked gate or fence can constrain where humans can move in the
    world.

-   Computer systems today present users with 'forms' for them to fill
    in information like your name, address, phone number, password, etc.
    They constrain: **Technology limits options**.

-   Technology like computers do use algorithms to generate new ways of
    looking at the world which without of them we would not have access
    to.

-   **Technology *amplifies* descriptions of the world.**

-   **The computer does all of these three things at once.**


Technology and Feedback
-----------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   In what ways are you like a robot?

-   In what ways are you like a plant?

-   How do you adapt to your environment?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   The modern computer was developed in the 1940s as a consequence of
    technological innovations which arose from the Second World War.

-   One of the principles of the modern computer was the concept of
    *feedback*: where a system's outputs are connected to its inputs. It
    was noted that systems with feedback exhibited 'lifelike' behaviour,
    and many scientists were fascinated by this lifelike behaviour right
    at the beginning of the computer's evolution.

-   Today's technologies of AI and Big Data rely on feedback. More
    importantly, most of the techniques and technologies of AI are not
    new, but were invented at the same time as the digital computer - in
    the late 1940s by some of the leading figures of cybernetics: Warren
    McCulloch, Norbert Wiener, John Von Neumann

-   What is new today is that we have wired every human being on the
    planet into an information network, so that the principles of
    intelligence and feedback imagined in the 1940s are now operating on
    human beings within this network.

-   Russian cybernetics and computing started after the death of Stalin,
    who had banned cybernetics because he thought it was anti-communist.
    People like Victor Glushkov were pioneers of computing in Russia.

Decentralisation
----------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Does the internet have to be made of servers which store files
    accessed by users who type web addresses?

-   What happens when one of those servers (e.g. google) stops working?

-   Is there an alternative way of organising files where they exist
    everywhere, rather than a single place? What are the implications of
    organising things differently?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   When the internet was developed, the idea was that every machine
    should be connected to every other machine, with no central point of
    control.

-   The protocol through which the web works, *Hyper-text Transport
    Protocol* (http), relies on having servers which deliver documents.

-   As the web has evolved, it has reproduced the centralised structure
    of society where corporations and governments have high-profile
    websites. So instead of a free and open web where everyone is equal,
    we have a web dominated by a few corporations.

-   Web decentalisation focuses on how to reduce the burden on single
    servers by spreading files over many servers. It also looks at
    distributing internet access to parts of the world where building
    infrastructure isn't viable like rural areas. It also seeks to
    address citizen worries about surveillance.

-   Blockchain is one form of decentralisation, but there also emerging
    technologies like the Inter-planetary file system
    (<http://ipfs.io>), and a few similar decentralising protocols like
    DAT (<https://datproject.org/>).

-   The hardware to support decentralisation is also developing. The
    Gotenna device (see <https://www.gotenna.com/pages/mesh>) is a small
    radio repeater which carries a signal for 4 miles, and can easily
    form a mesh network with other Gotenna recievers in the
    neighbourhood.

Blockchain and Bitcoin
----------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Is a currency possible without a central bank?

-   If an institution like a bank can be replaced with technology, what
    about other institutions like universities?

-   If institutions provide trust in a currency, how does technology
    establish an equal degree of trust?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   One of the functions of institutions like banks, universities or
    hospitals is to provide trust in their services. People use the
    institutions because they have trust in the honesty of what the
    institution does.

-   A banknote, for example, usually contains a 'promise' by the bank to
    pay the sum which is written on the paper BitCoin provides a way in
    which trust can be established simply with an algorithm, rather than
    requiring an institution.
    ![image](blockchain.png)

-   Equally important is that the BitCoin algorithm is a distributed
    technology called a *Blockchain* which doesn't store details of
    transactions on any single server.

-   Instead, the Blockchain algorithm is a "chain of digital signatures"
    which act as an open and transparent ledger of transactions in the
    Bitcoin currency [@nakamoto_bitcoin:_nodate]

-   The blockchain has two principal innovations which have ensured that
    the ledger is trusted. Firstly, the entire blockchain - the list of
    all transactions - is distributed and duplicated throughout the
    internet. Secondly, the veracity of the blockchain ledger is assured
    by a process called 'mining'. This is a data-intensive process which
    aims to identify any anomalies in the ledger. Mining serves a dual
    purpose: whilst it ensures the ledger is accurate, it also rewards
    those who find inconsistencies with the creation of new Bitcoins,
    thus tying the mechanism of verification with the control of the
    money supply (a function normally carried out by a central bank)
    [@vigna_cryptocurrency:_2016]


Artificial Intelligence
-----------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   How does Google translate work?

-   What might AI be able to do in the future?

-   What will it not be able to do?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Simple machines with feedback can produce life-like phenomena. For a
    long time, people have asked 'Can we build an artificial brain?'

-   In the 1950s and 60s, cybernetics was the emerging discipline within
    which these developments could be considered together.

-   What we now call 'machine learning' also belongs to this period.
    Machine learning has its roots in the work of one of the pioneers of
    early cybernetics, Warren McCulloch. McCulloch saw that the neural
    structures of the brain were multiple interconnections. In
    describing the logic of this structure, McCulloch coined the term
    'heterarchy'.

-   Neural networks have many interconnected nodes and these can be
    trained to identify the different characteristics of "a thing to be
    recognised". For example, if we want a neural network to recognise a
    picture of a rabbit, the network is exposed to many pictures of
    rabbits (a training set). With enough pictures, it learns the
    characteristics of 'rabbit-ness' from these so that new images of
    rabbits can be successfully identified.

-   Google Translate works in a similar way: it has millions of examples
    of text in different languages which it feeds into its neural
    network. That learns how to convert one to the other. It also learns
    from the preferences of users when they use it.

-   Machine learning depends on having thousands of items to train it.
    If thousands of items are not available, machine learning is
    unlikely to be very good.

Google has an open source machine learning project called TensorFlow,
with many examples of machine learning: <https://www.tensorflow.org/>

There are some impressive demos of machine learning in the arts as part
of the Magenta project: <https://magenta.tensorflow.org/demos>


Surveillance and Big Data
-------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   How much does Facebook, VK, Whatsapp or your internet service
    provider know about you?

-   Is it a problem that technology companies know so much about you?

-   Is it a problem that governments might know so much about you?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Everything we do online records data which is sent back to the
    providers of online services we use.

-   Providers of online services adapt the service they provide to us
    based on what they know about us: so if you shop on amazon for
    something, you will receive adverts for that thing in other web
    pages. ![image](cambridgeanalytica.jpg)

-   This recording of personal data is unprecedented in human history:
    it is not the 'connectedness' of people that is new with the
    internet (we have always been interconnected as human beings); it is
    the capacity for the strategic organisation, recall and manipulation
    of data about humans to then change the behaviour of humans.

-   The collection of personal data is related to the centralisation of
    the internet. If the internet was decentralised, then personal data
    could be stored under the control of the individual who creates it.

-   Individuals could then sell their own data to corporations if they
    wished.

-   The Cambridge Analytica scandal recently showed how personal data is
    being used by large corporations for commercial and political
    advantages.

Attenuations
------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   What would you rather share: your Facebook/VK password or your
    toothbrush?

-   In what ways do computers present you with barriers to doing things?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Technology forces us to behave in certain ways, demanding use of
    electronic forms, passwords, user permissions, firewalls and so on.

-   The earliest example of the *form* was developed during the first
    world war. *Form A2042* was the name given to the 'Field Service
    Post Card', upon which soldiers could send brief messages home by
    crossing-out the options which did not apply. Paul Fussell claims it
    was

    > 'the progenitor of of all modern forms on which you fill in things
    > or cross out things or check off things, from police traffic
    > summonses to "questionnaires" and income-tax blanks.'
    > [@fussell_great_2013]

-   The Field Service Post-Card is an attenuator which reinforces
    control by a central authority or hierarchy (in this case, the
    British army). The form's restricted structure prevented soldiers
    saying too much.

-   Hierarchies maintain themselves by attenuating the flow of
    information between themselves and their environment.

    ![image](a2042.jpg)

-   Today's computer forms do more than attenuate the communication of
    individuals. Computer tools also *amplify* the patterns of behaviour
    gained by capturing many people engaging with the form. Modern
    computer technology can dynamically adapt the constraints within
    which users engage with the system.

-   social media platforms present content to users which in a way where
    the behaviour of users might be anticipated.

Some More Questions about your future and technology
----------------------------------------------------

-   Are you going to get a job without understanding where technology is
    going?

-   Why is it important to understand technology?

-   Is a good society possible in a world of technology?

-   What should politicians understand about technology?

Art and Creativity 
===================

Artists and Scientists
----------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Is it possible to articulate a scientifically-grounded description
    of the activity of a creative artist?

-   What do artists and scientists have in common?

-   How are they different?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Artistic thinking seems fundamentally different from scientific
    thinking; the type of people who work in the sciences and in the
    arts seem fundamentally different. Yet great original scientists
    such as Tesla, and great artists such as Leonardo appear to have
    much in common.

-   Scientists create abstractions which describe the world with
    equations and models. Artists create abstractions which describe the
    world in paint, light, sound, movement.

-   Both produce multiple descriptions of the world, and generating new
    possibilities for looking at the world. Artists are important
    because they show us how to look at the world differently.

![image](cajal.jpg)


Are you an artist?
------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   How many times do you take photographs on your phone?

-   How many times do you post photographs on Social Media (VK,
    Facebook, etc)

-   What are you doing when you do this?

-   How many descriptions of your life are on social media?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   If artistic thinking is about creating multiple descriptions of
    reality, then we are more artistic than we might think!

-   Every time we take a photograph we create a description. In posting
    on social media, we add that description to our other descriptions
    which are there. We also add it to the descriptions of others.
    ![image](instagram.png)

-   However, there is a difference between what we do and what an artist
    might do: artists assemble multiple descriptions of things so that
    they become coherent.

-   Artists find the common pattern between different descriptions.
    Artistic skill involves manipulating multiple descriptions to reveal
    their common pattern.

-   Finding a common pattern is a way of speaking about a deeper sense
    of reality.

Multiple Descriptions in Video
------------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   If you want to learn to fix a leaking tap or a fault in your car, do
    you look for some text on Wikipedia or do you look for a YouTube
    video?

-   When you watch a youtube video, what happens to you over time?

-   At a key moment of surprise in a video, what are the elements which
    cause the surprise?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Video presents multiple descriptions of the world over time.

-   The multiple descriptions presented by video have many dimensions
    and change over time.

-   Edgar Morin, in his book "Cinema and the imaginary man"
    [@morin_cinema_2005], details the different descriptions that the
    cinema presents. These include:

    -   the way that light and shadow changes

    -   the way that the size of objects change

    -   the way that the sound and music of a movie changes

        ![image](vertov.jpg)

        newpage
    -   the way that speech changes

    -   the way that the camera moves

    -   the cutting of one shot to the next

    -   ... and so on ...

-   Morin's different dimensions are related. In asking how YouTube
    communicates multiple descriptions over time, we can ask about the
    structural relationship between its different elements.

-   Many of these issues of the moving image were considered in Russian
    cinema - particularly in the work of Vertov and Eisenstein.

Multiple Descriptions in Poetry
-------------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   How is poetry like video?

-   How is poetry like science?

-   How does a poet describe something which has no name - like a
    feeling?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Text appears to be a much less rich medium than video. However, in
    poetry, text can be used to convey deep things which lie beyond any
    individual word.

-   The way text is able to do this is by layering different
    descriptions of something on top of one another.

-   In poetry, descriptions are not just in the words themselves, but in
    their rhythm and in the way that they rhyme.

-   With the kind of overlaying of descriptions Ezra Pound describes how
    it is that words are assembled from other words. To define 'red',
    for example, Pound asks

    > "How can the poet to do it in a picture that isn't painted in red
    > paint? He puts (or his ancestor put) together the abbreviated
    > pictures of
    >
    >   ----------- ----------
    >   ROSE        CHERRY
    >   IRON RUST   FLAMINGO
    >   ----------- ----------
    >
-   Pound argues that this

    > is very much the kind of thing a biologist does (in a very much
    > more complicated way) when he gets together a few hundred or
    > thousand slides, and picks out what is necessary for his general
    > statement. Something that fits the case, that applies in all of
    > the cases."

Computer-generated Objects
--------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Could a computer be an artist?

-   Much modern art now uses computers - what do the computers
    contribute to artistic expression?

-   What is the difference between a computer-generated object and a
    natural object?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   The computer generates lights on a screen to create virtual
    'objects'. These virtual objects can be easily manipulated, and
    algorithms can generate infinite variations of an object

-   Human beings point at computer-generated objects and in the process
    reveal something about themselves in relation to them. Since there
    are many different computer-generated objects, there are many
    possible ways in which individuals might reveal something about
    themselves.

-   With 3D printing, computers are able to create an increasing array
    of physical objects, including paper documents, 3D printed models
    and even buildings.

    ![image](google-machine-learning-art.jpg)

-   Practical uses of computer-generated objects include the use of
    adaptive algorithms to maximise the performance of a vehicle (for
    example, 'genetic algorithms'), or the use of shared 3D
    architectural plans in the design of a building (a technology known
    as 'Building Information Modelling')

-   Virtual reality is another example of computer-generated objects
    which provide multiple descriptions of the world.

-   Visualisations (or 'visual analytics') of data can also provide many
    different descriptions of reality, highlighting particular features
    of the data about which people can talk.

Emoji communication
-------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Why do people send smileys, or WeChat stickers to each other in
    communications?

-   What is the difference between using a word for something and a
    sticker?

-   If you were to respond to this question with a sticker, what would
    it be?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Since the advent of texting, communications have been increasingly
    augmented with pictures and symbols.

-   Each sticker has particular structural properties which are
    presented in a single moment. Many stickers are animations, and
    present information over time. The structure of single moment is
    what is called *synchronic* and the unfolding over time is called
    *diachronic* ![image](wechat.jpg)

-   Conversations work in a similar way: they comprise diachronic and
    synchronic aspects, each contributing multiple descriptions which
    are coordinated throughout the process.

-   Combining stickers and words creates complex mixtures of different
    elements all of which are saying similar things in different ways.

-   When you send stickers to each other, are you being an artist?


Creativity and Happiness
------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Does being creative make you happy? If so, why?

-   Is mental illness related to creativity?

-   When you express a feeling that is inside, what changes occur in
    your environment?

-   When you express a feeling that is inside, what changes occur in
    you?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   The creative process is one of the highest attainments of the human
    intellect. Within hierarchies of learning such as Bloom's taxonomy
    [@bloom_taxonomy_1956], we find 'creativity' at the top of a range
    of intellectual achievement from memory recall at the bottom to
    synthesis and analysis in the middle.

-   In psychoanalytical approaches to the creative process, it has been
    suggested that creativity is a state of being which connects the Ego
    (the self) with the Id (the unconscious) in a continual process
    [@read_education_1958; @ehrenzweig_hidden_1968; @milner_not_2010].

-   Mental illness is characterised as "creativity gone
    wrong"[@ehrenzweig_hidden_1968].

-   This can be compared to Freud's therapeutic process which is
    conversationally-oriented (a 'talking cure'), drawing out utterances
    from the patient where the 'primary process' material of dreams is
    summoned into the world of the Ego and language.

-   The cure for psychological trauma through this conversational
    process lies in the articulating of psychodynamic blockages and
    bringing them into the therapist-patient conversation.

![image](ehrenzweig.jpg) *Labyrinth (sequential
structure) of creative search. The creative thinker must move forward on
a broad front, revealing many options. He should get a comprehensive
look at the whole structure of the way forward, without being able to
focus on any one opportunity.*

Mental Process, Individuation and Successful people
---------------------------------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   What is it to know who you are?

-   How have successful people, across all fields, developed such a
    strong sense of self-identity which gives them confidence to act in
    the world?

-   What is the balance between mind and action among successful people?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   'Individuation' is Jung's term for the process whereby the self
    emerges from undifferentiated unconciousness.

-   The essential concept of a dynamic relation between the components
    of consciousness is similar to Freud's relation between Ego, Id and
    Superego.

-   What happens between the therapist and the patient in psychoanalysis
    is a process of drawing-out things from the subconscious into
    consciousness, through turning subconscious phenomena into
    communications with the therapist. Психический процесс,
    индивидуализация и успешные люди

-   Rebalancing is essential to individuation: it is what happens when
    the uncertainty of the psyche is balanced with the management of
    uncertainty of social relations to the point where the individual
    can see themselves as 'whole' and distinct from other individuals
    and other things.

-   In Jungian psychoanalysis, individuation is assisted through
    recognition of fundamental *archetypes* in what Jung calls the
    *collective unconscious*.


Uncertainty
-----------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   When you are uncertain about something, what do you do?

-   To what extent is uncertainty in the individual mind, and to what
    extent is it in the social environment?

-   Why in conversation important for the management of uncertainty?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Uncertainty is present in the individual mind - nobody is entirely
    sure of everything

-   Uncertainty is also present in the social environment: because
    nobody is sure of anything, there is much argument about the meaning
    of things, political issues, scientific knowledge, and so on.

-   Systems modelling techniques can help in exploring the relationship
    between the management of uncertainty in the psyche and the
    management of uncertainty in the environment.

-   Drawing the uncertainty management process in this way helps to
    connect both the psychodynamic mechanism of Freud with the
    relational mechanism of Bowlby in a coherent way. It further
    suggests that the damage to attachment relations will inevitably
    have psychodynamic effects.

-   The struggle to manage uncertainty with regard to proximity to a
    caregiver must be related to some deeper uncertainty concerning the
    undifferentiated experience of a baby (and indeed, the mother), and
    the more concrete 'categories' of experience which arise whereby
    'proximity' becomes a thing over which the child attempts to
    exercise control. In this way, the undifferentiated subconscious of
    the baby and the mother, and the mechanism by which the uncertainty
    of the subconscious is managed form a coherent part of the
    attachment process.


Generosity
----------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   How might generosity help to manage uncertainty?

-   Are artists generous in the way they express themselves?

-   Is being open in the way that emotions are expressed similar to
    being generous?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Imagine giving a present to someone: a gift is a highly complex
    object open to many interpretations. It's meaning is often
    ambiguous. It is this ambiguity which makes it powerful.

-   When exchanging something for money, the meaning and value of the
    exchange must be clear to all who participate in it. A gift,
    however, is an object which functions by revealing something of the
    inner worlds of the giver and the receiver.

    ![image](potlatch.jpg)

-   A gift is an invitation to reveal individual uncertainty to one
    another, bringing it into the social domain where conversation can
    produce new dynamics which maintain social cohesion.

-   Anthropologist George Bataille [@bataille_accursed_1991], thought
    deeply about gifts. Influenced by Mauss's concept of potlatch
    [@mauss_gift:_2011], Bataille argued that gifts within communities
    were processes of acknowledging the fundamental uncertainties of
    existence.

-   In giving, Bataille argues that squander or waste was then the
    principal act, and in primitive society it took the form of human
    sacrifice and lavish feasts.

-   In modern society it can take the form of exuberant behaviour - from
    art to football matches.

Why Science Matters
===================

Physics
-------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Everybody is told in school about mass, space, time and electric
    charge. But what are these things? How do we know they are real?

-   Why is there no coherent uncontested theory of everything which
    unites relativity with quantum mechanics

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   There was a time when science believed that the natural world made
    itself available to calculation and prediction. Scientific
    observation produced objectivity.[@wiener_human_1988]
    ![image](quantum.jpg)

-   Scientific facts were indisputable, and the scientific practices of
    physics became the blueprint for inquiry into society, economics,
    the arts and education.

-   Einstein's questions concerned the perception of scientists:
    perception was relative to light, space and time

-   In Quantum Mechanics observation was not only relative to the
    context in which it acts, but tied-up in the very structure of the
    natural world: observation changes the world.

-   Consequently, modern physics has become a process of accurately
    measuring uncertainties expressed as probabilities. This is what
    physicists are talking about when they talk about a 'wave function'.


Biology
-------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Which came first, the cell or DNA?

-   How does a molecule (DNA) come to be *about* another molecule?

-   What is the relationship between cells and atoms?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Life is cellular. But what is a cell? In school we learn that
    biology is a very different subject from physics. Biology concerns
    living processes, feedback, homeostasis, and so on. Physics concerns
    eternal mechanical laws. We accept that biological systems are made
    of atoms and molecules, but the connection between the processes of
    the mechanisms of atoms and molecules and the living processes of a
    growing embryo are shrouded in mystery.

    ![image](quantum_biology.jpg)

-   What would science look like if we saw biology and physics as one?
    The impact of Quantum mechanics on biological systems is exciting a
    lot of interest at the moment, as biological phenomena such as
    sensation are being successfully explained by Quantum phenomena.

-   DNA is a molecule which, biology tells us, is *about* other
    molecules. That means the molecules in DNA *refer to* the molecules
    in proteins which are expressed by it. How can a molecule be about
    another molecule? Where did that begin?

-   In both biology and physics there are a large number of basic things
    which we do not know. What happens at the quantum level? What is
    mass, time or space? Everyone talks about 'energy' - but what's
    that? Why is it that everything in nature appears to be meshed
    together - planets, plants, stars, man, consciousness?

-   Communication and information appear to be fundamental things at the
    subatomic level. Yet the real challenge here is that this subatomic
    level gives rise to our own biology and our own consciousness which
    in turn is able to think about its fundamental origins!


Deciding to Kill the Planet
---------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Are ecological problems the result of human failure to make good
    decisions?

-   How can humans make better decisions?

-   Why are humans so short-sighted in their development of new
    technologies?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   In the early 1970s, Cohen and March developed a model of
    organisational decision-making called the 'Garbage can model of
    organisational choice' [@cohen_garbage_1972]. This model described
    how humans rarely solve complex problems, but instead try to turn
    complex problems into easy problems by deciding to implement some
    technology which was already in existence. Cohen and March
    highlighted that this was often a cause of greater complexity and
    unmanageability.

-   When humans make decisions, either at an individual level, or at the
    level of corporations, governing bodies, ministerial agencies,
    political conferences, international agreements or pressure groups,
    brains come together to coordinate a collective course of action
    suitable for the group.

-   Damage persists upheld by webs of institutions, including
    universities, each seeking to uphold their identity and mission,
    including students who qualify from universities.

-   Decisions are made within constraints. There are the immediate
    constraints which include the available information about the
    situation, the skills and capabilities of individuals, psychology,
    technological resources, and communication channels for coordinating
    action.

-   More subtle constraints include power relations within the
    decision-making group and the broader political background of
    decision-making.

-   Decisions are made in an inter-subjective context, even when they
    are the decisions by an individual for their own needs. For example,
    students faced with choosing a subject or an institution must deal
    with multiple constraints, amongst which include information about
    judgements by others as to their suitability to a particular course,
    information about career prospects, information about alternatives,
    information about costs, as well as self-evaluation of desires,
    uncertainties, commitment and motivation.


Innovation and Scientific Advance
---------------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Does innovation increase or decrease the complexity and uncertainty
    in society?

-   What is the relationship between human innovation and the ecosystem?

-   In what ways does one innovation lead to another?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   On one level, incremental improvement of technology works: today's
    cars are far better than the cars of the 1950s, aircraft rarely
    crash, and medical procedures which would have once been highly
    dangerous are now routine and safe. Technology evolves: it becomes
    more efficient, safer and cheaper.

-   However, developments in equity, freedom, social welfare, education
    and the prevention of conflict have not been so spectacular.

-   The technological gain of increased efficiency produce systematic
    problems elsewhere: cars turns the ground to tarmac, pollutes the
    air with fumes and noise, causes congestion, results in the
    travelling of increasing distances and creates a pathological
    obsession with speed.

-   A previous generation of fast cars creates new uncertainty which
    leads to the next generation of fast cars. The search for new
    medical procedures and drugs is a reaction to the uncertainty
    produced by the previous generation of drugs and procedures. The
    creation of new ways of measuring the performance of social systems
    a reaction to the failure of existing ways of measuring social
    systems.

Computers and Science
---------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Could scientists be replaced by computers?

-   What areas of scientific investigation do not involve computers?

-   Since computers manipulate information, what is information and how
    does it relate to science?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   After the advances in physics in the 20^th^ century, computers have
    become essential tools for calculating probabilities rather than
    definite objective observations.

-   By the 1940s, computers were being used to calculate the solutions
    to the statistical equations of Boltzmann and Gibbs: theoretical
    development could be accelerated with mechanical aids to
    computation.

-   In the years to the present day, the computer has transformed
    science to the point of dominating it. The sophistication of
    statistical analysis has been exploited in crunching ever-vaster
    amounts of data (such as the human genome) producing new patterns
    and descriptions which reveal new insights.

-   Computer-generated models appear to imitate nature displaying
    predictive power in their behaviour without any underlying
    hypothesis, and results of search routines upon the vast database of
    resources on the web can easily create the impression that the world
    *is* the internet.

-   This has led to an instrumentalisation of scientific inquiry.
    Advances in machine learning, off-the-shelf software for crunching
    social science data, modelling tools from engineering to biology
    create a scientific environment where inability to control the
    available software is a greater hindrance to professional success
    than the inability to think critically about what is being
    experienced.

![image](vonneumann.jpg)


DNA and Information
-------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   If DNA contains information, what is this information the same as
    information in a computer?

-   Do enzymes and proteins also contain information? How does this
    information relate to the information in DNA?

-   How do the cells at the end of the baby's finger know they are at
    the end of the finger? Does DNA tell them that?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Nobody knows what information is: there is no coherent definition
    which unites information in DNA with information in the computer, or
    information in physics.

-   Yet the sequencing of information in DNA and genetics is now a huge
    industry. Most of this work is dominated by large-scale
    computer-driven research. There are worries that this focus on
    computer-driven research will drive out the space for thinking or
    rethinking the way in which life works. In a recent article, Amos
    argues that the computer-dominated 'big science' is something we
    should all worry about because:

    > "genome sequencing offers little science training because most of
    > the work is done by machines and technicians ... it is the
    > antithesis of good science, being largely hypothesis-free and
    > involving little experimental design. Why are we placing our few
    > remaining publicly funded eggs into proportionately fewer and
    > fewer baskets?"[@noauthor_big_2013]

-   Utopian visions for the future of science envisage the
    ever-increasing power of machine learning and Big data producing
    answers to fundamental scientific and social problems. On closer
    inspection, the results of such massive computation, such as the
    analysis of genetic samples, or the analysis of human behaviour on
    social media, does little more than amplify the work of thousands of
    humans were they to endure the boredom of sitting around counting
    things.

![image](dnaseq.jpg)


Cellular Communication and Human Communication
----------------------------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS:**

-   Is there a relationship between the way cells talk to each other and
    the way we talk to each other

-   What is the relationship between cellular communication and physics?

-   What is the relationship between the cell and consciousness?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Cells communicate through a process whereby proteins are produced by
    DNA within the cell, and these proteins form receptors on the
    surface of the cell which connects to proteins in the environment of
    the cell, produced by other cells.

-   Cells organise themselves according to a balance between their
    internal organisation and their external environment. It is a
    process referred to in biology as 'transduction'

-   Drawn abstractly, a cell is a boundary which maintains itself
    through the balancing of communications within the boundary and
    communications outside the boundary
    ![image](cells.jpg)

-   Humans communicate similarly by organising themselves according the
    balance between the internal (psychological) environment and the
    external (social) environment.

-   If a cell communicates to maintain its boundary, do humans
    communicate to maintain their identity?

-   The extent to which human communication is an identity-preserving
    activity can be inspected by considering those things which most
    people do *not* want communicated (for example, secrets, things
    which reveal what we really think, but do not want to be known, etc)


Origin of Language - The 'Symbol Grounding Problem'
---------------------------------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   How can something as complex as human language emerge from something
    simple?

-   What hope is there for Artificial Intelligence if the complexity of
    language cannot be reproduced or explained?

-   When we say human language is 'complex', what do we mean?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   In the theory of information, the symbol grounding problem refers to
    the inability to account for the emergence of signs and tokens
    (words) with referents from basic principles without recourse to
    apriori distinctions.

-   The description of abstract mechanisms which show how structures of
    data can emerge and form the basis of very simple languages has been
    elusive, although there have been some interesting attempts by
    Holland (see his 'echo' model) and Floridi.
    ![image](symbolgrounding.jpg)

-   The symbol grounding problem is fundamentally a problem within the
    broader topic of morphogenesis, and indeed, the emergence of
    discrete symbols from basic principles is not dissimilar from the
    emergence of discrete forms from basic principles. They might well
    be one and the same!

-   Complexity itself is not well-understood. Human language has lots of
    variety - many words for many things. But human language also
    exhibits rich patterns, which appear to be overlaid over one
    another - like poetry.


Human Emotion and Behaviour
---------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS:**

-   What is an emotion? How does it relate to a thought?

-   Why do certain things like music, football and grief give rise to
    such strong emotions?

-   Will machines ever experience emotions?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Emotions on listening to a piece of music, or emotions in watching a
    movie, or grieving after the death of a loved one are powerful
    whole-body sensations.

-   Emotions do not appear to be merely in the brain.

-   There appear to be connections between the waves of emotion that
    moves through a person on hearing a music, grieving for the death of
    a loved one, gazing into a lover's eyes, cheering at a football
    match, and so on.

-   Each effect, as a change to the state of a person, will have a
    consequent experience associated with it, and each state will
    therefore tend to move to another state. In moments of intense
    emotional experience, like bursting into tears, the physical effects
    of this rushing through us have real physical side-effects.

-   Phenomena like music are very important in understanding emotion.
    Recent research on 'communicative musicality' is examining the
    emotional and musical relationships between mothers and babies, for
    example [@malloch_communicative_2010]

-   In listening to music, emotion appears to be related to the problem
    of expectation[@huron_sweet_2008]. This is to say my expectations
    are normatively constructed, then the degree to which they might
    deviate from normal conditions may be an index of emotion.

![image](commus.jpg)


Ecology and Evolution
---------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS:**

-   Where have evolutionary processes actually been *observed*?

-   What is the difference between Darwinian evolution and creationism?

-   Do animals inherit the habits of their parents in their genes?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Bateson argues that "today it is quite obvious that [the organism]
    is not the unit of survival in the freal biological world. The unit
    of survival is organism plus environment. We are learning by bitter
    experience that the organism which destroys its environment destroys
    itself."

-   If the unit of survival of an organism is 'organism + environment',
    how are we to understand the environment?

-   Human development, if it is done in ignorance of the environment -
    whether it is ecological, political, economic, etc, is going to lead
    to disaster.

-   Bateson argues that "the unit of evolutionary survival turns out to
    be identical with the unit of mind."

    > "Ecology, in the widest sense, turns out to be the study of the
    > interaction and survival of ideas and programs (i.e., differences,
    > complexes of differences, etc.) in circuits."

-   If we make the error of taking the wrong unit "you end up with the
    species versus the other species around it or versus the environment
    in which it operates. Man against nature. You end up, in fact, with
    Kaneohe Bay polluted, Lake Erie a slimy green mess, and "Let's
    build bigger atom bombs to kill off the next-door
    neighbors."[@bateson_steps_1987]


Inheritance: Lamarck and Darwin
-------------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   How did the elephant get its trunk and the giraffe get its neck?

-   Do we inherit the habits of our ancestors through our genes?

-   Is the 'survival of the fittest' the mechanism whereby nature
    evolves?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Darwin has affected us hugely well outside the realm of biology.
    From evolutionary economics to Marxist theory, anthropology, physics
    and genetics, each has been touched by the Darwinian mindset.

-   Bateson argues that Lamarck's basic idea of the 'inheritance of
    acquired characteristics', whilst being on the surface wrong, was
    the first to consider the question of 'mind' from first principles,
    using 'habit' as one of his axioms. Mind was emergent from habit
    [@bateson_steps_1987] ![image](darwinlamarck.jpg)

-   Bateson further argues that Darwin's mechanism, for all its genius,
    took "mind" out of the equation in the question of survival and
    replaced it with a process of natural selection.

-   Recent biological work suggests that Lamarck may have been at least
    partly right: for example, inheritance of predisposition to asthma
    correlating with the grandparents' smoking. Cellular mechanisms of
    adaptation may be behind surprising patterns of inheritance which go
    beyond natural selection.


Information
-----------

**KEY QUESTIONS:**

-   What is information?

-   What is the relationship between information and meaning?

-   What is it to be 'in-formed'?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   One of the biggest arguments in science today is about the nature of
    information.

-   This course is made up of information: it is the background of
    education. Formal education systems enlist mechanisms for codifying
    the knowledge and skills of individuals into information.

-   There is information on the computer screen that you might be
    staring at reading this. Information is analysed, and the analysis
    produces more information.

-   Biologists analyse the information in DNA, and physicists look for
    the information in Black Holes.
    ![image](synergetics.jpg)

-   Information has a measurement developed by Claude Shannon, without
    whose equations, the internet would not work. In Shannon's work,
    Information is equivalent to 'uncertainty'.

-   Information is used to make decisions. We are told with better
    information, we make better decisions. More and more effort is put
    into generating more and more information.

-   If we don't understand information, what do we mean by meaning?


Paradigm Shifts and Analysis
----------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   How do we know we do research right?

-   What happens when a new discovery turns everything we know
    upside-down (for example, Copernicus or Einstein)?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Scientific history is full of stories where science was turned
    upside down. Thomas Kuhn calls these moments a 'paradigm shift'
    [@kuhn_structure_1996].

-   Such moments are the result of an analytical approach to science,
    where fundamental generating mechanisms for the world being the way
    it is are reconsidered from the bottom up.
    ![image](duck-rabbit.jpg)

-   Most research in almost all fields in universities is not analytic
    like this, and analytic work is often difficult to get published.

-   Most research work is instead synthetic: an approach to research
    which gathers evidence from a variety of empirical situations and
    attempts to fit an explanatory framework over the perceived
    phenomena.

-   Paul Feyerabend argued that the adherence to ways of researching and
    theories of science which were obviously not right had to do with
    irrational human processes of defending egos and reputations of
    scientists and the status of institutions[@feyerabend_against_2010].
    He argued that no theory of science should exclude these factors,
    and that only by acknowledging it would a deeper awareness of the
    social process of science be possible.


Cosmological Thinking
---------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS:**

-   Should we think about the details of particular phenomena, or should
    we think about how the whole universe gives rise to particular
    phenomena?

-   How can a cosmology be verified?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   The result of analytical thinking is a deeper cosmology about why
    the universe is the way it is

-   Such cosmologies characterise the work of scientific revolutionaries
    like Newton, Galileo, Einstein. In each case, they radically rethink
    the story of the universe.

-   In order to comprehend what underlying mechanisms are, one has to
    see *beyond* what is immediately perceived.

-   Synthetic approaches to science, rather than analytical approaches,
    dominate most of what goes by the name of 'research' in
    universities: in physics, a unified theory has been the goal for
    many generations of physicists who have attempted to unify quantum
    mechanics with relativity and Newtonian mechanics: so far the
    approach has failed. In biology, synthesis leads to the variety of
    specialised theories of epigenesis and genetics.

-   As with physics, nothing coherent has yet emerged, and indeed there
    is no explanation for the ways in which cells organise to produce
    hearts, brains and fingers. In medicine, synthetic methods gather
    evidence of 'markers' for disease from genetics, neurology,
    endocrinology, and so on, and then seeks to explain disease through
    the presence of markers.

-   It should not therefore surprise us to know that research efforts
    into learning and education (of which biological, physical and
    physiological theories are a subset) lack coherence and explanatory
    power.


Intersubjectivity
=================

Consciousness
-------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   How can consciousness talk about consciousness? How can a brain
    describe a brain?

-   How could the presence of a mind-independent reality be proved?

-   Is our mind in our head? Where else might it be?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   The founder of phenomenology, Edmund Husserl, realised that in order
    to study consciousness it was impossible to escape the problem that
    whatever an *individual* consciousness was (and the very idea of
    *individual* is problematic) the consciousness of one mind was
    *relative* to another.

-   Husserl considered the idea of consciousness *between* people, or
    what he called *intersubjectivity*. He argued that consciousness
    emerged between minds in a shared environment, or 'lifeworld'.

-   Husserl was primarily focused on the structure of consciousness and
    his idea of intersubjectivity was framed around the face-to-face
    interaction between two people. Broader relations to society,
    contemporaries and ancestors were not considered.

-   However, consciousness is between people face-to-face, and between
    people who are not with us immediately, with material objects in the
    world (like computers), and maybe even between the minds of the
    living and the minds of dead (how could we know?)

-   Often neuroscience identifies the mind inside the head: in doing so,
    it presupposes an objective world of 'mind' beyond the mind that
    makes the observation through MRI scanners!


Consciousness and Intersubjectivity
-----------------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Is consciousness in between people analyzable?

-   How conscious are you now?

-   What are the observable features of consciousness?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Alfred Schutz made a connection between Husserl's intersubjectivity
    and Weber's sociology. Weber, in defining sociology as "a science
    concerning itself with the interpretive understanding of social
    action and thereby with a causal explanation of its course and
    consequences" [@weber_economy_1978] lacked a theory of human
    understanding, and didn't go into much detail about the ways in
    which human communication occurs.

-   Schutz saw Husserl's attempt to describe intersubjectivity as a
    corrective to this: a comprehensive theory of mind that could be
    united with a theory of social life. However, Schutz felt that
    Husserl's account of intersubjectivity was deficient since Husserl's
    main focus in considering intersubjectivity is one-to-one close
    relations, and ignores the broader dimension of what Schutz called
    the "world of others".

-   world of others, according to Schutz, involves a range of different
    kinds of intersubjective relations, from intimate face-to-face
    relations, to distance relations with 'contemporaries'.

-   The online world presents a clear distinction between face-to-face
    engagement and more distant relations. Schutz himself distinguished
    between between face-to-face engagement, or what he called a "pure
    we-relation", and engagement at a distance. He identified what he
    called a 'spectrum of vividness', arguing that the difference
    between the face-to-face world and what he calls the "world of
    contemporaries" can be illustrated by the experience of ending a
    face-to-face encounter:


Communication and Expectation
-----------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Can you communicate with someone if you have no idea of what they
    think?

-   When you email somebody, who are you talking to?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   The sociologist Talcott Parsons sought to develop Schutz's ideas
    about expectation into a more systematic theory of human
    communication, arguing that what happens in communication was a
    process of what he calls '*double
    contingency*'[@parsons_social_2012]. $A$'s expectations of $B$'s
    behaviour in response to $A$'s utterances are mirrored by $B$'s
    expectations of $A$ behaviour to $B$'s utterances. In an extended
    correspondence between them, Parsons and Schutz wrestle between a
    systematic and systems-theoretical characterisation of communication
    (which was what Parsons sought) and a phenomenological and more
    subtle characterisation of the development of consciousness in
    communication (which Schutz was aiming for) [@grathoff_theory_1978].

-   What Schutz refers to as a "decreasing number of perceptions"
    suggests that each of the sensory 'channels' which carry alternative
    descriptions of the encounter are degraded with distance. What is
    constructed from these multiple descriptions is, Schutz suggests (in
    line with Husserl), a set of expectations about the communication
    situation without which the making of utterances would be
    impossible. In other words, I can only write these words now because
    I have some expectation of the experience of you as a reader.

-   The meaning of my words is therefore dependent on the coordination
    of expectations between people who communicate: Husserl called these
    sets of expectations 'horizons of meaning', and so it can be said
    that what is communicated are not words but expectations or
    meanings.

-   Schutz does not suggest that the process of 'coordinating
    expectations' does *not* happen at a distance, but he does suggest
    that the mechanisms by which meanings are established and
    coordinated between people are different in the situation where
    there is face-to-face contact, and where there is no physical
    co-presence.

-   Schutz's analysis presents some fascinating questions: might he say
    that a 'pure we-relation' is still possible at a distance using a
    medium of communication (say Skype) which does not decrease the
    number of perceptions?

    ![Double Contingency as conceived by Parsons as the dialogue between
    'ego' and 'alter'](doublecont){width="columnwidth"}


Dialogue and Listening
----------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   What happens when we listen somebody carefully?

-   After listening, how do we formulate a response?

-   Can we teach people to listen better?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Dialogue involves listening to a greater extent than it does talking

-   In dialogue there is not necessarily a free choice of talking: what
    is said is said in the context of what is understood by what is
    heard by others.

-   Dialogue articulates a structure which has many levels: a
    conversations about an object produces a conversation about the
    conversation about the object, or a conversation about the
    conversation about the conversation about an object. These different
    levels of discourse shift over time. What emerges are different
    discrete strata of construction.

-   David Bohm believed that at its best, dialogue reflected deeper
    structures in the universe. The multiple strata of patterns of
    engagement in dialogue help us to perceive something deeper.

-   Objects can help with the process of dialogue. When an object is
    presented (for example a photograph), it invites many different
    descriptions from different people. When these descriptions are
    brought together, it produces a richer picture not just of the
    object, but of the different people who makes descriptions about it.

-   Teachers are particularly skilled in generating multiple
    descriptions of the same thing. The process of teaching is a process
    of generating redundancy: the teacher may say "think about it like
    this", or "here's an example", or "let me tell you a story about
    this", or "What do you think?" (which is an invitation to multiple
    descriptions produced by others.

-   Encouraging people to listen requires encouraging people to see the
    importance of multiple descriptions of things rather than being
    focused on a single 'correct' description. Science is partly to
    blame for presenting the world in a single description. Modern
    physics actually tells us that this isn't how things are.


Unhappiness
-----------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   How do childhood relationships with parents affect us in adult life?

-   What is the relation between ourselves and our environment which
    makes us unhappy?

-   What are the factors which help alleviate unhappiness?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Unhappiness may have a systemic explanation. In the study of animal
    behaviour, it became clear that the relationship between mothers and
    babies was a systemic relation. If mothers were separated from
    babies, then the result was distress.

-   Konrad Lorenz, who was the pioneer of this work, projected his
    findings on to the human world:

    > The competition between human beings destroys with cold and
    > diabolic brutality... Under the pressure of this competitive fury
    > we have not only forgotten what is useful to humanity as a whole,
    > but even that which is good and advantageous to the individual.
    > [...] One asks, which is more damaging to modern humanity: the
    > thirst for money or consuming haste... in either case, fear plays
    > a very important role: the fear of being overtaken by one's
    > competitors, the fear of becoming poor, the fear of making wrong
    > decisions or the fear of not being up to snuff...
    > [@lorenz_aggression_2002]

-   In Lorenz's work with geese, he noticed how the movement of chicks
    maintained proximity to the mother. He called this mechanism of
    maintaining proximity 'imprinting' and explored its parameters by
    replacing real mothers with a wire-frame model which was presented
    to the chicks within hours of hatching: as a consequence, the baby
    chicks maintained proximity to this object as if it was the mother.
    It was a cybernetic experiment where theoretical models and
    empirical evidence combined convincingly.

-   Does this suggest that emotions such as unhappiness, grief, anger
    have their roots in the systemic relation between the child and the
    parent? More broadly, it may suggest that the relationship between
    the organism and the environment is the critical determiner of
    emotion.

-   If this is the case, then it suggests that issues of experience of
    emotion have a connection to political issues in the social
    environment: what R.D. Laing calls the 'Politics of Experience'
    [@laing_politics_1990]

 
Attachment: The roots of emotion in childhood
---------------------------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   What is the child's tie to its mother as a systemic relation?

-   Why does disruption to the child's relationship with its mother lead
    to psychological trauma later in life?

-   Can deep emotional issues be understood in terms of abstract
    systems?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   John Bowlby stated that " the child's tie to his mother is a product
    of the activity of a number of behavioural systems that have
    proximity to mother as a predictable outcome."

-   He suggested that "young children, who for whatever reason are
    deprived of the continuous care and attention of a mother or a
    substitute-mother, are not only temporarily disturbed by such
    deprivation, but may in some cases suffer long-term effects which
    persist" [@bowlby_effects_1956]

-   Bowlby called his mechanism 'attachment' and expressed it in
    cybernetic terms: "What principles of organisation are necessary if
    behaviour is to attain these ends?". In stating his organisational
    principle, Bowlby sets the stage for an analysis of personality
    arising from mechanisms of early life relations and the
    organisational dynamics of development. He focused particularly on
    the relationship between the child and the mother - although the
    issue is really about the principal caregiver of whichever sex.

-   The demonstration of the thesis demanded attention on what happened
    if the proximity to the mother is *not* a predictable outcome. What
    happened where the mother or father rejected the child's affection,
    or attachments were affected by death or drastic changes in
    circumstance? In exploring this, Bowlby turns to some of the
    fundamental problems of psychoanalysis.

-   The consequence of this view was that human behaviour had to be
    studied *relationally*. Humans were not individuals, but
    inter-connected systems: recent research work of addiction supports
    his findings. [@flores_addiction_2011].


Facilitating Learning
---------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   How do you become a facilitator of discussion rather than a
    possessor of knowledge?

-   What is Personal Intellectual Transformation?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   During the communicative process, complex theoretical problems are
    put forward and solved, scientific material is analyzed, the
    positions of various scientific schools are compared, disputable
    points are identified and clarified.

-   The communication between students and the teacher makes it possible
    to build scientific information in a single harmonious system, to
    highlight the main points in it, to reveal the position in the proof
    analysis, and to help students to critically comprehend the proposed
    factual material, to realize and evaluate it, highlighting the most
    necessary and discarding the secondary.

-   The content of communication is information that the teacher offers
    students through various communication tools. However, the essence
    of communication is not limited to information exchange. To ensure
    that the content of the discipline has been assimilated by students
    at a high level, it is necessary, along with pedagogical tasks, to
    set and solve communicative tasks.

-   In teaching, we choose the most effective methods of communication
    and on their basis to organize productive communication between the
    teacher and the student.

-   Successful communication is facilitated by the use of information
    products and pedagogical technologies aimed at activating students'
    thinking. Typically, experienced teachers intuitively use in their
    work a synthesis of elements of creative learning.

-   To encourage students to think, documenting experiences and
    reflections helps to expand the field of inquiry through the
    consistent formulation of the set of questions "Why?" (Similar to
    curiosity in childhood), and helps to identify cause and effect
    relationships, helping to better understand the subject of research
    and plunge into the research problem.


Risk and Anxiety
----------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   What are you worried about?

-   Do we worry about more things than our parents did?

-   Do technological advances create more things to worry about?

-   Is anxiety evenly distributed in society?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   German Sociologist Ulrich Beck argued that we now live in a 'risk
    society', where risks are manufactured both in the creation of new
    technologies, and in the creation of new risks in the law, the
    economy, and education.

-   Beck argues that the distribution of risks is not even: those at the
    bottom of society are subject to far more risks, with far fewer
    means of addressing them, than those at the top.

-   He argues that there is a connection between risk and education:
    that new technologies create new requirements to learn to use new
    tools, which increases the risk of not being qualified.

-   Furthermore, Beck argues that education itself becomes a risk:

    > "Everywhere educational reform is accompanied by a dependence on
    > education. More and more groups get caught up in the race for
    > educational credentials. As a result there emerge new internal
    > differentiations. Whilst these may still respond to traditional
    > differences between groups, the impact of education makes them
    > fundamentally different from traditional ones. [...] In
    > conjunction with novel patterns of upward and downward mobility
    > and increasing local labour mobility as well, new hierarchies and
    > differentiations develop which are internal to social classes.
    > They presuppose the expansion of the service sector and the
    > creation of new occupations."[@beck_risk_1992]

![image](beck.jpg)

 
Constructs
----------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Are the words you use to describe the world the same as the words
    others use to describe the world?

-   Do you mean the same things by the words you use as others do when
    they use the same words?

-   Do the words we use to describe the world reveal how the world is,
    or how we are?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   We use words to describe our reality, and reality appears
    differently to each of us.

-   Whilst this doesn't mean that reality *is* simply language, it does
    emphasise that the words we use form an important part of the fabric
    of the world through which we have to find our way.

-   Finding our way in the world is not something we do alone: we have
    to communicate with other people. That means that we have to
    coordinate our understandings of the words we use with the
    understandings of words by others.

-   George Kelly's 'Personal Construct Theory' is an approach to
    analysing the different ways individuals construct their reality by
    analysing the different words they use in different circumstances.

-   For example, if I was to classify 'cakes', I might think of a
    variety of ways of describing and categorising them, including
    "sweet", "fluffy", "heavy", "fruity", and so on.

-   The way I use those words may differ from the way other people might
    use them: so, given a set of cakes, how I categorise them may be
    different to how others categorise them.

-   The value of doing Personal Construct analysis is it opens up a
    broader conversation about where distinctions really lie, and how
    different people with different distinctions can coordinate
    themselves.

Interdisciplinarity
===================

What are you studying?
----------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Where is the boundary between the subject you are studying and other
    subjects?

-   Are subjects in university real things - do they actually exist in
    the jobs people do in the world?

-   If all the theory you are taught was actually true, how different
    would the world look to the way it actually does?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Each of you is a student studying a subject in the 'School of
    economics and management'. What is 'economics'? What is
    'management'? There are no clear answers to these questions. All
    that can be said is that they are 'topics of discussion'. So is that
    all a 'subject' is?... a topic of discussion?

-   But how much discussion about your subject do you really do in
    university? In University, subjects are divided into 'topics', and
    assessments are set around those topics. All of a sudden, you are
    not able to ask what the big 'subject' is, because you have small
    tasks to complete otherwise you will fail your course! And asking
    too many difficult questions can get very disruptive!

-   And we are all told that we study the subjects we do because it will
    help us get jobs. Does it really? Where in the real world is there a
    'topic' of 'economics'? Of course, people buy and sell things,
    create businesses, and so on. But nobody fully understands this
    basic human behaviour.



The Discipline of Education
---------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Why is education often boring?

-   Is education a subject?

-   What is education for?

-   Do you need to come to university when you can learn so much online?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   There is much confusion about what education is and there is no
    coherent theory of it.

-   Education may be often boring because we have a bad theory of
    education. If we had a better theory, then learning would perhaps be
    more in tune with the way that human consciousness works.

-   Boredom itself is a reaction to a kind of oppression.

-   The topic of education itself is not of the same kind as the topics
    of physics, maths or chemistry. Sociologist Everett Hughes argued
    that education was not a discipline but rather "a major complex of
    arts". He explains that it is not a discipline:

    > "in the sense of offering a single order of phenomena which, when
    > observed and/or manipulated in a systematic way, yield a body of
    > consistent theory. In this respect, education is like the other
    > great practical arts - looking after the sick, keeping order, and
    > distributing justice. All of them, however, give rise to a variety
    > of disciplines and, in turn, use many of their results. These arts
    > are the very springs of human curiosity; they are also great
    > consumers of man's best intellectual and scientific efforts. None
    > of these arts, moreover, is ever completely under the control of
    > the human will, the will of one man or of some small group of men,
    > or even of society at large through its instruments. Yet control
    > over these arts is sought in all societies. The manner of
    > practicing them is the very stuff of the clash of wills and
    > interests; thus, the stuff of
    > politics."[@hughes_sociological_1985]

-   Hughes's distinction between a 'discipline' and a 'complex of arts'
    is helpful in the sense that it causes us to ask whether there is a
    'body of consistent theory' about education

-   In education, what is accepted as 'theory' is often an amalgamation
    of ideas drawn from different sources and used in a rhetorical way
    to defend particular interventions or practices.


Distinctions
------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   What is a distinction?

-   How is one distinction related to another?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Drawing a distinction between one thing and another is always the
    first (and essential) step in being able to study something.
    Distinctions are made about biological species, artistic forms,
    philosophical positions, times of day, colours, or sounds and
    movements. Education feeds on distinctions. To study education is to
    study the way distinctions are made and the dynamics of their
    interaction.

-   A distinction is a boundary. It constrains one set of things as
    belonging to one group, and another set of things as belonging to a
    different group. In making a distinction about red butterflies, a
    line is drawn and criteria established to identify whether a
    particular object belongs on the side of the line which says 'red
    butterflies' and everything else not a red butterfly. The red
    butterfly distinction is marked by constraining what does not meet
    the criteria (other distinctions) for a red butterfly. A distinction
    is a *choice* of a constraint. The choosing, however, is itself
    constrained by other things: for example, norms, values,
    institutions, education and individual expectations.

-   Every distinction exists within distinctions at a different level.
    We might make the distinction about butterflies, but where are the
    distinctions made about the scientific or aesthetic norms, values
    and expectations within which the butterfly distinction is made? To
    explore distinction-making as a process, we have to become aware of
    both sides of the distinction in order to see the complex structures
    of hierarchies which might be at work in establishing even the
    simplest judgements about reality.

-   In education we draw a distinction much like the distinction which
    Hughes tries to draw. If we want to say education is $x$, $y$ or
    $z$, then a distinction is drawn with $x$, $y$ or $z$ in a box, and
    everything that isn't $x$ outside the $x$ box Then we can say that
    everything outside $x$ constrains the definition of $x$.
    Distinctions become *drawable*.

-   In a simple way, Hughes distinction between Education as a complex
    of arts and what he calls 'disciplines' can be drawn as in Figure
    [[fig:educationconstraint]](#fig:educationconstraint){reference-type="ref"
    reference="fig:educationconstraint"}.

    ![Hughes's defininition of education within uncertain
    constraints[]{label="fig:educationconstraint"}](noteducation){#fig:educationconstraint
    width="columnwidth"}

-   Drawing it like this immediately raises questions. The arrows
    between the disciplines in the diagram show a relationship which is
    not clear in Hughes's description. *Maths* and *Physics* have a
    relation to *education*. Education shapes what they are: so
    shouldn't they be *within* the education box? But also Maths and
    physics have a relationship to each other: mathematical techniques
    like calculus derived from new theories in physics and astronomical
    observations. So this diagram isn't very satisfactory - but the lack
    of clarity in Hughes's description becomes apparent through trying
    to draw it as a diagram.


Transduction: The process of upholding a distinction
----------------------------------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS:**

-   What is the process that converts an analogue signal to digital?

-   What is the process that maintains a boundary between something?

-   If a boundary between one thing and another changes, what happens to
    other boundaries?

-   How does society change over time?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   If there are many possible distinctions about 'maths', 'education',
    'hospitals' or 'chairs' how it is that we maintain relatively stable
    distinctions in society? There must be a process which is
    responsible for maintaining a coherent and agreed set of
    distinctions around which we coordinate our social lives, our
    education system, our scientific practice, and so on. Cybernetics
    gives a name name to the process of maintaining a distinction: it is
    *transduction*.

-   In engineering, transduction is the process of taking one form of
    energy and turning it into another - like an electric transformer or
    a heat exchanger. In those examples, and in every other example of
    transduction, what results is a boundary - or a distinction.

-   The transduction process works on both sides of a distinction. By
    recognising that distinctions are maintained by a process is to
    recognise that the process may change - and a change to the
    distinction-making process at one level can lead to changes in the
    distinction-making process at many other levels too. To change a
    social system - or indeed any system - we have to 'tweak the
    transducers'!

-   All distinctions are the result of transduction processes.

-   Societies change when their distinctions about themselves change,
    and this changes when the structure of their transductions change.


Inside and Outside in economics
-------------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   What are the internal economic considerations that businesses must
    consider?

-   What are the external considerations that businesses must consider?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Strengthening the economic potential of the enterprise is impossible
    without improving the planning process, reflecting the process of
    implementation of innovations. These are internal processes.

-   The role of the target quantitative criterion in this case can be
    performed by an indicator of investment activity (the result of cash
    flow). It is also important to balance the amounts of positive and
    negative cash flows, analyze the relationship between the cash flow
    balance of current operations and net profit (loss).

-   The dynamics of changes in profit should correspond to the change in
    the balanced cash flows from the current activity. To maximize
    profits, it is necessary to minimize material costs and ensure the
    growth of labor productivity by reducing the labor intensity of
    products and works based on innovations.

-   The financial strategy of the company should be developed taking
    into account the risk of non-payments, inflation spikes and other
    force majeure circumstances.

-   Financial control is necessary for the timely identification of
    internal reserves, improving the profitability of the economy,
    increasing cash savings in the enterprise. Many of these require a
    consideration of external factors.

-   The use of an integrated automated management system for the
    formation of financial statements at the enterprise will allow
    processing the information base and regularly receive an operative
    report on its financial status of the company, will become a tool
    for diagnosis and continuous monitoring of the financial situation.

-   The use of modern information technologies will ensure the accuracy
    and coherence of actions of all employees, including those involved
    in the management process, the strengthening of internal financial
    control in the enterprise, the aggregation of information based on
    the processing of indicators of different levels of planning.

-   As a result, adequate and timely risk assessment will be possible,
    minimization of costs and effective operation of the enterprise in
    order to strengthen its economic potential in the face of uncertain
    market conditions.


Inside and Outside in Tourism
-----------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   What might 'inside' and 'outside' refer to in tourism?

-   what is the function of a tourism company in maintaining the
    relations between the 'inside' and 'outside' among its customers and
    suppliers?

-   What is leisure or recreation?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Tourism intertwines culture, economics, ecology and management

-   Tourist resources are divided into cultural, natural, socio-cultural
    sites. It should be noted that it was cultural factors /culture that
    acted and acted as a driver of tourism development.

-   In the era of globalization, tourism acts as a link in the
    intercultural development and mutual understanding between peoples.

-   Tourism as a sphere of recreation is in interrelation with the
    environment. Recreational areas are very fragile, vulnerable,
    resources are exhausted.

-   Sometimes spontaneous, uncontrolled development of tourism creates a
    number of environmental problems: the destruction of natural
    landscapes, the modification of components of the natural
    environment, etc.

-   Accordingly, the formation of environmental awareness among tourism
    professionals, the understanding of related scientific branches
    necessary.

-   As a sphere of the economy, tourism is an active source of
    replenishment of the revenue side of budgets of different levels,
    has a multiplying effect on related industries.

-   In the tourist professional activity the leading role is occupied by
    management. Management in the field of tourism has a specific
    nature, because a tourist product is, first of all, a service
    product that requires a system approach to management, which is
    oriented to the development of the human resource of the enterprise
    and is "sharpened" for the interests of the client.


Meta-Language
-------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   When do you talk about the way you talk?

-   Why might it be useful to have an agreed way of talking about
    talking?

-   How is a language about systems useful?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   What has been described as a process of upholding sets of
    distinctions has a more formal description in cybernetics developed
    by Stafford Beer.

-   Beer understood that the fundamental problems of institutions
    concerned how they made distinctions about themselves: the Viable
    System Model presented a kind of template upon which institutions
    and businesses could project their current operations and speculate
    on new ways of organising themselves.

-   Beer worked in Chile in 1971, to work with Salvadore Allende on the
    establishment of a technologically-driven socialist state.

-   The distinction between an organism and its environment is
    maintained through a process of attenuation of the environment by
    the organism, and the amplification of organism's attenuations
    through the production of multiple descriptions of it. Any organism
    must somehow coordinate which parts of its operations to attenuate
    the environment. This means that as part of the organism there must
    be a higher-level function which examines the function of the
    organism's operations and attempts to coordinate them.


Organism and Environment
------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   What is the relationship between an organism and its environment?

-   How does an organism adapt to survive in its environment?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

![Coordination between environment (E) of Variety $V_M$, organism (O) of
Variety $V_O$ and organism metasystem (M) of Variety
$V_M$[]{label="ref:basictransduction"}](Varietymgmt1){#ref:basictransduction
width="columnwidth"}

-   Organisms are complex systems, but their environment is more
    complex. Their complexity can be considered as *variety* and
    represented as $V_O$, while the complexity of the environment is
    $V_E$

-   To survive in an environment, the organism has first to attenuate
    the complexity of the environment, and amplify its own complexity.

-   However, if the organism simply reacted to the environment, it would
    not be able to develop. It also needs a meta-system which is able to
    steer the adaptations of the organism by observing how the organism
    adapts.


Recursion
---------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Why do patterns contain patterns which contain patterns?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   ![Recursive
    transductions[]{label="recursive"}](recursivevariety){#recursive
    width="columnwidth"}

-   Each level of transduction produces an attenuation of the level
    below it. Each level of transduction presents multiple descriptions
    of itself to the level above. The central issue here is that the
    attenuations are by necessity always approximations.

-   Each level engages directly with the level below by presenting
    multiple descriptions of the attenuation that it produces. This
    process of producing multiple descriptions of attenuation might be
    thought of as 'amplification'.

-   The result of the combined process of amplification and attenuation
    is that there is *error* between the multiple descriptions of the
    world as it is and the attenuated descriptions of it. The central
    issue is what to do about the error.

-   Errors are manifested in the multiplicity of descriptions that each
    level presents to the level above. These multiple descriptions are
    similarly attenuated and amplified, and similarly produce error at
    the next level. And so it goes on.


Amplification and Attenuation in Organisational Structure
---------------------------------------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Why are hierarchies a bad idea in an uncertain environment?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   All hierarchies work on the principle of attenuation: attenuation
    from the environment to the system, and attenuation from bottom to
    top.

-   The boss cannot absorb information about the detail about what is
    happening in the environment or on the ground: they have to work
    with an abstract representation of reality.

-   In a highly uncertain and complex environment, this means that a
    hierarchy is not able to absorb the complexity of its environment or
    its operation, and so its self-adaptation does not work effectively.
    Instead, the instinct of hierarchies is to defend themselves by
    becoming more authoritarian.

    ![Two dimensions of attenuation in the organisation: From bottom to
    top (vertical), and from the environment to the individual
    (horizontal)](Slide2){width="columnwidth"}

-   There exist approaches to organisation which avoid the problems of
    hierarchy. Whilst attenuation is necessary for any system to manage
    any other system of greater complexity than itself, recursive
    distinction-making can create a dynamically adaptive system whose
    operations in its environment are continually adapted according to
    the difference between the attenuations and the actual behaviour of
    the environment.

-   Whilst recursion is the key to effective adaptive behaviour and each
    level of transduction has the same structure as every other, each
    level of recursion attenuates and amplifies different differences.
    Because of this, recursive transduction structures lead to what can
    be identified as differences in *function* at different levels of
    recursion.

-   This second point is important when considering educational
    institutions. The environment of teachers is different from the
    environment of learners, or the environment of the institution's
    accountants, or its managers. Each functional unit makes different
    attenuations and amplifications based on the information presented
    to it by lower levels, and presents different information to high
    levels of transduction.

![Multiple levels of recursive transduction within a connected
environment](attenuate1){width="columnwidth"}


Anticipatory Systems
--------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   What is anticipation?

-   How does a system construct a model of itself?

-   How is anticipation connected to consciousness?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Living systems anticipate changes in their environment. If they did
    not do this, they would be unable to react to threats.

-   Biologists including Robert Rosen [@rosen_anticipatory_2012] and
    mathematicians including Daniel Dubois [@dubois_computing_1998] have
    studied the phenomena which described a complex dynamic system
    whereby what is anticipated depends on a simultaneous processing of:

    1.  what has happened in the past

    2.  a model of what is happening

    3.  speculation on possible models of what might be happening, and
        what might be possible.

-   Dubois has elaborated this process using three simple equations
    equations showing how the dynamic interaction between what he calls
    a 'recursive' equation $(1)$, an 'incursive' equation $(2)$ and a
    'hyperincursive' equation $(3)$ produces an interference pattern
    which displays self-similarity at recursive levels
    [@dubois_computing_1998]. ![image](dubois2.jpg)


-   Consciousness may operate according to these principles making us
    'reflexive systems'. Such a system as a 'conscious' system would
    continually and simultaneously be processing what is happening
    around us (1), thinking about why what is happening is happening
    (2), and considering and evaluating alternative explanations for why
    things are happening, and what might happen next (3).


Fractals and Symmetry
---------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   What is the connection between living processes and mathematical
    processes which produce patterns that look like living things?

-   Is nature mathematical?

-   Is nature symmetrical?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   A fractal is a pattern which displays similarity in its structure at
    different levels. Common fractals include the Mandelbrot set and the
    Julia set.

-   Fractals look like living systems, and many living systems like fir
    cones, fern leaves, and sea shells display fractal patterns.

-   Danield Dubois's mathematics of anticipatory systems produce
    self-similar structures which also look like fractals

-   The common factor between these different patterns is a symmetry at
    different levels. Equally, symmetry, or rather broken symmetry
    underpins current theories of the emergence of structure in the
    universe ![image](fractal.jpg)

-   In physics, the structure of matter at the most basic level is
    suggested as being the result of a symmetry-breaking process

-   There appears to be a connection between symmetry-breaking of
    physics and the symmetry breaking of biology has been made by both
    biologists, physicists and mathematicians.

-   Some, including David Bohm and Karl Pribram [@bohm_wholeness_2002]
    have even suggested that symmetry-breaking processes are the common
    link that connected physics to biology to consciousness


Creativity in Education
-----------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   What are the advantages of the developed creative thinking?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Creativity:

    -   changes attitudes towards life

    -   allows you to give up passive attitude towards it

    -   enables you to become the force that causes change and shapes
        your future

    -   provides quick thinking and flexibility of thinking;

    -   promotes the breadth of thinking, knowledge, applied methods,
        because at the decision of various problems you do not focus
        only on one moment and a way of the decision;

    -   reduces the time and material costs necessary to solve the
        problem; allows you to know the harmony in yourself and in the
        world around you;

    -   enriches the inner and outer world of man;

    -   teaches to be in the present and simultaneously know and feel
        the past and the future; provides internal growth;

    -   fills life with joy, meaning, purpose; makes life bright,
        creative;

    -   creativity can not be insipid, indifferent, nihilistic;

    -   helps to be more calm and persistent in solving problems;

    -   increases your confidence in the correctness of your ideas;

    -   helps to better understand the thoughts of other people and,
        therefore, it is better to navigate in the world of people;

    -   helps to distract from stereotypes in thinking;

    -   increases the pleasure that you receive from solving problems,
        the so-called "creative satisfaction".


Systems and Complexity
----------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS:**

-   How do different subjects relate to one another?

-   What is complexity?

-   What is simplicity?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   At this point we must be clear about how a 'system' is to be
    defined. Our first impulse is to point at the pendulum and to say,
    the system is that thing there. This method, however, has a
    fundamental disadvantage: every material object contains no less
    than an infinity of variables and therefore of possible systems. The
    real pendulum, for instance, has not only length and position; it
    has also mass, temperature, electric conductivity, crystalline
    structure, chemical impurities, some radioactivity, velocity,
    reflecting power, tensile strength, a surface film of moisture,
    bacterial contamination, an optical absorption, elasticity, shape,
    specific gravity and so on and on. Any suggestion that we should
    study 'all' the facts is unrealistic, and actually the attempt is
    never made. What is necessary is that we should pick out and study
    the facts that are relevant to some main interest that is already
    given ... The system now means, not a thing, but a list of
    variables. [@ashby_introduction_1956]

-   The word 'complex', as it may be applied to systems, has many
    possible meanings, and I must first make my use of it clear. There
    is no obvious or preeminent meaning, for although all would agree
    that the brain is complex and a bicycle simple, one has also to
    remember that to a butcher the brain of a sheep is simple while a
    bicycle, if studied exhaustively (as the only clue to a crime) may
    present a very great quantity of significant detail. Without further
    justification, I shall follow, in this paper, an interpretation of
    'complexity' that I have used and found suitable for about ten
    years. I shall measure the degree of 'complexity' by the quantity of
    information required to describe the vital system. To the
    neurophysiologist the brain, as a feltwork of fibers and a soup of
    enzymes, is certainly complex; and equally the transmission of a
    detailed description of it would require much time. To a butcher the
    brain is simple, for he has to distinguish it from only about thirty
    other 'meats', so not more than log2 30, i.e., about five bits, are
    involved. This method admittedly makes a system's complexity purely
    relative to a given observer; it rejects the attempt to measure an
    absolute, or intrinsic, complexity; but this acceptance of
    complexity as something in the eye of the beholder is, in my
    opinion, the only workable way of measuring complexity. (Ashby,
    1973 - "Some peculiarities of Complex Systems", Cybernetic
    Medicine, Vol 9, no. 1)


Control
-------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Is control a good thing or a bad thing?

-   How do we know the difference between something being under control
    and something being out of control?

-   How might something out-of-control be brought under control?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Cybernetics was originally defined as '*the art and science of
    control in man and machine*'[@wiener_cybernetics:_2013]. We have
    however, spoken of conversation being a dance, and that the dance
    can either flow, or it can break down - sometimes necessitating the
    teacher to recalibrate their approach. This issue of *dancing* and
    conversation is precisely the same as the issue of *control*.
    Unfortunately however, the word 'control' has some unpleasant
    associations with coercion, a loss of free will, authoritarianism,
    and so on. Yet all of those cases are characterised by a *lack* of
    control. So we require a more precise definition of control.

-   Stafford Beer explains the cybernetic sense of control like this:
    "Control is an attribute of a system. This word is not used in the
    way in which either an office manager or a gambler might use it; it
    is used as a name for *connectiveness*."[@beer_cybernetics_1965]

-   Control can be thought of in the context of two people dancing.
    Control simply refers to the manifest *connection* between dancers
    whose moves complement each other, and who participate in a whole
    system which exhibits coherence in its behaviour. Control is evident
    in two people having a conversation in which they are both deeply
    committed and involved. It is also evident in a game of football
    between two teams, or between two people playing a game of chess.

-   Cybernetics was originally developed in the 1940s as an approach to
    studying the dynamics of mechanical control systems. Norbert
    Wiener's mechanical control problem was how to shoot incoming
    aircraft. The mechanical problem involved feedback: the incoming
    object's position and trajectory would change, and as it did, so the
    calibration of the counter-measures had to be adjusted. The incoming
    aircraft and the missile targetting system engaged in a dance.


Science and Life
----------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   How can science understand life?

-   How can art help us understand life?

-   What is science not good at describing?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   All processes occur over time. Whilst the world continually moves
    forward, clocks continue to tick, the second law of thermodynamics
    gradually sees the increase in disorder in the universe, life
    creates new order.

-   Biological processes work against the second law of thermodynamics,
    creating order in plants and animals, where metabolism produces
    order through consuming food, and thought produces increase order in
    our brains. Schroedinger argued that this was a fundamental
    principle of life processes: they work against increasing disorder
    (or *entropy*). Life is about *neg-*entropy:

    > The essential thing in metabolism is that the organism succeeds in
    > freeing itself from all the entropy it cannot help producing while
    > alive. [@schrodinger_what_2012]

-   The unfolding experience of time-based arts like music provides a
    good example of the dynamic tension between entropy and negentropy,
    and has many similarities to the experience of learning. Cinema,
    music and theatre are forms of expression which display two
    interacting dimensions which are also common to all learning
    processes. There is a dimension of structure of things which occur
    at any moment, and there is a dimension of things which unfold over
    time.

-   Science and art look at the world in different ways. Both
    information (neg-entropy) and time are fundamental problems in
    science, which necessitate the descriptions of artists in order to
    deepen understanding

    -   What is the difference between the way the scientist looks at
        nature and the way the artist looks at nature?

    -   What is the value in having multiple rich descriptions of
        something?

    -   What is the risk of only having scientific descriptions of
        something?

Scientific Dialogue
===================

Educational Assessment
----------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Do essays measure a student's understanding or does it measure their
    ability to write essays?

-   How can understanding be measured?

-   Does everybody's understanding take the same form?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   The assessment of learning by institutions is one of their primary
    functions. It involves many levels of bureaucracy and
    decision-making

-   Gaining institutional certificate are one of the reasons why people
    go university in the first place. The certificate is a 'product' of
    the university

-   Universities have to maintain trust in their judgements in order to
    maintain their position in society. If they passed everybody, for
    example, nobody would trust the certificates they award. In this
    sense, "education has to create failure," as Ivan Illich observed
    [@illich_deschooling_1995]

-   The assessment process, objects are produced by students
    (assignments, essays and exams) about which judgements (marks) can
    be made. In order to get good marks, it is important that students
    comply with the expectations of their teachers.

-   It is theoretically possible to comply with teacher expectations
    without understanding very much.


Communicating Uncertainty
-------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   If modern science is driven by calculations of probability, how sure
    can we be that anything is right?

-   What is the difference between the status of scientific knowledge in
    the enlightenment and science today?

-   How should we communicate our uncertainties?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   In 1763 the journal system of blind peer review was designed as a
    democratic mechanisms to establish truth through discursive
    engagement with reports of the empirical regularities of Newtonian
    science.

-   The journal article was well-suited to amplifying the detailed
    description of apparatus, method and results from which speculation
    about causes could follow.

-   Communication of the probabilistic and contingent nature of modern
    science is poorly achieved through the academic journal article.
    When the probabilistic modelling of economics or patterns in DNA,
    the analysis of big data, or the investigation of quantum fields or
    the study of ecologies is represented in the journal literature, the
    reported statistically significant results (reported through
    p-values and statistical hypothesis) often mask the more significant
    uncertainties surrounding the work.

-   There have been attempts to address this. New models of peer-review
    have been introduced alongside new models of open access publishing
    [@anderson_open_2004].

-   More interesting is the demand to make publishing much more
    flexible, embracing things like blogs, and (particularly) the
    publishing of data.

-   Equally, the engagement of a wider community with scientific
    research in initiatives like 'Citizen Science' are more powerful
    ways of coordinating the uncertainties of a much wider section group
    of people, not all of whom will be professional scientists.

-   Such democratisation in the communication of uncertainty is closer
    in spirit to the original ideals that led to the establishment of
    the academic journal in the first place.


Democracy and Science
---------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Is science possible in an unfree society?

-   What is the relation between science and freedom?

-   What is the most effective relation between government and science?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   The academic journal system was a method of democratising science:
    it was important in the establishing of knowledge that experiments
    could be done by many people, and results discussed openly.

-   Before the Royal Society published its transactions in 1667
    (considered to be the first academic journal), publication was not
    considered something that scientists ought to do.

-   Publishing facilitated the formation of large-scale scientific
    communities within which reproducible empirical results could be
    reported and discussed. Publication practice gradually took on the
    form that we now know it.

-   The Royal Society's practices of peer review was a change not only
    in scientific practice and epistemology, but also in the
    democratisation of intellectual status acquisition. Publication and
    admittance to the academy was technically available to all.

-   One of the principles behind this democratising process was that all
    evidence of scientific phenomena should be considered, whether it
    conformed with existing theories or not. This openness to challenge
    was an essential ingredient in the advancement of science.

-   Today, science is often presented in school as being in a late stage
    of advancement where some things are now beyond doubt. Alongside
    this, governments promote science as an essential ingredient to
    economic development.

-   Yet, history tells us that scientific advance usually occurs by
    overturning things which were once thought to be obviously true, and
    that this is sometimes seen as a political challenge to those
    institutions which have built their reputation on the old way of
    doing things (e.g. Galileo)

-   Government promotion of openness in science, and acceptance of the
    possibility that a different way of looking at things is possible,
    also requires government to be open to the potential political
    challenge that science presents.

-   Many current debates, about climate change, genetic engineering,
    artificial intelligence, etc, all have a political side, and all
    tend to adopt accepted positions which may be open to challenge.


Publishing
----------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Why, when there are so many technologies for communicating, do
    scientists continue to publish in academic journals (in the same way
    since 1663?)

-   How can uncertainties been communicated in print?

-   Are we saying more and more about less and less?

-   Whose uncertainty about science isn't relevant to inquiry?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   For academics, publication in high ranking research journals brings
    the prospect of promotion and potential job security in what is
    increasingly an insecure profession (maybe to 'tenured professor' or
    its equivalent - another status declaration within the institution),
    or it brings increased funding within the institution. Institutions
    with many academics producing high-ranking research papers perform
    more highly in international rankings of institutions, which in turn
    increase their chances of winning research funding and recruiting
    high calibre students.

-   Each declaration of status is also a declaration of scarcity, and
    the principal mode of operation of the institution is the declaring
    of knowledge and accreditation for knowing to be scarce. This sits
    at odds with the growth of technologies which provide access to
    knowledge everywhere. Journal publication is a license to make a
    small change to the world. Alongside the license comes other
    prestige indicators which carry value for individuals: in today's
    academia, publications help to secure the position of academics in
    universities (without them, they can lose their jobs). Beyond
    publication itself, citations serve as 'evidence' of approval of a
    community. Fame and status as a "thought leader"
    [@sismondo_key_2013] comes from many citations, which in turn brings
    invitations to keynotes at conferences, editorial roles, expert
    advisory positions, through to secondary studies of an author's
    work. Fundamentally, there is a demarcation between 'academic
    celebrity' and everyone else: academic publication counts because it
    is (or is perceived to be) scarce. This state of affairs raises
    ontological questions about how the social world of science and
    education works.


Dialogue and Science
--------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   When we really listen to each other, and tune-in to another person's
    thought, do we glimpse something of the structure of the universe?

-   Do scientists listen to one another or do they compete for
    attention?

-   What would our scientific institutions look like if we took
    listening to one another as the most important thing to do in
    science?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Bohm argues that "Dialogue is really aimed at going into the whole
    thought process and changing the way the thought process occurs
    collectively. We haven't really paid much attention to thought as a
    process. We have engaged in thoughts, but we have only paid
    attention to the content, not to the process. Why does thought
    require attention? Everything requires attention, really. If we ran
    machines without paying attention to them, they would break down. Or
    thought, too, is a process, and it requires attention otherwise it's
    going to go wrong. "[@bohm_dialogue_2013]

-   Among the symptoms of thought going wrong, Bohm cites
    *fragmentation*, or what others have criticised as *reductionism*:
    the breaking down of knowledge into boxes. Bohm goes on to say:
    "Almost everything around us has been determined by thought -- all
    the buildings, factories, farms, roads, schools nations, science,
    technology, religion -- whatever you care to mention. The whole
    ecological problem is due to thought, because we have thought that
    the world is there for us to exploit, that it is infinite, and so no
    matter what we did, the pollution would all get dissolved away."

-   He points out that "we may clear up the pollution, but may then
    create some other difficulty, such as economic chaos if we don't do
    it right."

-   Finally, he argues: "The point is thought produces results, but
    thought says it didn't do it. And that is a problem."

-   What is the problem with thought denying that it makes things happen
    in the world?


Conversation
------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Why do we need to talk to each other when we are feeling very
    confused and uncertain?

-   How does conversation help manage uncertainty?

-   What is the role of love and friendship in managing uncertainty?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   A conversation is a kind of dance. The word *conversation* comes
    from the Latin, *con-versare*. It means, "to turn together". Two
    people can dance and intuitively understand the moves of the other.

-   Learning conversations are coordinations between a teacher and
    learner. There are always processes of recalibration as the teacher
    recognises the need to simply their own complexity so as to maintain
    an effective dialogue with the learner.

-   Conversations are very powerful: they can change peoples' lives in a
    very short time. The way this happens is poorly understood, and as a
    result, the importance of conversation often gets overlooked in the
    way we organise institutions.

-   One of the drivers for conversation is the fact that everybody sees
    the world differently and everybody feels the need to address their
    uncertainties by understanding better the uncertainties of others.

-   People who have deep conversations together are often friends. This
    is not to say that important conversations only happen between
    friends, but that friendship is the name we give to a particular
    kind of conversational relationship.

-   The root of friendship is the ability to freely express uncertainty.
    Through friendship, things that would be hard to say to others, can
    be said, and deep uncertainties - often about very personal
    matters - can be explored.


Physiology and Knowledge
------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   How do our bodies change the way we interact with others?

-   Is a thought in the brain or in the body or in a community?

-   Why does physical activity and physical contact have such a powerful
    effect on the way we feel?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Most people assume that "knowing", "learning", "remembering", etc
    happens in brains. By implication, they mean that consciousness is a
    property of the brain. There is considerable evidence to support
    this: damaged brains usually produce impairment in cognitive
    function. However, although sometimes radical changes in behaviour
    are observed in those with damaged brains, the humanness of the
    individual remains, and sometime with even severe damage to the
    brain, people seem to retain cognitive function.

-   The more profound changes occur in individuals around a person with
    brain damage: their behaviours change too, as accommodation is made
    for cognitive impairment, extraordinary efforts are made to support
    an individual in the expression of their identity in new ways which
    fit their new condition. Being human, it seems, involves rather more
    than an individual brain. It is not even in the "whole" person. It
    is in the whole community.

-   Processes of empathy and emotional connection are not separate from
    individual high level cognitive function. The separation between
    cognition and emotion has partly been driven by assumptions in
    neuroscience that the brain is a computer. Neurons, axons and
    synapses seem like wires and connections, and the logical firing of
    one neuron seems to trigger knock-on firings of connected neurons,
    much in the same way that an electric signal triggers knock-on
    effects in a circuit.

-   Some physicists [@bohm_wholeness_2002] and neuroscientists
    [@damasio_descartes_2006], however, taken a different view. David
    Bohm was highly aware of the importance of emotion in communication.
    In fact, he believed that direct emotional engagements provided a
    deeper scientific insight into the nature of the world than
    rationalistic talk. His theory of Quantum Mechanics but made a
    connection between the structure and process of matter, and
    consciousness.

-   More recent work on the way music communicates, and particularly on
    the sound relations between mothers and babies, is presenting new
    ways of thinking about emotional expressiveness, physiology and
    meaning [@trevarthen_musicality_1999]


Consciousness and Biology
-------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   If brains are the result of physical processes, which ultimately
    give rise to consciousness, what happens when consciousness
    conceives of the physical processes which underpin it?

**WHY THIS MATTERS**

-   The connection between matter and consciousness must work through
    physiology. Some like Terrence Deacon have made the connection by
    examining how information works from the material world
    [@deacon_incomplete_2012], psychology and through evolution.

-   By focusing on those aspects of biology about which our knowledge is
    rather vague - like epigenesis - Deacon has developed a theory of
    mind based on the study of semiotic communication. However, if there
    is a weakness to this, as with all theories of mind, it lies in the
    theory's ability to account for the way in which it thinks about
    itself.

-   John Torday goes much deeper than this in a theory which draws on
    Bohm's basic idea of what he called the "holographic universe"
    [@bohm_wholeness_2002].

-   Consciousness, Torday argues, arises from the evolution of the cell
    as the basic unit of physiology, and that cellular evolutionary
    process has been driven by the cell's adaptation to ambiguity in its
    environment. Moreover, the cellular adaptive processes reflects
    fundamental structural adaptations in pre-history.

-   Torday suggests that there is a pattern written throughout our flesh
    which connects us to one another and to a single point of origin.

-   This might mean, for example, that when we have deep conversations,
    or experience music together, that the sense of togetherness we
    experience may be a recognition of the common pattern that we share
    in our physiology.

-   In other words, deep thinking about our origins has the same form as
    our origins themselves.


Uncertainty and Dialogue
------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Why does uncertainty give rise to conversation?

-   Is cellular communication similarly a response to the uncertainty in
    a cell's environment?

-   Why might mental illness result from a lack of conversation or
    understanding?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   The environment of all organisms is uncertain or ambiguous. It is
    probably no different for humans than it is for amoebas or cells.

-   When you are unsure or uncertain about something, you talk to
    people. Conversation is one of the principle means of managing
    uncertainty.

-   In the biological theory of Torday
    [@john_s._torday_evolutionary_2012], cellular communication is
    considered to be a response to the ambiguity of the cellular
    environment.

-   Ambiguities and uncertainties are the result of other processes of
    adaptation to uncertainty. There are patterns to the ways in which
    different adaptive processes operate at different levels. In
    physics, these patterns are considered to be 'symmetries' or 'broken
    symmetries'.

-   Broken symmetry is the process whereby quantum mechanics believes
    the structure of matter - atoms, molecules, etc - emerges. Whatever
    originating broken symmetry there was is written in new molecular
    adaptations later on, which in turn are performed in environmental
    contexts which twist the path of evolution in one way or another.
    Torday's biology emphasises the importance of stress from the
    environment, which causes cellular mechanisms to stretch and acquire
    new functions (swim bladders change into lungs, for example). And
    consciousness could be part of the same process.

-   Understanding something deeply means becoming aware of a fundamental
    pattern of broken symmetry which connects us to a common point of
    origin. At its root, "understanding" and what we consider to be
    "spirituality" are the same thing.

-   Because of this, dialogue and conversation become essential tools
    for negotiating understanding and dealing with uncertainty. To
    isolate people from understanding and dialogue is to produce the
    conditions for mental illness.

-   As R.D.Laing noted, mental illness is not the sickness of the
    individual. It is the sickness of their environment
    [@laing_divided_2010]. Being "mentally ill" is the only truly
    authentic reaction to that environment, only exacerbated by the
    naive attempts of others to "cure" the individual.


Ecology of Mind
---------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Is ecology the same as mind?

-   Is our ecological crisis the result of faulty reasoning: an error of
    mind?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Gregory Bateson argued that the evolution was not about the
    development of individual organisms in a process of 'survival of the
    fittest', but about the development of 'organism plus environment'.

-   He argued that if we see evolution as simply organisms competing
    against one another, this results in a destroyed environment,
    which - although it is what often happens in human system - is not
    what happens in natural systems.

-   In considering the unit of evolution as 'organism plus environment',
    he argued that this meant that the organism's *idea* of the
    environment had to be taken into consideration. In effect, this
    meant that in order to understand evolution, we have to understand
    'mind'.

-   Bateson talked of an 'ecology of mind' as the realisation of the
    'pattern which connects'. This is rather difficult to understand -
    and certainly open to interpretation of a kind of loose ecological
    thinking that sees 'interconnectedness' without necessarily
    inquiring into exactly what is connected, or even what a
    'connection' or 'pattern' means.

-   Our ecological crisis does provide an indication that Bateson was
    right. Since our systems of economics, politics, education, media
    and so on all see the world as 'competing organisms', we seem
    incapable of preventing the destruction of our environment.

-   What would our systems of economics, politics, education and media
    look like if we considered their development from Bateson's
    perspective of 'organism plus environment'?

Psychotherapy
-------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Why is talking so powerful in psychotherapy?

-   What is so special about talking about profound things?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   All approaches to psychotherapy, whether those of Freud, Jung, Adler
    or the family therapy of Laing, involve conversation.

-   Whilst we tend to think of conversation as merely the exchange of
    words, in psychotherpeutic contexts, words have very powerful
    effects (as they can also have in education).

-   In many branches of psychotherapy, for example, patients are
    encouraged to talk about their dreams. Freud's theory for this was
    that dreams were an aspect of the subconscious, and that in order to
    help the patient, a re-wiring had to be made between the
    subconscious world in the patient and the conscious real world
    outside.

-   The difficulty that many have with Freud's theories is that it is
    very hard to scientifically identify the subconscious, or the
    distinction between it and the conscious mind. In the end, all we
    have to go on is the communication between people.

-   In the social systems theory of Niklas Luhmann
    [@luhmann_social_1996], Luhmann speculated that in talking, we make
    a series of 'selections': we select a meaning - the thing we want to
    say, and we select an utterance - the way we choose to say it.

-   Luhmann further speculated that our selections are dependent on the
    selections of others, and that in making these selections we
    contribute to our social environment.

-   If the cause of mental illness is in the mismatch between the
    subconscious world and the social environment, then the
    transformation of the social world by drawing things up from the
    subconscious can make an important difference to mental state.



Brains, Hearts and Stomach 
---------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Is your mind in your head?

-   Is your mind in your whole body?

-   Is your mind in the whole social environment?

-   Is your mind in the universe?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   We communicate with each other as whole persons, not just brains or
    mouths.

-   Our bodies are capable of a range of emotions and attitudes
    including love, anger, empathy, fear and pride together with
    intellectual abilities including problem solving, creating and
    remembering.

-   We recognise the difference between these activities partly by the
    way they make us feel.

-   The way different emotions and behaviours make us feel changes the
    way we use our bodies to express ourselves.

-   In Neuro-linguistic programming, for example, studies have been done
    on the ways that individuals move their eyes if they are remembering
    things, or creating things.

-   It many academic disciplines, there are different approaches to a
    topic. Each approach has its own traditions, journals and
    communities. Three major approaches are:

    -   Functionalism - an approach which attempts to identify problems
        and seek solutions. Often functional approaches seek to use
        technology to solve complex human problems, and often these
        approaches fail. 'Giant Mirrors in Space' is a functionalist
        approach to global warming, for example.

    -   Critical theory - this is an approach which criticises
        functionalist approaches. It is politically driven, deriving
        from Marxism, and often considers the down-sided of
        functionalism, particularly who loses, whose rights are
        violated, and so on.

    -   Phenomenology and Existentialism - this is an approach which
        focuses on human experience and consciousness. It opposes
        functionalism because it sees functionalist approaches as cold
        and blind to real people. It is sometimes critical of critical
        theory because Marxist approaches tend to be focused on the
        collective rather than the individual.

-   To be critical, or to be functionalist or to be focused on
    individual human experience are attitudes which seem to feel
    different in the body.

-   In discussion, it is sometimes possible to tell from what position
    an individual is coming by looking at how they use their body. For
    example, functionalists are always inventing and creating things in
    their head. Phenomenologists are often thinking about emotions,
    feelings and experience, which is more concerned with the heart. To
    be critical, by contrast, is something that is often felt in the
    gut!

-   Dialogue is about creating a harmony between all these different
    aspects.

Technology and Business
=======================

Business
--------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   What has technology done to business?

-   What is the difference between the way businesses used to manage
    their transactions in the past and the way they do now?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   New technologies are themselves the result of entrepreneurial firms,
    reducing transaction costs for access to the means of reducing
    transaction costs. It is in this corporate provision of services to
    individuals who seek to reduce their transaction costs in other ways
    that we find today's internet giants.

-   Most of us make transactions in many different domains and engage
    with many different kinds of institution. Over the internet and
    social software, the way transactions are made, the kinds of
    organisations they are made with, the way they are tracked and
    recorded has all been transformed. According to Coase, and later the
    "New Institutionalism"[@powell_new_1991] theorists, whilst the human
    action of transacting is constitutive of the institutions through
    which transactions are exchanged, patterns of communicative
    transactions across different industries can lead to dynamics
    whereby management functions within institutions become coordinated
    in what DiMaggio and Powell identify as 'institutional isomorphism'.
    The basic mechanisms of transaction management have in various ways
    led to the specialised discourses of what has generally been termed
    'managerialism'.


Social Media's Management of Transactions
-----------------------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Why are we addicted to social media?

-   Is the addiction of the population to social in the commercial
    interests of social media companies?

-   How can the social media companies ensure that we continue to be
    addicted?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   When we use social media, we have the impression that we are talking
    to our friends or to a community. It is less obvious that we are
    also talking to the social media company itself.

-   These exchanges with friends and with the media companies are
    'transactions'. This implies some kind of exchange. On social media,
    users exchange their personal data for the services that the social
    media companies provide. ![image](socmed.jpg)

-   Social media companies require these transactions in order to make a
    profit. Their job is to manipulate the context within which
    exchanges or transactions are taking place so that users continue to
    make them.

-   The diagram above shows how the exchanges between users occur in
    contexts which are continually manipulated by the social media
    companies based on their analysis of the data which is exchanged
    between users.

-   Social media 'addiction' is, to some extent, 'engineered' since it
    is in the corporate interests of the social media company.


Viable Systems
--------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   What is the difference between a living system like a bee-hive and a
    business?

-   Are there common organising principles which unite all living
    things?

-   Are there common organisational dangers which can lead to the death
    of any living thing?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Beer's Viable System Model (VSM) describes multiple levels of
    organisation in an organism in an environment. Each level is a kind
    of conversion of one form of information into another: what is
    called a 'transduction'

-   In the VSM, five 'regulating mechanisms' are specified whose job is
    to maintain the viability of the whole entity. The purpose of the
    system is to manage complexity, which is measured by how much
    'variety' the system possesses. Beer explains that "the regulator
    has to be capable of generating a variety equivalent to the variety
    that has to be regulated -- or the regulator will fail".
    [@beer_heart_1995].

-   An organism's variety is managed in relation to the variety of its
    environment. Typically, the environment is more complex (has higher
    variety) than the organism.

-   If the variety of the environment overwhelms the system, then the
    system is at risk of collapse through unmanageable oscillation
    (competing for resources) amongst the system's components. The
    viable system must attenuate the variety of the environment and
    amplify its own operations in order to ensure viable operation.

    ![image](VSM.jpg)

-   The different regulating systems are:

    -   System 1: the components which actually 'do the work' on the
        ground: the meaningful different activities that a business has
        to do.

    -   System 2: is responsible for ensuring that the different
        activities of system 1 do not conflict with each other.

    -   System 3: is responsible for ensuring adequate resources are
        provided to the different components in system 1. It is
        responsible for 'operational management'

    -   System 4: is responsible for 'strategic management'. It's role
        is to inspect the environment of the system and look for threats
        and opportunities, instructing system 3 about what might need to
        change

    -   System 5: is responsible for maintaining the balance between
        system 3 and system 4. In doing so, it maintains the identity of
        the whole system.

-   Beer's VSM is a recursive model. Each element in system 1 has
    exactly the same form (systems 1 - 5) as the higher level system
    that contains it.

-   You can imagine the VSM mapped on to a person:

    -   System 1 represents all the daily things that you do.. talking
        to people, using technology, reading this, and so on.

    -   System 2 represents the rules that you use to ensure that all
        the things that you do do not conflict with one another. This is
        a bit like a schedule or a to-do list.

    -   System 3 represents planning for the tasks ahead: making sure
        you have the equipment you need, enough time, and so on.

    -   System 4 represents your thinking about possible threats and
        opportunities in the future. System 4 is about imagination and
        dreams for the future. It has to talk to System 3 to tell it how
        System 3 might need to reprioritise things.

    -   System 5 is your identity, it maintains a balance of the other
        systems in the environment so that you present a coherent
        statement of who you are to others.


Cool tools: Keep Clicking!
--------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Why are there more and more cool things on the internet?

-   Why does Facebook, Twitter, VK, etc want you to keep clicking on
    cool tools?

-   Is fake news driven by politics or is it driven by the commercial
    requirements of platform companies to maintain user transactions?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   'Cool' tools increase the transaction count in ways which users are
    not aware. This is particularly true of online gaming platforms,
    fitness trackers, AI Bots and new technological experiences like
    Virtual Reality. In these cases, tiny transactions of data feeds
    give information about aspects of behaviour which users themselves
    are unaware: the movement of the head and eyes in virtual reality, a
    person's heart rate, location information, particular phrases used
    by people talking to a Bot, or learning processes as a game player
    solves a puzzle. In each case, the data can be harvested. Since
    users are increasingly operating within the defined constraints of
    online platforms, the data can help adjust those constraints in
    particular ways so as to steer behaviour. Machine learning can
    record patterns of interaction and make inferences about behaviour
    to steer users towards serving the needs of the corporations who
    provide the communications services.

-   The economics behind the 'fun' of new 'cool' technology drives
    continual innovation online. Every week, we see news of some new
    technology that facilitates new forms of interaction: it might be a
    new computer game, or some new service for translation (like Google
    translate's magical ability to automatically identify text in images
    and translate it), or a new feature in SnapChat, or voice-activated
    devices like Amazon's echo, or Virtual reality, or a new phone app.
    One of the exciting things about technology is that we struggle to
    imagine what will become possible next year.

-   Every innovation is the same in the sense that every innovation
    seeks to engage users in interaction. Without interaction, without
    increased transactions, the innovation dies alongside its corporate
    infrastructure.

-   It is only through the transactions with a company's services that
    the company exists. And it is only by harvesting the data from those
    transactions that the company can make profits. The online service
    company has to create the conditions for the exchange of many
    transactions and use the intelligence it gathers from those
    transactions to:

    1.  provide targeted advertising services;

    2.  provide analytic services to other corporate clients;

    3.  steer user behaviour by constraining the information environment
        in the platform in directions which favour corporate clients;

    4.  steer the userbase of the platform into new practices and
        services which increase their engagement and broaden the
        network.


Hierarchies
-----------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Do we need kings, presidents, bosses and institutions?

-   How might the world look if there was no hierarchy?

-   Does technology want to do what an institution does?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Universities, churches, schools, armies, governments, corporations
    and scout groups, are organised hierarchically. That means there is
    a boss at the top (a high-priest, king, vice-chancellor, president,
    rector) and there are departments below them, each with a head, and
    under each division there are divisional-heads, with umpteen
    sub-divisions under them, when finally there are individual workers
    whose function is to ensure that their divisional head can't be
    blamed for anything.

-   Human hierarchies serve multiple functions. They codify the division
    of labour within an organisation, they provide a structure for
    managing complexity of an organisation, and - perhaps most
    importantly - they provide 'lines of responsibility' which
    apportions credit and blame to different members of an organisation
    when their sections either succeed or fail.

-   Because of this, they also serve to maintain a degree of conformity
    with the standards and expectation of the person at the top of the
    hierarchy. In a University, hierarchy also reinforces the
    structuring of knowledge as it has emerged through the curriculum.

-   Those at the top of hierarchies can make declarations about what
    becomes real for others in the organisation: the president can
    declare new laws, the head of a university can declare new rules for
    examinations, and so on.

-   Hierarchies also declare that some things are scarce: for example, a
    bank declares that money is scarce, and in so doing, it upholds its
    value.


Attenuation in Hierarchies
--------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   How much information about an organisation can the boss absorb?

-   How much information is lost in the process of reporting what is
    actually happening in a business?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   The underlying principle of hierarchy is *attenuation*. Highly
    complex phenomena carries a rich variety of descriptions which has
    to be squeezed to single description summaries of 'what is going on'
    that the senior management team can absorb.

-   In any institutional hierarchy, this attenuation works both in a
    'vertical' way, from the bottom of an organisation to the top, and
    in a 'horizontal' way, whereby each individual has to attenuate the
    complexity of the totality of the environment within which they
    live. Since each individual is every other individual's environment,
    any organisation features horizontal attenuation at all levels
    between all individuals. Figure
    [[fig:hierarchyattenuate]](#fig:hierarchyattenuate){reference-type="ref"
    reference="fig:hierarchyattenuate"} shows the patterns of
    attenuation and the division of knowledge in the institutional
    structure.

    ![The attenuations of
    hierarchy[]{label="fig:hierarchyattenuate"}](Slide5){#fig:hierarchyattenuate
    width="columnwidth"}

-   This diagram is however, simplistic. Humans, like other animals,
    shape their environment to suit themselves. From the attenuation of
    the environment to simple organisational principles, humans amplify
    these organisational principles by making changes to their
    environment such that their organising principles provide a reliable
    way of coordinating themselves. This action to shape the environment
    represents the opposite of attenuation: it is an amplification of an
    individual's understanding of their environment.

-   In modern organisations, the attenuation process from bottom to top,
    and from the environment to the individual, is driven by
    *information*: data on everything from class attendance, student
    surveys, pass rates and student fee income is collected and
    processed to assist organisational decision-making. Impressive
    though this range of data is, and hypnotic our modern data analytic
    software, such information is always constraint - it is always a
    tool of attenuation. What gets left out? Unfortunately, what is left
    out often reveals itself as a menacing force appearing from nowhere
    which produces sudden shocks to hierarchies. Such is the story of
    most recent institutional crises from the financial collapse of
    banks and corporations, child abuse in the church, illegal behaviour
    of journalists, health scandals, abuse of power by Hollywood moguls
    and the expenses of politicians.


Are Hierarchies Sustainable in a world of Uncertainty?
------------------------------------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Do institutional hierarchies contribute to the conditions that might
    threaten them?

-   Are there alternative forms of organisation which are not
    hierarchical?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Many human hierarchical organisations have experienced shocks and
    crises of confidence in recent years (for example, child abuse in
    the Catholic church, scandals in the press, government scandals,
    corporate failures). In some cases, these institutions appear out of
    control.

-   These scandals are 'shocks' from the environment to which the
    institution has to respond. Their effect is to reveal that the
    environment within which the institution thought it was operating
    with some certainty, suddenly turns out to be *uncertain*.

-   Institutions respond to this uncertainty with bureaucratic
    processes: there are inquiries, restructures, people responsible are
    identified and removed, and so on. The effect and the motivation of
    these processes is to preserve the institution's structure. The
    critically important thing is that most institutions have to react
    to environmental uncertainties which they themselves create! How
    does this happen?

    Figure
     [[fig:uncertaininstitution]](#fig:uncertaininstitution){reference-type="ref"
    reference="fig:uncertaininstitution"} shows the dynamic relationship
    between environmental uncertainty and the institution's response to
    it as a positive feedback loop.

    ![The positive feedback between institutional hierarchy and an
    increasingly uncertain
    environment[]{label="fig:uncertaininstitution"}](Slide8){#fig:uncertaininstitution
    width="columnwidth"}

-   Hierarchies are uncommon in nature: the natural world is
    *ecological*, where differences between elements which might appear
    to be in a hierarchy (say, the levels of the food chain) are
    interlinked in ways which mean that domination by one level over
    another leads to catastrophe.

-   Equally, the brain is not the boss of the body. The body comprises
    multiple components which work together coordinated by signals
    passed through the central nervous system.

-   In the natural world, in place of hierarchy, we see circularity.
    This is because natural structures seek viability and adaptability
    in response to a changing environment. Circular organisational
    structures help achieve this through continual organic adaptation.



Predicting Technology
---------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   How can we predict the 'next thing' in technology?

-   What do computers do to organisations and society?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   To understand the potential social impact of technology is to
    understand the relationship between technology and institutions.
    Both technology and institutions mediate transactions between
    people. In both cases, this mediation is conducted against a
    background of risk.

-   Predictions about the impact of technology can be made in two ways.
    On the one hand, we can seek to establish trends from a wide variety
    of observed phenomena. This approach is called 'synthetic'.
    Alternatively, we can analyse the deeper underlying mechanisms which
    produce today's phenomena, and to draw out from those mechanisms the
    phenomena which might present us tomorrow. This approach is called
    'analytic'.

-   An example of a successful analytical approach to technology
    prediction is contained in Winograd and Flores's book "Understanding
    computers and cognition", which was published in 1986
    [@winograd_understanding_1986] Winograd and Flores sought to
    identify the underlying mechanisms which produced the technology of
    their time using cybernetic analysis and philosophy. Their
    conclusion was strongly critical of the prevailing 'synthetic'
    understanding of technology in the pre-internet age that computers
    were about data processing and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Whilst
    the superficial appearances of technology suggested that AI and data
    indicated the future, Winograd and Flores's analytical approach
    identified human communication as the domain of fundamental
    transformation by computers in 1986, and which, they argued, would
    continue to be changed in the future (this was before the Worldwide
    Web)

-   Within a few years it became obvious that they were right. The
    'workflow' technology which they pioneered on the back of their
    philosophical and technological critique became one of the major
    components of corporate IT communications infrastructure.

-   Their argument was that computers were both constructed *in
    langauge* and were tools *of language* focused on the 'speech acts'
    which are performed through computers (drawing on the Speech act
    theory of Austin and Searle).

-   Computers recorded speech acts, and through them the commitments
    which human beings make to each other - those exchanges which are
    critical to the establishment of trust between human beings - can be
    managed and tracked, even to the point that eventually

    > New computer-based communication technology can help anticipate
    > and avoid breakdowns ... we can partially anticipate situations
    > where breakdowns are likely to occur (by noting their recurrence)
    > and we can provide people with the tools and procedures they need
    > to cope with them. Moreover, new conversational networks can be
    > designed that give the organisation the ability to recognise and
    > realise new possibilities. [@winograd_understanding_1986]

-   The fact that the computer kept a *record* of all the speech acts
    that everyone made was for Winograd and Flores the critical issue.
    Curiously, despite their anti-AI stance, this basic idea of storing
    and analysing speech acts lies behind what we now consider to be the
    major achievements of modern AI: social media on the internet
    provides the 'big data' from which data mining techniques identify
    precisely what Winograd and Flores were articulating: Ways of
    anticipating - and potentially avoiding - breakdown.


Transactions and Institutions
-----------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   What is the role of institutions in brokering the transactions
    between individuals?

-   What is technology doing to the management of transactions in
    businesses?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   The impact of computers on most industries, from retail to finance,
    has been an ever-increasing atomisation of transaction processing
    alongside ever more sophisticated means of orchestrating different
    transaction processing services.

-   The relationship between transactions and institutions was first
    studied in the 1930s in the economic work of Ronald
    Coase[@coase_firm_1990]. In developing his theory, Coase argued that
    economics was upside-down. It concentrated on the means for
    producing economic outcomes, but ignored the social entities through
    which the means and ends of economics were negotiated. Coase
    highlighted that there was in economics no questioning about the
    existence of markets, banks, firms, governments and so on. His
    suggestion was to see that social entities like markets were created
    through the transactions which individuals created with them:

    > the operation of a market costs something and by forming an
    > organisation and allowing some authority (an "entrepreneur") to
    > direct the resources, certain marketing costs are saved. The
    > entrepreneur has to carry out his function at less cost, taking
    > into account the fact that he may get factors of production at a
    > lower price than the market transactions which he supersedes,
    > because it is always possible to revert to the open market if he
    > fails to do this. [@coase_firm_1990]

-   The establishment of an institution like a market arose because the
    cost of transactions between a seller and their customers could be
    reduced by the entrepreneurial creation of an entity to broker
    exchange between individuals. Coase goes on to discuss the role of
    technology in facilitating transactions:

    > Inventions which tend to bring factors of production nearer
    > together, by lessening spatial distribution, tend to increase the
    > size of the firm. Changes like the telephone and the telegraph
    > which tend to reduce the cost of organising spatially will tend to
    > increase the size of the firm.


Social Media Corporate Value
----------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Why does Facebook's share price drop if it loses users?

-   What does Facebook have to do to keep and increase users?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   The fall in the number of transactions which Twitter experienced has
    had a significant effect on Twitter's share
    price[@noauthor_twitter_2016]. Equally, the price demanded by
    Snapchat is dependent on the number of transactions which it
    produces. This is the essential index of the 'coolness' of the
    technology [@noauthor_snapchat_2017].

-   Each social media corporation seeks to increase the transactions its
    customers have. The conventional rationale for maintaining this is
    that whilst customers are contributing transactions to the
    corporations they are more likely to see advertising.

-   Through making useful distinctions between pay-by-click links and
    free links, companies can create the conditions where some
    transactions (and eventually those transactions which lead to income
    generation) become more likely.

-   The challenge for Social Media companies is always to increase the
    number of transactions that individuals have with their services.
    They can do this in many ways, partly by manipulating the items
    which appear to users to align with their preferences, and partly by
    innovating new tools and services which encourage people to click
    more.

Trust and the Algorithm
-----------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Why do you trust Google, Facebook, VK, Amazon?

-   What would be the consequences of a loss of trust in the security of
    shopping online?

-   Does trust have to be in an institution? Can it be in an algorithm?

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Customer trust is critical to all businesses. If customers lose
    trust in a company, it goes out of business.

-   The web has been used as a tool for the coordination of contracts
    between buyers and sellers since the dot-com boom of the early
    2000s. This has relied on the establishment of trust in online
    payments.

    ![image](rouble.jpg)

-   Trust on the internet is managed by algorithms which encode credit
    card details and other information in forms which mean that these
    details remain private. Imagine if the cryptographic keys which
    maintain trust in online payments are hacked, and no online payments
    could be secure anymore. What would be the implications?

-   Although we think we trust companies like Paypal or Mastercard,
    really we are putting our trust in these cryptographic algorithms.

-   Algorithms of trust do not need to be centralised around a
    particular company. Bitcoin is a cyptographic algorithm without any
    kind of institution or business to uphold its value.

-   The same principle which upholds trust in Bitcoin can be used to
    uphold trust in other services like selling goods, hotels, taxis,
    travel, etc.

-   In the future we may see individuals trusting algorithmic processes
    themselves, rather than institutions which use those processes.
    Sometimes, the operation of algorithms themselves is clearer and
    more transparent than the operation of businesses.

-   In the future, we may see This is leading to what people are calling
    the 'decentralised web', where contractual exchanges between
    individuals are coordinated through algorithms rather than through
    brokers.


Worldwide Web Decentralisation and Institutions
-----------------------------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Why is centralisation of the worldwide web a problem?

-   What might decentralisation mean for businesses?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   When Tim Berners-Lee invented the worldwide web, he envisaged a
    platform which would remove barriers of access to information and
    overcome the limitations of hierarchical structures in institutions.

-   What's actually happened to the worldwide web is that it has
    reproduced institutional hierarchies, and now the internet is
    dominated by a handful of (mostly American) companies: Google,
    Facebook, etc.

-   This has also produced problems in terms of privacy and data
    management, and user worries about surveillance.

-   The reasons why this has happened are partly technical and partly to
    do with trust. Technically, the internet relies on a protocol called
    *Hypertext Transport Protocol* (http) which identifies individual
    servers as the source of files and gives them a name. When we type
    "google.com" we are accessing files on Google's server's.

-   Because results from Google become trusted, more and more people use
    Google, giving them more data, and increasing their market value.

-   Web decentralisation works by not storing files on particular
    servers, but rather distributing files and servers across many
    machines in the internet.

-   The location of a file is no longer a particular server, but a code
    which reassembles the file from many different machines.

-   What this means is that the transactions of users are no longer with
    a particular company which acts as a broker, but with specific files
    which are distributed. Potentially this can disrupt centralised
    businesseses because they no longer control access to files: files
    are distributed.

Data
====

Big Data
--------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   What does Facebook or VK know about you?

-   Is big data just counting?

-   Can big data be intelligent?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Data analysis, whether the data is big or small is really all about
    counting. Typically, 'big data' may involve the counting of words or
    clicks on a webpage. But what makes 'big data' so countable? What,
    in fact are we counting? When is one click the same as another?

-   The counting that Facebook and other social media companies do does
    seem to be remarkably effective. It is able to make prediction about
    the social status and economic value of individual users, it is able
    to predict how they might vote, and it is able to target them with
    advertising that fits their profile.

-   Google translate does a remarkable job in converting one language to
    another by simply counting words.

-   Text analysis software, which Google translate relies on, works by
    counting individual words, and groups of words. For example, a
    bigram is group of two adjacent words ("the cat", "cat sat",
    "sat on"), and equally we can count trigrams, with 3 words.

-   However, it may be going too far to say that intelligence results
    from counting. The counting removes uncertainties about things, and
    presents summaries of a person or a translation which may or may not
    be correct. However, such summaries are never *complete*: in any
    process of counting, what is not counted is usually the most
    important thing.


What is counting?
-----------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   What is exactly the same as something else?

-   Can we imagine counting anything outside time?

-   Is counting merely a social convention?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   The idea of quantifying anything is problematic, and in order to
    quantify, a key distinction has to be made about what is the 'same'
    as something else. All quantities are, at some level, *relations*.

-   Bateson argues: "It is impossible, in principle, to explain any
    pattern by invoking a single quantity. But note that a ratio between
    two quantities is already the beginning of pattern. In others words,
    quantity and pattern are of different logical type and do not
    readily fit together in the same thinking. "[@bateson_steps_1987]

-   Counting is the determination and aggregation of things which are
    like one another (analogies), and of surprises - or anomalies.
    Analogies are not determinable without the determination of
    anomalies. Fundamentally there is a distinction.

-   These distinctions have to be agreed - at least between scientists.
    If scientists didn't agree what they were counting then coherent
    scientific discourse would not be possible.

-   Whenever you see a data analytical report, you should always ask
    "What is being counted?", "What is considered to be the same?",
    "What is considered to be different?"

-   Agreement of analogies and anomalies is a conversation between
    scientists. Without actual embodied participation in the phenomena
    which produce the analogies and anomalies, there is no way of
    coordinating the conversation. Without any way of coordinating the
    conversation, there is an encroaching mysticism in the whole process
    of data analysis.

-   Data risks becoming a kind of religion divorced from science.
    Education driven by data in this way is also divorced from science.
    We end up in the worst-case scenario: an educational system
    renouncing the humanities and arts because they are unscientific,
    whilst embracing a science which is in the thrall of unreliable data
    analysis!


Senders and Receivers
---------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   What must a sender do to a message to ensure that it is correctly
    received?

-   How might the 'noise' of the channel of communication be overcome?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Imagine you are trying to communicate to somebody in a noisy room
    where there is a distance between you and the other person. What do
    you do? Shout? Wave your arms? Text them? Maybe you try all sorts of
    things. What you are doing is trying to say the thing you want to
    say in many different ways. This is amplification.

-   Shannon drew a diagram indicating the basic hurdle of
    communication - some kind of amplification was required.

-   For Shannon, amplification requires the adding of 'redundancy'.
    Redundancy might mean adding extra bits to the message to ensure
    that the differences in entropy between the different symbols would
    still be apparent even if the transmission was degraded. To do this,
    Shannon argued that *redundancy* was a critical element in message
    transmission.

-   If redundancy was added by adding extra bits to the message then it
    meant that the bandwidth between the sender and the receiver should
    be increased. If redundancy was added through repetition,
    transmission would be slower.

-   So by calculating the complexity of the message to be sent, the
    degradation of the signal on the medium over a distance, and the
    amount of redundancy that was needed to be added in order to counter
    the effects of degradation, Shannon was able to calculate the
    necessary bandwidth for transmission.

-   Although he never considered that his mathematical theory was
    applicable outside the domain of electronic communication, Shannon's
    theory and ideas about redundancy have been very useful in
    understanding human communication.

and receiver[]{label="ref:shannon"}](shannon){#ref:shannon

Shannon Information Theory
--------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Can the meaning of something be calculated?

-   Can the information in something be calculated?

-   Can knowledge be calculated?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Shannon's Information theory calculations are detailed in his book
    "A Mathematical Theory of Communication"
    [@shannon_mathematical_1949]. In this book, he adapted Boltzmann's
    idea of thermodynamic entropy (which was a measure of heat
    dispersion) into a measure of the surprisingness of messages
    transmitted through a medium.

-   Information theory underpins the principles of digital
    communication, compression and encryption. Without it, we would not
    have the basic mechanics of the internet, let alone the transmission
    of video, audio, pictures or text which is carried over it.

-   It has found application beyond technology: in biology, Shannon
    entropy has been used as an index of biological growth, of ecosystem
    development [@odum_fundamentals_1959] and epigenesis
    [@deacon_incomplete_2012]; in physics, it is used to explore quantum
    mechanics and quantum computing [@results_programming_2007];

-   in the social sciences, it is used to explore scientific discourse
    and big data [@leydesdorff_knowledge-based_2006]; in geography, it
    is used to understand urban development [@haken_information_2015];

-   in neuroscience it is used to explore the working of the brain
    [@ashby_design_2013]; in anthropology, it is used to explore
    cultural behaviour [@bateson_steps_1987]; in the arts, it is used to
    explore aesthetics [@kanach_formalized_1992].

-   Information theory measures the complexity of a message by
    calculating the probability of each event and producing an index of
    the 'average surprisingness' of a sequence of messages expressed in
    terms of the number of 'bits' or on-off switches which would be
    required to transmit a message of this complexity.

-   Information is not the same a meaning. Shannon never believed that
    meaning could be understood through his theory, although other
    theorists (including Shannon's collaborator, Warren Weaver) do
    believe that deeper issues of meaning can be understood in this way.

How Information Theory Works
----------------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   How does Information Theory provide an index to complexity?

-   Why is it useful?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Consider a very simple message:

    > A A A A A A A A

    For each symbol in a message, we can calculate its surprisingness by
    multiplying its probability by the $log_2$ of its probability. The
    total surprisingness of the message is the sum of this calculation
    for all the different symbols which appear. With 8 A's, the number
    of symbols is 1, and the probability of A appearing is 1. The $log$
    of 1 is 0, therefore, the surprisingness of the message is
    $1 times 0 = 0$.

-   Now consider this sequence:

    > A A B A A A A B

    Here, there are two symbols, so we calculate the probability of each
    symbol and multiply it by the $log$ of the probability of each
    symbol. So the probability of A is $frac{6}{8}$ and the probability
    of B is $frac{2}{8} = frac{1}{4}$. Information theory calculates
    $log$s to base 2. This is because in digital signals, something can
    be either *on* or *off*. Shannon's central problem which he sought
    to address was how many *on/off* switches would be required to
    transmit a particular message with a particular degree of
    surprisingness. There had to be enough switches to generate the
    *variety* of different symbols that were required to be sent.

    So we can use $log_2$ to calculate $log_2 frac{6}{8} = -0.415$ and
    $log_2 frac{1}{4} = -2$. Now we multiply these $log$ values with
    the probability of those values to give
    $frac{6}{8} times -0.415 = -0.311$ and
    $frac{1}{4} times -2 = 0.5$. Adding them together gives $-0.811$.
    So the addition of an extra symbol produces quite a jump in entropy.
    Note, if there was only one B in a sea of A's, then the average
    surprisingness would be *higher*: $log_2frac{1}{8} = -3$ and
    $log_2frac{7}{8} = -0.192$, and multiplying these by the
    probabilities gives: $frac{1}{8} times -3 = -0.375$ and
    $frac{7}{8} times -0.192 = -0.168$ giving a total of $0.543$.


Shannon Redundancy
------------------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   Is saying the same thing many times, in many different ways a waste
    or a necessity?

-   How much of life is repetition?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Redundancy basically means repeating something. However, things can
    be repeated in different ways: you can send a text, make a phone
    call, send a letter, make a video, etc.

-   Redundancy is important because it is the way in which we try to
    ensure that a message is sent successfully and its meaning is
    understood.

-   In Shannon information theory, the challenge was to send a message
    over a 'noisy' medium (think of a noisy room). In Shannon's theory,
    this might mean repeating the message, adding extra bits to check
    the transmission, or to present the same message in a different way.
    In fact, whichever technique is used, redundancy amounts to
    *creating alternative descriptions of the same thing*.

-   When we talk to each other, very often the same idea gets expressed
    in many different ways. The act of teaching is about finding many
    ways in which a concept can be explained ('think about it like
    this', 'do this exercise', 'let me tell you a story...')

-   In Shannon's theory, redundancy is a way of thinking about the rules
    which say that some symbols are used more often than others. In
    language, this is called a grammar. Once somebody knows the grammar,
    messages are more easily understood.

-   Redundancy is the inverse of information. If information is the
    'figure', redundancy is the 'background'.

![image](gestalt_figure_ground.jpg)


Probability
-----------

**KEY QUESTIONS**

-   What is the difference between the chance of rolling a 6 with dice,
    and the chance of it raining tomorrow?

-   If you are told you have a 2% chance of having a heart attack, what
    does that mean?

-   Is improbability the same as surprisingness?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   The mathematical theory of probability focuses on those situations,
    such as games, where the number of possible options is clearly
    known.

-   Many events in daily life do not have this property: the number of
    possible factors and options is often unknown.

-   Some things which might be described as 'improbable' are
    'surprising'. However, what is perceived as surprising might be
    subjective ignorance rather than objective probability.

-   However in modern statistics and game theory, uncertainties over the
    maximum number of possible events is often overlooked: instead real
    situations are treated like abstract 'game' situations.

-   The problem of surprisingness is related to the issue of induction:
    that if something has happened before, it becomes more likely to
    happen again. Again, this assumption can be unreliable.

-   Probability is very important in quantum mechanics because there is
    no certainty about the position of a subatomic particle until it is
    observed. Therefore, the position of the particle is represented by
    a 'wave function' which is effectively a map of the probabilities of
    the particle at different positions. These probability distributions
    are, however, accurate in making predictions - a feature that has
    been exploited in quantum computing.

![image](probability.png)

Ergodicity
----------

**KEY QUESTION**

-   Is the complexity of something over a period of time the same as the
    complexity of that thing over a different period of time?

-   What is the difference in complexity from one period of time to
    another?

-   How does complexity change?

**WHY DOES THIS MATTER?**

-   Ergodicity is a statistical property of system whereby a measure of
    its behaviour over a particular time period is seen to be the same
    as a measure of its behaviour over a long period. It's often used in
    information theory as a way of describing the Shannon entropy of a
    system over one period of time to another. For example, Shannon
    measured the entropy of the English language as a distribution of
    letters. This measurement is ergodic to the extent that the shorter
    sample contains a representative sample of the grammar and syntax of
    the language, and that over a larger sample the value of the entropy
    of the language is no different.

-   The principles of ergodicity rely on some assumptions:

    -   the "alphabet" of what is counted is made explicit at the
        beginning and does not change.

    -   the constraints which determine the distribution of symbols do
        not change

    Shannon's reticence to apply information theory to the study of
    meaning, or the more profound features of living systems rested, I
    believe, on the fact that he knew that with living systems, neither
    of these assumptions about ergodicity are true.

-   Living systems do not present a complete countable "alphabet" of
    things to count at the outset. Countable things are emergent: before
    you have fingers, you have cells. Partly this is because the second
    assumption is wrong - the constraints within which living things
    grow and adapt are continually changing. Indeed, the very process of
    life is a process of auto-generating constraint - what the
    biologists call "autocatalysis".

-   Learning, for example, is part of a living process. Learning
    conversations are rather like dances where nobody quite knows the
    rules, and indeed, the rules change as it goes along. But somehow
    the whole thing has coherence. This is a mystery which I believe the
    analysis of music can help illuminate. Both music and learning
    conversations develop by creating new constraints and emerging new
    significant (countable) things. The dynamics and effectiveness of a
    learning conversation, as a piece of music, rests on how those
    constraints interact. It turns out that each new expression is a
    redundant expression - it says something that has already been said
    before but in a different way.

<h1>Foreword {#foreword .unnumbered}<a class="headerlink" href="#foreword-foreword-unnumbered" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>In the late 1970s when microcomputers began to make their presence felt,
some educators began to experiment with them as tools to support
learning. Inspired by people like Seymour Papert in his book Mindstorms
they believed that finally the shackles of traditional education could
be thrown off, and a new learner-centred, participative and
investigative education would take over. No more boring lectures, no
more rote memorisation, but instead active, engaged, self-directed
learning. This optimism in the potential positive transformative effect
of technology persisted throughout the 1980s, despite little evidence of
significant change, and even increased in the next decade as the world
became connected via the World Wide Web. The lack of institutional
progress was blamed on lack of sufficient hardware, bandwidth, processor
power and teacher knowledge. Now, almost twenty years later, it is clear
that there was something wrong in the naive views of the enthusiastic
proponents of technology for education. Schools, colleges and
universities remain almost completely unchanged in their patterns of
operation. Students still sit in rows listening to hour long lectures
delivered from the front, courses consist of lecture programmes,
curricula abound. Technology has been subsumed into the traditional
forms of education.</p>
<p>In this book, Mark Johnson sets out to explain how it is that the
education system and its constituent institutions have managed to
maintain their organisational structure despite the enormous
possibilities for change that technology offers. Rather than offering a
critique of the system, he instead provides the reader with new tools to
understand the functioning of educational organisations, especially
universities. He argues that the neglected science of cybernetics can
offer deep insights, and elaborates on a number of cybernetic concerns
that are crucial to developing a new understanding of education - how we
make distinctions, conversation theory, and organisation theory. As he
unfolds these ideas, he applies them to building a new description of
the educational enterprise, shedding light on how we have ended up where
we are, and on how we might organise things differently. Underpinning
his argument is a devastating critique of the current state of
universities and the policies that caused it. Dominating managerialism,
the commodification of learning, the negative effect of the Research
Assessment Exercise and its successor the Research Excellence Framework
on the quality of publications and the scientific endeavour are all
signs of a system in danger of collapse into irrelevance, and worse, the
change in university funding threatens to undermine a proper evaluation
of students’ state of understanding. Instead of providing a creative
tool for investigation and collaborative learning, technology has been
appropriated by management to control and micro-manage the “student
experience” using so-called learner analytics.</p>
<p>This is an important and challenging book. It contains tools that offer
the potential for change through a deep understanding of the fabric of
the education system, and should be read by anyone concerned with the
future of education.</p>

<h2>A Guide to Reading the Book {#a-guide-to-reading-the-book .unnumbered}<a class="headerlink" href="#a-guide-to-reading-the-book-a-guide-to-reading-the-book-unnumbered" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This book is about the whole system of higher education in a world of
technology. It is the result of many years of work in educational
technology, cybernetics and philosophy. Writing it has been a project of
working out my understanding of education and technology on a large
canvas, which has given me scope for expressing an holistic and synoptic
view based on the science of cybernetics. As such, the book bears some
scars of an emerging theory, composed over a period where I both
observed and was subject to many of the benefits and pathologies of the
current higher education system, including at one point the anguish of
unemployment and the insecurity of casualisation which has afflicted so
many academics in recent years. Nevertheless, I have found my
theoretical ‘underlabouring’ of practical value in many of the projects
I have been involved in as an educational technologist.</p>
<p>A recent large-scale example of its practical application occurred at
the Far Eastern Federal University in Russia in 2018, where the ‘whole
system intervention’ approach which is described in the following
chapters underpinned an educational design that brought teachers,
learners and managers together. The story of this intervention is told
in the introduction, and I have included it because I hope it brings to
life some of the more abstract ideas in the book. Interventions like
this can be seen as grounding points which respond to powerful questions
about education.</p>
<p>This book itself is also an experiment. The use of self-publishing
technologies for its production and distribution is a further example of
how my thinking has been affected by the theory it presents. I
eventually reached the conclusion that the logic of my argument about
conversation, openness and uncertainty dictated that the circumvention
of traditional academic publishers was an essential practical
intervention to preserve the integrity of the theory and to provide an
example to others (see chapter 6). In the spirit of the theory, I have
not only self-published the book, but made the source-files from which
the book is constructed available for others to appropriate or change as
they wish. Fundamentally, I believe the spirit of openness must entail a
genuine giving-up of ownership. Of course, time may prove me wrong or
irrelevant - but this would be an empirical finding which I can explore
in subsequent versions of the book.</p>
<p>I have divided the book into four sections, and each section contains a
brief introduction to the main thrust of the arguments of its chapters.
These sectional introductions are probably the best place to start
reading to get a feel for the whole thing. The sections are:</p>
<div class="section" id="part-1-cybernetics-conversation-and-education-s-distinctions-part-1-cybernetics-conversation-and-educations-distinctions-unnumbered">
<h3>Part 1: Cybernetics, conversation and education’s distinctions {#part-1-cybernetics-conversation-and-educations-distinctions .unnumbered}<a class="headerlink" href="#part-1-cybernetics-conversation-and-education-s-distinctions-part-1-cybernetics-conversation-and-educations-distinctions-unnumbered" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The basic issue in Part 1 concerns the way we reason about education,
and how cybernetic science helps us understand what technology has done
to it. Faced with intractable uncertainty and confusion about education,
somehow we manage to coordinate educational processes which, partly
through their inadequacy, contribute to the uncertainty. Chapter 1 is
about how we make distinctions about education, how this
distinction-making process is context-dependent, and how we manage to
codify processes to keep the thing together. Chapter 2 introduces
conversation and multiple description as key issues in educational
processes. Chapter 3 considers the inter-personal, inter-subjective
aspect of human engagement, and considers the impact of social media on
human organisation and communication. At a time when market-driven
‘student-centred’ education is the mantra of governments and
vice-chancellors, chapters 2 and 3 articulate a framework for
dialogue-centredness. Chapter 4 considers issues of conversation and
coordination in the way educational institutions themselves are
structured in the face of increasing uncertainty. It examines the impact
of uncertainty on their structures and adoption of technology, and the
consequences of this on their essential role in nurturing conversation.</p>

<h3>Part 2: Science, Technology and Dialogue {#part-2-science-technology-and-dialogue .unnumbered}<a class="headerlink" href="#part-2-science-technology-and-dialogue-part-2-science-technology-and-dialogue-unnumbered" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Part 2 asks what an ‘institution for uncertain science’ might look like.
It begins by describing the scientific uncertainties of the 20^th^
century, with which it argues that the organisation of education is
out-of-step. Technology, whilst being a tool for investigating
uncertainty through calculating probability, whose use now dominates
every domain of scientific research, has been appropriated by
institutions as a means of mitigating uncertainty. Chapter 6 argues that
increased openness in scientific communication is necessary as a means
of managing a science that demands uncertainty is communicated, and that
at the heart of a coherent ‘uncertain science’ are issues of trust and
social coordination. In chapter 7, new decentralised technologies are
discussed with regard to how they might help with the coordination of
uncertainty in both science and education. The purpose of this
discussion is not to promote a new technological direction (although
this may happen), but to highlight that our current configuration of
hierarchical institutional organisation and technological implementation
is not the only way forwards.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="part-3-ecology-human-exchange-and-higher-learning-part-3-ecology-human-exchange-and-higher-learning-unnumbered">
<h3>Part 3: Ecology, Human Exchange and Higher Learning {#part-3-ecology-human-exchange-and-higher-learning .unnumbered}<a class="headerlink" href="#part-3-ecology-human-exchange-and-higher-learning-part-3-ecology-human-exchange-and-higher-learning-unnumbered" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Part 3 is about the large-scale picture of education - whether a
coordination of human intelligence and technology can create a world
which makes better decisions for the planet, which deals with
socio-economic inequality and injustice, and which provides a context
for conversation where every world citizen is able to realise the
potential of their intellect. It considers three dimensions to this
challenge: ecology and human decision, human exchange and generosity,
and higher learning itself. Chapter 8 emphasises the need for collective
intelligence and the connection between knowledge and decision. Recent
cybernetic analysis of ecology both in the life sciences and academic
discourse are introduced as potential lines of scientific inquiry.
Chapter 9 considers the central conflict between human generosity in
educational acts, and the nature of monetary codification of education,
and more practical economic demands of society (for example, the need to
pay teachers). It argues for an educational ‘meta-economics’ to
coordinate this conflict with society’s uncertainty. Chapter 10 concerns
the nature of ‘higher learning’ and emotional security in the context of
the educational journey from birth. In addressing questions such as why
individuals crave academic status, certificates, publications or
celebrity, the chapter appeals for a deeper understanding of the
dynamics of human relations, drawing on attachment theory and
psychoanalysis.</p>

<h3>Part 4: Steps to a Better Education {#part-4-steps-to-a-better-education .unnumbered}<a class="headerlink" href="#part-4-steps-to-a-better-education-part-4-steps-to-a-better-education-unnumbered" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Utopian thoughts about education are one thing, but taking coherent
practical steps to making things better is quite another. Part 4 draws
together the tools and techniques used elsewhere in the book and appeals
for a renewed focus on a ‘science of education’ which is analytical,
focusing on education’s generative mechanisms, and in particular, the
processes which give rise to problems within the education system and
society. Chapter 11 deals with the problems that divide scholars of
higher education, and ways in which the often tribal divisions between
functionalist, phenomenological and critical approches to education
might be addressed. Chapter 12 frames this in the light of work by
psychotherapist Marion Milner in her book “The Human Problem in Schools”
[&#64;milner_human_2018]. Dealing with the ‘human problem of university’ -
particularly in a world of technologically-generated uncertainty - lies
at the heart of a cybernetic approach to education.</p>

<h2>Whole System Intervention in Education: A Story from Vladivostok {#whole-system-intervention-in-education-a-story-from-vladivostok .unnumbered}<a class="headerlink" href="#whole-system-intervention-in-education-a-story-from-vladivostok-whole-system-intervention-in-education-a-story-from-vladivostok-unnumbered" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When we design an educational intervention, we ask basic questions like
“what is the curriculum?” “what are the learning outcomes?” “what are
the assessment criteria?” and so on. Increasingly today, we also have to
ask “what is the market for this?” “how will it be resourced and
managed?” or “what technologies do we need?” Such questions are framed
by the expectations of people in today’s educational institutions. But
will we be asking the same kinds of questions about education in the
future? This book is an attempt to address a different set of questions
which arise from conceiving education as a whole: a system of citizens
who learn, teach and care for each other in an increasingly
technological social context. This is the world that we have today, and
it is very different from the world that gave birth to our universities.</p>
<p>Seeing anything whole means that we don’t divide it up into categories
and attempt to make connections between its parts. Instead we consider
the central question of how the coherence of a whole is maintained. That
means asking challenging questions. Each chapter of this book asks a
challenging question, and all of these questions lie somewhere behind
everything we do in education. In addressing each of these questions,
our conclusions lead us to educational designs which diverge from
today’s status quo. So rather than see an educational institution made
up of students, teachers and managers, courses, certificates and
assessments, we see a coherent whole made up of people, many of whom
have conversations with each other as they engage in education, live in
families, participate in economies and form a society.</p>
<p>This introduction describes how this basic desire to enhance the
conversation between different people in different roles was the
fundamental objective of a module design called “Global Scientific
Dialogue” which was created in Vladivostok, Russia, at the Far Eastern
Federal University’s Management school in 2018. Although we still had to
address questions about learning outcomes and assessment criteria, the
value of the fundamental questions posed by this book was that all of
the traditional constitutuents of a ‘module’ were reconceived as we
attempted to design assessment to measure student understanding, how to
create the conditions of conversation, or how to overcome the
constraints of the timetable.</p>
<p>Before describing the ways in which the basic educational categories
were re-conceived, it is useful as an introduction to this intervention,
and as an introduction to the book, to describe the questions that gave
rise to it. Each question relates to the main thrust of each chapter,
and so (with 12 chapters) we have 12 questions:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p><strong>What are we about in education? (Chapter 1)</strong><br />
This is a fundamental question to ask before embarking on any
educational project because it demands the identification of the
meaning of what we do. When defining anything, there is always
uncertainty because definitions are context-dependent and often
subjective. How is this uncertainty managed? The question disrupts
conventional ways of managing uncertainty, and opens the door to new
conversations and new thinking.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Why does conversation matter? (Chapter 2)</strong><br />
Question 1 leads directly to the necessity for conversation.
Conversation is a process of producing distinctions through
negotiating the differences between one person’s ideas and
another’s. The fact that each of us have different ideas and some
uncertainty about them is the driver for conversation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Do you learn ‘subjects’ and ‘skills’ or do you learn <em>about</em> other
people (including your teachers)? (Chapter 3)</strong><br />
Most people think we learn ‘stuff’ in school: maths, geography,
woodwork, etc. But if distinctions are uncertain, and conversation
necessary, then if follows that our distinctions are embedded in our
human relations to each other, and that what we learn, we learn
<em>about</em> each other.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Since there are usually more students than teachers, how should
conversations be organised? (Chapter 4)</strong><br />
Institutional hierarchies solve the problem of “one teacher - many
students” with timetables, curricula and assessments. But the
organisation of conversation can be achieved by looking at the
‘whole system’ of education and technology and exploring new ways in
which uncertainty might be managed. Technology may used to catalyse
conversation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What new knowledge and skill will we need for the future?
(Chapter 5)</strong><br />
Thinking about ‘whole systems’ becomes more important as science and
technology introduce new uncertainties. The world that today’s
students will enter will be very different from the world which
produced today’s curricula. In this technological environment, what
do our young people need to know in order to flourish in this new
world, and how should their learning about it be organised?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>How ‘open’ are you about what you don’t understand? (Chapter 6)</strong><br />
In an uncertain world, it is strange that many political leaders
remain confident that they have ‘the answer’ - even in the face of
obvious errors of understanding. Maintaining and expressing
uncertainty is critically important to maintain coherence of
understanding, and this entails a deeper transformation in our
desire to be ‘right.’</p></li>
<li><p><strong>How might we use technology to catalyse conversation and establish
trusted relations? (Chapter 7)</strong><br />
Technology introduces many possibilities for social transformation,
but carries many risks of negative consequences. Yet technology
provides, at the very least, new things to talk about where
individuals have new opportunities to reveal their uncertainties to
one another. Openness about uncertainty is essential for the
establishment of trust.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What is the point of being highly knowledgeable if society
continues to make bad decisions? (Chapter 8)</strong><br />
Another way of expressing this question is to ask, “How can many
brains think as one brain?” When knowledge is seen as a property of
an individual which relates to their social status and power,
decisions about important things can be taken in the light of
selfish ambition rather than collective benefit. To see knowledge as
a result of conversational processes and uncertainty, however, can
reveal new ways in which we might learn to work together in a more
ecological way.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>How do we strike a balance between abundance and scarcity?
(Chapter 9)</strong><br />
In any whole system, there remain closed boundaries which determine
that some things are scarce or functionally distinct. In a society,
not everyone is good at the same things, and it is useful to know
who can do what. Educational assessment is one way of doing this,
but it can also lead to ‘artificial’ scarcity which can create
social inequality and drive a ‘market’ in education. Teaching,
however, is often a generous activity where the instinct to teach is
to pass on wisdom for the future flourishing of the species.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>How can we help each other to feel safe in the world?
(Chapter 10)</strong><br />
Many parents worry about their children’s education because they
believe that education is a guarantee of security. Increasingly,
however, it seems that for many the attainment of a university
certificate is of declining benefit. Yet beyond the acquisition of
status and high income, there are features of ‘higher learning’
which can lead to increased flexibility to deal with environmental
challenges in society, or even to what Jungian psychoanalysts call
‘individuation.’ However, these attributes whilst sometimes
developed within the confines of traditional institutions, may
equally be acquired throughout life in other ways.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>How can we guard against tribalism? (Chapter 11)</strong><br />
The flip-side of security is tribalism. ‘Tribes’ are characterised
by collective security within particular exclusive contexts.
However, if security in the future requires increasing flexibility
of response, then the embrace of ideas that challenge assumptions
and the status quo is essential. When studying education,
researchers need to find ways of making connections between their
findings, even when they come from different perspectives.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>How can human problems be solved? (Chapter 12)</strong><br />
Human problems can be made worse by treating them as technical
problems. Technical problems have technical solutions, but human
problems arise from struggles with uncertainty, openness and
conversation. Technologies may, however, provide a context for
richer, and perhaps therapeutic, conversations.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>To design a new kind of educational experience from these questions
requires starting from the first question and moving through to address
the others. The core of questions 1 - 3 is ‘conversation.’ So
conversation, or (perhaps preferably, dialogue) needs to be at the heart
of whatever we do. To paraphrase a recent UK government report, it is
not “students at the heart of the system” [&#64;willetts_higher_2011]; it is
dialogue.</p>
<p>The Global Scientific Dialogue module was intended as a conversational
opportunity to develop teachers in encouraging them to be more open and
dialogical with their students, and to get students to talk about
current and emerging topics in science and technology which were missing
from the curriculum. The questions above were used as design principles
which prompted teachers, students and managers to become more focused on
the conversations they have with each other, and to address the
challenges of organising those conversations better.</p>
<p>The traditional constitution of education does not always promote
conversation. Instead, students often sit in steeped seating in lecture
halls and listen to a teacher talk for an hour or so. This book is
partly about explaining why this model has been so persistent despite
its obvious inadequacies. In having an explanation as to why there is a
lack of conversation, we can also find a remedy to address it.</p>
<p>The main argument of this book is that the root cause of lack of
conversation is uncertainty, or rather the failure to manage
uncertainty. This is articulated in Chapters 1 - 4, where it is argued
that because uncertainty causes both individuals and institutions to
seek to defend their identities, they create and uphold distinctions
about who they are, their role, what they know, what they don’t know,
how important they are and then seek, by various means including
technology and status, to defend themselves. Chapter 4 explains how
uncertainty is both the cause and the result of this process: we are in
a positive feedback loop with uncertainty.</p>
<p>In Vladivostok, we began by seeing each person, whether teacher, learner
or manager, as a coherent whole who must manage their uncertainty. In
Chapter 5, I introduce a diagrammatic way of thinking about wholes. You
might imagine drawing a ‘whole’ as a big circle which contains
everything you might want it to contain. But there’s always something
outside the circle which is excluded. What is excluded creates some
undecidability (“is it in or is it out?”) <em>within</em> the whole. This
undecidability, or ‘uncertainty’ is like a ‘hole’ within the whole - and
it needs managing. But it can’t be managed within the whole; it requires
something outside the whole to manage it. This is called a ‘metasystem.’
All wholes, whether a whole institution, a whole person, a whole
society, or a whole scientific discipline, contain uncertainty which
requires a metasystem to manage. All wholes have a ‘hole.’ So it looks a
bit like this:</p>
<p><img alt="Whole system, metasystem anduncertainty" src="_images/wholesystem.jpg" />{width=”\textwidth”}</p>
<p>The coherence of any person, whether they are a teacher, learner or
manager, or equally the coherence of any institution, relies on a
metasystem to maintain its coherence. The Vladivostok educational
approach recognised a fundamental component of the theory of this book:
holistic thinking requires thinking about the metasystem which maintains
the whole. If the metasystem cannot manage the system’s uncertainty then
there will emerge barriers to conversation, or to put it another way,
barriers to the system’s mechanisms for maintaining coherence within
itself. I will argue in the following pages that this is the state of
modern education: a metasystem working in overdrive to maintain
coherence in a system whose uncertainties are increasing. In order to
deal with this, we have to create the conditions for dialogue, which is
the system’s mechanism for managing its own uncertainty. But to open up
dialogue between students, teachers and managers in Vladivostok, it was
necessary to disrupt the existing metasystem. In order to do this most
efficiently, it was decided to do it intensively: Global Scientific
Dialogue was a module designed to run in a concentrated two-week period,
like a conference.</p>

<h3>Distinctions and Curriculum {#distinctions-and-curriculum .unnumbered}<a class="headerlink" href="#distinctions-and-curriculum-distinctions-and-curriculum-unnumbered" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The objective of the disruption was not simply to disorient the people
in the system. Somehow the metasystem of each person had to be disrupted
in a way where it <em>expressed</em> the uncertainty it was trying to manage
rather than create new ways of containing it. Uncertainty could be
expressed through shared activities and discussion and it was hoped that
through this process, new means of interpersonal coordination could be
found which transcended existing categories of understanding, the
curriculum, or job roles.</p>
<p>While many of the existing personal metasystemic functions - in both
teachers and learners - use subjects on the curriculum as a way of
mopping-up uncertainty (e.g. “I’m an
economist/accountant/biologist/etc”), at the interface between quantum
mechanics, biology and consciousness, just as much as at the boundary
between technology and communication, curriculum distinctions become
much harder to draw. When faced with emerging evidence from quantum
biology, or the potential of artificial intelligence, or the ambiguities
of aesthetic experience the traditional metasystemic distinctions about
curriculum, modules, certificates, publication and status break down.
Moreover, it is hardly difficult to point to the fast-changing world
outside the academy to suggest that traditional curriculum distinctions
no longer work. This provided a schema for metasystemic disruptions
organised in particular areas: those around undecidables in science,
technology, communication and creativity. To create a schema of unknown
or undecidable questions provided a framework for encouraging the
opening-up of each individual metasystem to articulate different aspects
of uncertainty. This was powerful because it also addressed fundamental
uncertainties relating to the different disciplines that were
represented on the course, from economics to biology.</p>

<h3>Organising Conversation {#organising-conversation .unnumbered}<a class="headerlink" href="#organising-conversation-organising-conversation-unnumbered" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Chapters 2 and 3 introduce conversation as a means by which differences
between the distinctions that individuals make are negotiated. Chapter 2
discusses the way that conversation involves the coordination of
multiple descriptions of the same thing (what is termed ‘redundancy’),
and chapter 3 discusses how this conversational process forms the basis
by which individuals ‘tune-in’ to understand one another. The tuning-in
process (a phrase used by sociologist Alfred Schutz to describe what he
called ‘intersubjectivity’), is - it is argued - a process of revealing
and negotiating the uncertainties between each individual.</p>
<p>In Vladivostok, the desire that individuals should express their
uncertainty to each other in the light of whatever disruptions they were
subject to, required that situations that facilitated conversation were
coordinated. With a large number of students (200) this also creates an
organisational challenge: the fundamental problem of any educational
intervention is the asymmetry between the number of students and the
number of teachers.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 discusses how this organisational challenge has the same
structure to that of any ‘whole system,’ whether it is a whole person,
or a whole community: there is a system with specific operations (like
managing conversation), and this system produces uncertainty which
requires a metasystem to address. The organisational uncertainty in
Vladivostok arose from the problem that students needed to be
coordinated in small conversational groups, and that each conversational
group needed to be ‘disrupted’ in similar ways, and that there needed to
be a mechanism which brought cohesion to the experience, including a
means of assessment.</p>
<p>Technology provided some assistance is addressing this. Video was used
as a way of standardising the ‘metasystemic disruption’: these were
video ‘lesson plans,’ which teachers could use as a guide for
coordinating activities and stimulating discussion among small groups of
students. The videos contained clips taken from YouTube and other
sources, which presented snippets of current thinking in science and the
arts. The experience of watching them was intended to be a bit like
channel-surfing, or browsing curated links on the internet. These
collections of resources were then used to contextualise a set of
activities which the students had to work on in small groups to discuss
specific problems. The desire was to make the classroom a bit like the
internet.</p>

<h3>Intersubjectivity {#intersubjectivity .unnumbered}<a class="headerlink" href="#intersubjectivity-intersubjectivity-unnumbered" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The videos and the activities undertaken by the students were designed
to encourage the making of connections between categories of
understanding and individuals. Whether in drawing pictures in response
to music, or establishing a political plan to deal with artificial
intelligence in a dystopian future, or to describe patterns that
connected or distinguished natural and artificial objects, learners were
encouraged to articulate their distinctions and uncertainties with each
other. In each case, what was learned was more than any specific details
of learning content. What was gained was the learners’ understanding of
their peers, and the uncertainties which they shared.</p>
<p>Students had to be creative in the way they reported their discussions.
Many groups created videos, used pictures and sometimes drama or dance
to present their findings. Each of these artifacts was collected as part
of the course’s assessment strategy which used a ‘patchwork text’
approach [&#64;scoggins_patchwork_1999]. This method allowed for the
articulation of rich ‘thick descriptions’ of understanding that embraced
new media, where issues of individual doubt, group disagreement, and
differences of interpretation were all exposed, prompting further
discussion and reflection among the students.</p>

<div class="section" id="uncertainty-and-technology-uncertainty-and-technology-unnumbered">
<h3>Uncertainty and Technology {#uncertainty-and-technology .unnumbered}<a class="headerlink" href="#uncertainty-and-technology-uncertainty-and-technology-unnumbered" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Part of the rationale for Global Scientific Dialogue was the need to
expose students to the fast-changing technologies which were likely to
impact their working lives. Technology was central to the course, both
as part of the mechanism underpinning its coordination, and as part of
its content. However, the confusion about technology is particularly
important, and this confusion was used as a way of stimulating
discussion. In Chapter 6, the role of technology in producing and
communicating uncertainty is presented in a simple way arguing that
technology can be seen to do three things:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>It provides new options for individuals to do things which could
have been done before (often through institutions). As a result,
technology increases uncertainty by making it harder to choose how
to which option to select, and by disrupting established
institutions;</p></li>
<li><p>It attenuates reality through restrictive interfaces (e.g. forms)
and selective data collection;</p></li>
<li><p>It amplifies representations of the world which it stores as data,
in the form of videos, visualisations, computer-generated artifacts,
games and simulations.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The use of technology on the course presented individuals with the vast
choices which they have available for self-expression. At the same time,
many of the means of expression articulate uncertainty and ambiguity
(particularly video) which (it is argued in Chapter 6) as a means of
revealing uncertainty can help manage it. Technologies afford the
opportunity for each individual to express the dimensions of their
uncertainty: as a result others can coordinate their expressions of
uncertainty and create new foundations for conversation.</p>
<p>Technology was particularly valuable among the teachers and managers
involved in the course. The use of social software among teachers
resulted in the sharing of artefacts online which were then a spur to
conversations in the corridor (for example, “did you see the photo of my
students’ presentation?”). This also had the benefit of transparency
with management, as well as providing an early-warning of when things
might be going wrong.</p>
<p>Technology can make education more dialogical. By ‘amplifying
representations of the world,’ technology can provide more options and
opportunities for individuals to make utterances with each other. In
other words, it becomes a context for conversation (for example, “have
you seen this webpage?”) - in much the same way as the traditional
curriculum provides contexts such as “now we are going to talk about
physics.” The advantage of technological coordination of conversation is
that it works within and across the context of existing friendships,
personal interests, professional roles, across departments, or creates
artefacts that prompt new personal connections. Conversations need not
be hierarchically organised: they can be organised <em>heterarchically</em>
with technology.</p>

<h3>Science as Disruption {#science-as-disruption .unnumbered}<a class="headerlink" href="#science-as-disruption-science-as-disruption-unnumbered" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Chapter 6 discusses how modern science and technology is characterised
by uncertainty, whether it is through the increased use of probabilities
for the establishment of empirical results, or the fundamental embrace
of uncertainty in quantum mechanics. Modern science’s uncertainty
provided a foundation for disruption by asking fundamental scientific
questions to which nobody knows the answer. Global Scientific Dialogue
exploited scientific uncertainty as a way of flattening the relations
between teachers and learners and to drive conversation and inquiry: in
this environment, teachers could not adopt the position of ‘experts,’
but rather as participants and facilitators of inquiry.</p>
<p>This connection between institutional structure, scientific
communication, pedagogical practice and scientific development is
addressed in Part 2 of the book. In Vladivostok, some coordination
around specific scientific questions was needed, and this was provided
both in the resources produced for the video lesson plans, and in the
design of a technologically-coordinated reading activity for the
students.</p>
<p>Students were asked to make comparisons between documents which
discussed key issues around the scientific topics of the course. The
activity used a ‘comparative judgement’ technique to ask students to
identify which of a pair of documents selected at random they found most
interesting and why (see Figure <a class="reference external" href="#ref:compjudge">1</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”ref:compjudge”}). The activity was designed to encourage
students to read in a critical way, whilst contributing to data that
could inform them of what they were really interested in, what others
were interested in, and what the grounds for future individual
development and conversation might be. The resources for this
technological activity were partly derived from sections of this book,
together with sections of text that were produced by staff in the
university as part of the course development.</p>

<h3>Openness {#openness .unnumbered}<a class="headerlink" href="#openness-openness-unnumbered" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Chapter 7 addresses some of the issues around open education,
self-publishing and educational resources. Since part of this book was
repurposed to form the basis of the comparative judgement activity on
the course, a rationale for self-publishing as a means of flexible
repurposing of resources to create new kinds of activity was tied-up
with Global Scientific Dialogue’s design. Chapter 7 explores the
organisational dynamics between publishers and universities, and
articulates how the dynamic relationship between publishing and
institutions can be changed through open practices. The arguments for
doing this are not only about the provision of free resources or even
the expression of uncertainty (although this is important), but
explicitly address this kind of re-use of material to transform
pedagogical organisation and learner engagement. Technology’s capacity
to generate multiple descriptions of the world can be further exploited
to drive new activities, and openness is a pre-requisite to creating
these opportunities.</p>
<p>In Vladivostok, the question about future scientific knowledge and skill
focused on the students’ dialogical expression of their understanding
using many different forms of media. Supported by the “patchwork text”
assessment technique, students could make videos, take photographs, and
convey the spirit of the conversations they had. In this process, there
was much that students learnt about each other, and indeed, there was
much that teachers learnt about their students, and vice-versa. The
content of learning was embodied in the people who spoke about the
content.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="trust-trust-unnumbered">
<h3>Trust {#trust .unnumbered}<a class="headerlink" href="#trust-trust-unnumbered" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If open publishing and uncertain science are embraced, what happens to
issues of trust and truth in science? How is scientific authority
maintained? Chapter 7 argues that these issues too are institutional and
organisational in nature. With traditional forms of hierarchical
organisation, the trustworthiness of knowledge and expertise relies on
declarations by institutions of the status of individual experts, or
community recognition of certain facts. In a world of uncertain science,
and particularly a world of ‘fake news,’ the status of the expert has
been called into question.</p>
<p>Among recent technological approaches which are looking to new ways of
organising human trust relationships, Blockchain and AI are both tools
which are exploring how human transactions may be stored in a
decentralised and heterarchical way, free of the impositions of
hierarchy. Clever though these technologies are, the nature of trust as
an intersubjective phenomenon was something that formed a central pillar
in the course. Face-to-face engagement, with other students, teachers
and with experts was a critical element in the establishment of trust in
knowledge and in each other.</p>
<p>In Vladivostok an ‘experts day’ was organised featuring practitioners
from a range of different disciplines. Experts sat dispersed in a large
room, and students were free to move from person to person. The
objective was to encourage students to listen to personal stories of
scientific and artistic accomplishment which were outside their subject
areas. In meeting and talking to these people, the inter-subjective
process of engagement produced surprising results: a number of students
spoke of being transformed by the experience. Experts spoke frankly
about their domains providing authentic and raw insights. If students
didn’t trust these experts, why would they have been affected by what
they said?</p>
<p>Technology does however, provide methods of corroboration. Students
consulted the internet in the light of their encounters. It is an
interesting question as to whether they would have changed their minds
had the internet contradicted what they had been told by the experts.
Chapter 7 considers that the issue of trust is both fundamental to
education and science, but sits in between intersubjective engagement
and artefacts such as websites and books, discussions or even
Blockchains. It is in education where these competing forces play out,
and the Global Scientific Dialogue ‘expert’s day’ presented a vehicle
for exploring this.</p>

<div class="section" id="decision-decision-unnumbered">
<h3>Decision {#decision .unnumbered}<a class="headerlink" href="#decision-decision-unnumbered" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Chapter 8 addresses the challenge of the coordination of many brains in
attempting to address common problems. At the root of this is the
question of whether many brains can think as one brain, or more
ambitiously, whether ‘university’ could be a coherent global enterprise
of inquiry and learning. This provides another reason for focusing
Global Scientific Dialogue on group activity: societal problems stem
from collective decision, or the challenge of negotiating the
distinction between individual knowledge and understanding and
collective engagement and dialogue. Many of the big issues addressed by
the module, such as global warming, inequality or homelessness, were
specifically issues of failure of collective decision.</p>
<p>Universities as institutions epitomise this decision problem. Cohen and
March [&#64;cohen_garbage_1972], who are discussed in chapter 8, developed
their ‘Garbage can model of organisational decision-making’ by observing
the decision-making process in their own university. They observed that
important issues were presented to committees to decide upon, whereupon
those committees, comprising many individuals with many different
agendas, would sideline important matters in favour of matters to which
a pre-existing solution could be selected from the ‘garbage can’ of
discarded technologies and approaches. It is this very process which can
impede the development of new kinds of educational initiatives such as
‘Global Scientific Dialogue’ itself. Educational transformation
addresses issues which appear too complex, and available discarded
techniques can find more favour with those on the committee who might
either prefer to ‘play it safe’ or to implement something for which they
might gain credit. Many educational technologies find themselves
selected by ‘default’ in this way as more fundamental problems are
pushed aside in the decision-making process.</p>
<p>The Global Scientific Dialogue module itself arose thanks to senior
management backing which bypassed some of the more complex issues of
collective decision-making in the university. This was lucky - but the
problem of collective decision is something that is endemic, and
something for which students entering a world of committees and
corporate infighting are poorly prepared. The importance of
collaborative activity - and particularly the importance of emphasising
collaborative activity with students who might prefer not to engage with
their peers - formed the heart of the pedagogical approach. In many of
the activities, disagreements would arise, and students would have to
find ways of negotiating their differences. Sometimes, activities
revealed aspects of individual bias or even bigotry, and in these
instances, there were opportunities for teachers to make particular
critical interventions. It is worth noting that with a less dialogical
approach, personal bias can find few opportunities to make itself
available for inspection.</p>

<h3>Gifts and Exchanges {#gifts-and-exchanges .unnumbered}<a class="headerlink" href="#gifts-and-exchanges-gifts-and-exchanges-unnumbered" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Dialogue for collective decision requires students and teachers to
become more open and generous in their engagements with each other.
Chapter 10 explores generosity in the context of the prevailing economic
climate which has seen increasing financialisation within the education
sector. Yet despite these market pressures, within all universities
there are great teachers who, whilst being paid a salary, nevertheless
give to their students in terms of time or sharing their insights, or
they may give books or other resources for free. “Giving” is one of the
fundamental things that happens in education which makes the system
work. At the same time however, the financialisation process reminds us
that education relies on some form of monetary exchange, without which
teachers and managers could not be paid. This financial exchange, like
most market transactions, relies on the declaration of scarcity of
knowledge and certification. Chapter 10 considers gifts and monetary
exchanges as aspects of transactions in education, and these
transactions are difficult to conceive of in a coherent way. Put most
simply, education sits between exchange of money and giving.</p>
<p>The encouragement to openness on the course was really about encouraging
a generosity of spirit among teachers which avoided any declarations of
‘scarcity’ of knowledge. If fact, by focusing the educational content on
scientific and artistic questions to which nobody knew the answer, there
was no possibility of declaring the scarcity of knowledge. At the same
time, however, if there is no scarcity declaration about the knowledge
within the course, there was still a need to declare that the module
certificate was sufficiently scarce in order for it to have any value
and for the students to be motivated to attend.</p>
<p>The assessment of the course demanded that students presented their
patchwork texts to their peers. By using peer assessment in this way, a
balance could be created between the scarcity of certification declared
by the institution, and the contributions of individuals to the group
through sharing their ideas, or working in teams. The value of each
student’s contribution was a contribution to the understanding of the
whole group. In many cases, even among those students who professed to
dislike the course or who were critical, the creative expression of
their experiences took the form of a gift as well as being an object for
which marks were given. There were poems and videos which expressed both
what individual students enjoyed, and what they disliked.</p>
<p>Chapter 10 explores the connection between giving and exchanging in
education with our current understanding of economics and society. While
the discipline of economics has shaped the institution in its current
financialised form, that discipline has itself relied on gifts and
exchanges through the economic system. Since Global Scientific Dialogue
was a course in a school of economics and management, its pedagogic
practice relates directly to the very mechanisms within which economic
theory and discourse emerges. What would economic theory, and its
knock-on effects on education look like were that theory to have emerged
within a more dialogical context?</p>

<div class="section" id="secure-relations-secure-relations-unnumbered">
<h3>Secure relations {#secure-relations .unnumbered}<a class="headerlink" href="#secure-relations-secure-relations-unnumbered" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Chapter 11 considers the fundamental motivation to enter into higher
learning. Today, it seems that the principal motivation to acquire
educational certificates stems from a desire to remain viable in a world
which is changing fast. Students and their parents think that
certificates provide a certain degree of security. Anxiety about not
having a certificate can be traced back in the biographies of those who
experience it, but it is reinforced by a prevailing narrative about the
importance of education which itself appears out of touch with reality.
In this sense, to be secure in the world means to be in a position where
the narrative each of us carry around with us about ourselves is
validated by the things which happen to us. In this way, attachment to
ideas, people and things like certificates, religions, status symbols
and other people are all reflections of relations to objects and ideas
which have arisen since childhood [&#64;bowlby_secure_2012]. These
narratives belong to the metasystem of each individual, and it was this
metasystem that Global Scientific Dialogue attempted to disrupt.</p>
<p>The course aimed to create a communication environment where the
narratives present in the heads of each individual teacher and student
could be explored, and in some cases revealed to one another. In cases
where these narratives exhibited uncomfortable issues, or they revealed
attitudes to education which denied the significance of the contribution
of others, there was scope for teachers, or other students, to intervene
sensitively. The purpose of the course was to create the conditions
where individuals could organise their own uncertainty management.</p>
<p>In each case - even in the exceptional cases where biased positions
which were socially unacceptable were apparent - personal opinions were
assumed to derive from the desire of each individual to be safe. It was
for teachers or peers to suggest alternative ways to feel safe, or that
a chosen narrative would not deliver the safety that a student might
believe it would.</p>
<p>Chapter 10 argues this is a fundamental principle of higher education:
that the purpose of higher learning is to increase in flexibility the
ways one is able to look at the world. It entails the generation of many
possible descriptions of the world, thereby providing the necessary
adaptive capabilities to absorb the complexity of modern life. By this
route, material or fixed objects - such as status symbols, money, books,
webpages, philosophies, articles of faith and so on, are not objects of
attachment, but become means of generating new descriptions of the
world. The creative processes of the education in Vladivostok were
precisely designed to stimulate and disturb fundamental structures of
attachment.</p>

<p>Part 4 of the book is about making education better. So was the Global
Scientific Dialogue course ‘better education?’ I do not want to say
this, except to say that the Vladivostok experiment had three specific
objectives:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>to encourage greater collegiality and creativity among teachers and
students;</p></li>
<li><p>to introduce students and teachers to technological changes to the
world which students would face when they leave;</p></li>
<li><p>to drive conversation about the future, and to encourage an active
and exploratory approach to its investigation.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I could say that it was evident from what unfolded that all three of
these things took place. But this is <em>my</em> claim as someone who has
written a book about the underlying theoretical principles of the course
design, and perhaps (although I’m not) wanting to claim that this way is
a ‘better’ way in education. If I did this, I invite myself to attack
from anyone who might object strongly, or who has a better or different
idea. From there, we arrive at a kind of ‘tribalism’ in educational
research, which is the focus of chapter 11.</p>
<p>I don’t want to claim Global Scientific Dialogue as anything more than
interesting and often enjoyable for many of the people involved in it. I
should also say that not all the students enjoyed it. Some very bright
students complained that it was “too much like kindergarten” or that the
“content lacked depth” - and these are important criticisms. However, I
do want to argue that to improve education, we have to change the way it
is organised and the way conversations are coordinated.</p>
<p>This is the only justification for the upheaval to the status quo, the
elaborate technologies, the retraining of teachers and the disruption of
students. The reason why we shouldn’t ‘just do what we have always done’
is that if we want better education, we should examine its organisation.
This includes examining the ways that educational research, within which
different ways of organising education are proposed, is itself
organised. This is the most challenging aspect of my book, because it is
where a work of educational theory and practice has to engage with the
dynamics of the discourse within which it seeks to establish itself.</p>
<p>My argument is that the systems theoretical approach advanced in this
book can transcend some of the divisions which define the different
‘tribes’ in educational research. For example, between the positions of
critical and humanistic scholars of education and those academics (often
learning technologists) who seek to solve the human problems of
education with technical wizardry. In Vladivostok, the approach was to
deal with the human problems of education through dialogue, and to
exploit technologies in transforming the organisational context within
which this could be facilitated. ‘Transcending’ means attempting to
establish a common language (or more specifically, a ‘meta-language’),
which can help articulate the processes by which one research
perspective sees itself as ‘phenomenological’ and another as
‘functionalist.’ The human problem of research into education is
directly related to the human problem of education itself.</p>
<p>Chapter 12 concerns the specific human problems of education. Drawing on
Marion Milner’s neglected psychoanalytic work from the 1930s on the
“Human Problem in School” [&#64;milner_human_2018], it highlights the
importance of balancing the ‘inner’ uncertainty of psychic experience
with the ‘outer’ uncertainty of discourse and the environment.
Technology has deeply affected this psychodynamic balance. How is the
psyche to respond to the increase in environmental uncertainty brought
about through technology’s creation of new options for action? The
response of the traditional institutional hierarchy to this problem is
to use technology to attenuate uncertainty: thus we have learning
analytics, AI, VLEs and increasing surveillance of teachers and
learners. The answer of this book, and the answer explored in
Vladovistok is that we can address technology’s uncertainty by engaging
each other in dialogue. Vladivostok showed that technology can be
exploited to facilitate this dialogical process at scale.</p>
<p>My journey in writing this book has involved a gradual ‘letting-go’ of
the formal means by which educational systems see themselves: the
curriculum, certificates, the status of institutions, professors,
lectures, and so on. With the removal of these ways of thinking about
education, there remains uncertainty.</p>
<p>I do not believe an educational theory gives us answers which explain
phenomena in education. There are no answers. But there are ways in
which powerful questions can be framed. If theory does anything, it
provides a framework – or a language – through which existing
uncertainties can be expressed and shared. A good theory frames powerful
questions which can unlock intellectual inquiry in others and invite
them into a fluid dialogue which does not get caught up in the net of
individual prejudice.</p>
<p>The Vladivostok experiment was an attempt to recover the basic
foundation for any education: the intergenerational engagement by which
society seeks to ensure that it maintains sufficient wisdom not to
destroy itself in the future. It is what parents attempt with their
children, and it is what teachers attempt with their pupils. The
challenges here are not technical, but human. The human challenge of
situating technology such that it helps humans address human problems is
the essence of the role of an educational technologist.</p>

<h1><em><strong>Part 1</strong></em> Cybernetics, Conversation and Education’s distinctions {#part-1-cybernetics-conversation-and-educations-distinctions-1 .unnumbered}<a class="headerlink" href="#part-1-cybernetics-conversation-and-education-s-distinctions-part-1-cybernetics-conversation-and-educations-distinctions-1-unnumbered" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>In public discourse there is no shortage of assertions about education
made by thought-leaders, government ministers, vice-chancellors,
professors of education, journalists, think-tank experts, parents and
students. Rarely do we inspect how the distinctions that underpin these
assertions are made or upheld: educational debates, even among the most
intelligent and experienced commentators, often become ‘tribal’ battles.</p>
<p>Assertions about education sit on sets of distinctions about employment,
knowledge, understanding, the economy, personal identity and hopes and
fears for our children. In Part 1 the relationship between these
distinctions is explored as a way of describing education from the
bottom-up. It is argued that if we can understand how the different
distinctions about education are made, we can understand how to change
them. This study demands a scientific approach, and Part 1 introduces
cybernetics as the science of organisation from whose perspective the
tortured discourse of education can be grasped coherently.</p>
<p>This means that Part 1 of this book has to begin with something quite
abstract: what is the ‘aboutness’ of education? Cybernetics provides a
meta-language for education: a way we can talk about our talk about
education. Chapter 1 begins by exploring the uncertainties around our
distinctions, and the processes which lead to boundaries being
established, whether those distinctions are between disciplines, job
roles, educational status or economic success.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 is about conversation and how technology has changed the way
we understand education. Conversation is presented as a cybernetic
process of coordination where distinctions are created and where they
can be changed. Technologies provide new ways in which conversations can
be coordinated, particularly through rich media like video.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 focuses on the human relations which are formed through
conversation. Through conversation we understand each other, and through
understanding each other, we often learn new things. Computers have
changed the ways we negotiate the in-between-ness of conversation which
is called ‘intersubjectivity.’ The chapter considers intersubjectivity
and its relation to technology: how does the way in which we relate to
each other through social media differ from the way we relate to each
other face-to-face?</p>
<p>Finally, institutional structures exist in the way they do because of
conversations within institutions about educational processes. The
context of the institutional conversation is a world which has been
transformed by technology. Ancient institutional structures and
practices like libraries, lectures, exams and timetables have to
co-exist with a world where individuals have a vastly increased range of
options for accessing resources, talking to friends, publishing work,
creating multimedia, and creating and participating in learning
communities. With this increase in options - both for students and staff</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>comes uncertainty: teachers now ask “how should we coordinate our
work-based students?” “how can we increase student retention?” “how can
we stop students cheating?” and so on. Chapter 4 introduces the idea
that with increased technological uncertainty comes institutional
attempts to maintain existing hierarchical structures. With cybernetic
models, I argue this attempt will fail. A new approach to organisation
is required, and we need cybernetic thinking to realise it.</p></li>

<h2>Coherence and Uncertainty<a class="headerlink" href="#coherence-and-uncertainty" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Educational practice has been remarkably resilient in the face of
continued social, political and technological change. In the wake of the
industrial revolution, education expanded the grammar schools to teach
children the skills of the new industrial age. In the wake of the
computer revolution, education has adopted electronic communication
tools to reinforce its existing practices. Yet deep uncertainty about
education remains, alongside confusion about technology. In the midst of
massive social, scientific and technological transformation, how does
education manage to hold itself together? How do we agree what education
is about?</p>
<p>One answer to this is that we simply suppress the uncertainty. The
freedom to admit uncertainty, or discuss and scientifically investigate
it disappears the further one goes down the corridors of power. Although
students have the privilege of saying “I don’t understand,” the
Vice-Chancellor or the education minister or the professor of education
is often required to admit no confusion. Few academics want to look
uncertain on the podium. Yet education is, if nothing else, about
talking about uncertainty: the exploration of different peoples’
understanding of important things. So has education survived by avoiding
the very thing which it was set up to do?</p>
<p>Historically, one of the principal functions of all institutions -
universities, schools, hospitals, churches, law courts or government -
is to manage society’s uncertainty. Institutions are tasked with the job
of providing, as Ulrich Beck notes, “certainty and security through
knowledge of the future in the face of uncertainty as a basic condition
of human knowledge” [&#64;beck_world_2009]</p>
<p>Education absorbs the uncertainties of human learning, hospitals absorb
the uncertainties of mortality and disease, the law absorbs the
uncertainty of justice, government absorbs the uncertainty of social
equity, and religion absorbs the uncertainties of existence. Yet these
institutions emerged in a different kind of world, when the relationship
between the hierarchical social order and the uncertainties of life
appeared to be stable. The computer has changed all that.</p>
<p>Science too absorbs uncertainty. Our conventional understanding of
science is that it concerns itself with fact, certainty and prediction.
This conventional understanding is impressed upon us through education.
Physics, chemistry and maths in the classroom was instilled in us
through a regime of repetitious performances which culminated in
examinations. Few of us have had the privilege to encounter the kind of
real scientists whose work found its way on to the curriculum. Fewer
still had access to them as <em>people</em> with their foibles, egos, doubts,
confusion, failed attempts and conviction in the face of adversity.
School teaches us that to be scientific is to succeed within the regime
of school science. It does not tell us that to be scientific is to be
<em>like</em> a scientist.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-cybernetic-lens">
<h2>A Cybernetic Lens<a class="headerlink" href="#a-cybernetic-lens" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A ‘cybernetic lens’ is a way of thinking about uncertainty which helps
us to map its dimensions at multiple levels. The word ‘cybernetics’
comes from the Greek word, Kybernetes, which refers to the steersman on
a Greek ship. The latin form of the word is ‘gubernator,’ from which we
get ‘governor,’ ‘government,’ ‘governance.’ All of these things refer to
processes of coordination, organisation and steering.</p>
<p>Therefore we can say that cybernetics is a science of coordination. It
provides tools to understand complexity - whether it is at the level of
the human body, the beehive, a university, a society, or the planet.
Uncertainty is a fundamental parameter in the analysis of organisation -
a consequence of the <em>variety</em> of options available in a system’s
behaviour and our capacity to absorb them. The world is uncertain
because it has so much variety which we cannot absorb. To grasp the
variety of options is also to measure the uncertainty in an observer
trying to predict how that system will behave. In a world of highly
complex technologies each of which have millions of possible uses and
with which people behave in increasingly complex ways, we can at least
be certain that uncertainty is increasing.</p>
<p>Cybernetics presents many descriptions of itself. It is ‘the science of
communication and control in man and machine’
[&#64;wiener_cybernetics:_2013], or ‘the art and science of making
defensible metaphors’ [&#64;pask_cybernetics_1975], or ‘the science of
effective organisation’ [&#64;beer_cybernetics_1965] or ‘a way of thinking’
or ‘a way of thinking about ways of thinking, of which it is one.’ Its
structure as a subject embraces ‘multiple description’ as an operating
principle - even as a principle in describing itself.</p>
<p>Cybernetics is also a practical subject. There is a body of practice
which marks out cybernetics as a distinct kind of activity.
Cyberneticians draw diagrams with boxes and lines connecting them, they
make machines, program computers, compose music, invent novel ways of
teaching, write philosophy, reorganise businesses, make art, investigate
cultures, conduct psychotherapy, explore new ways of communicating and
campaign for world peace. Many of them do many of these things and view
their diverse activities through a consistent theoretical lens. Their
activities overlap with activities in the various disciplines
circumscribed by education: engineering, physics, anthropology,
psychology, music, art and education. The difference is that
cyberneticians do not see the distinctions between the traditional
disciplines. Their activities always take them <em>across</em> disciplines. As
a field of activity, it is able to do this because it distils the
traditional distinctions between disciplines into a fundamental question
about organisation.</p>
<p>Disciplines are organised bodies of knowledge and practices. Educational
institutions are similarly organised according to disciplines. To
inquire into the nature of organisation itself is to dissolve
distinctions, but this is not just an exercise of epistemology; it
affects the practicalities of how we conceive of the social constitution
of education. To do this, we require a deeper set of distinctions about
organisation. Indeed it requires some basic distinctions about how
distinctions are made: <em>it is to ask about the aboutness of education</em>.
This is the intellectual territory of the cybernetician. It is to enter
into a deep inquiry about distinctions about organisations which produce
distinctions. To enter into this inquiry is to unsettle the distinctions
that many of us have grown up with about what education is, what it is
for, and how to make it better.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-discipline-of-education">
<h2>The Discipline of Education<a class="headerlink" href="#the-discipline-of-education" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The topic of education itself is not of the same kind as the topics of
physics, maths or chemistry. Sociologist Everett Hughes argued that
education was not a discipline but rather “a major complex of arts”:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“[Education is not a discipline] in the sense of offering a single
order of phenomena which, when observed and/or manipulated in a
systematic way, yield a body of consistent theory. In this respect,
education is like the other great practical arts - looking after the
sick, keeping order, and distributing justice. All of them, however,
give rise to a variety of disciplines and, in turn, use many of their
results. These arts are the very springs of human curiosity; they are
also great consumers of man’s best intellectual and scientific
efforts. None of these arts, moreover, is ever completely under the
control of the human will, the will of one man or of some small group
of men, or even of society at large through its instruments. Yet
control over these arts is sought in all societies. The manner of
practicing them is the very stuff of the clash of wills and interests;
thus, the stuff of politics.”[&#64;hughes_sociological_1985 408]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Hughes’s distinction between a ‘discipline’ and a ‘complex of arts’ is
helpful in the sense that it causes us to ask whether there is a ‘body
of consistent theory’ about education, or educational technology,
arising from systematic study. The answer in both cases is “No.” Of
course, there are theories, but they are not consistent and cannot
systematically explain or predict the complex phenomena of education:
the gap between theory and practice remains unresolved and often
overlooked even in the most prestigious education journals.</p>
<p>Hughes’s comment is interesting because it highlights the fundamental
intellectual activity of attempting to make sense of any phenomenon: the
requirement to make a <em>distinction</em>. That a distinction can be drawn
between ‘<em>a discipline</em>’ and ‘<em>a complex of arts</em>’ is the critical
point: Hughes draws the boundary and the distinction defended with
evidence and illustrative examples. But where do we study the
distinction-making process itself?</p>
<p>Distinction-making itself can be a topic for scientific inquiry.
Cybernetics provides the tools, conceptual schemes, empirical practices
and techniques of measurement for its investigation. One of the
principal ways in which the distinctions of education can be observed
and manipulated in a systematic way is through technology. Computer
technology is everywhere in education, and through its deployment and
use, we manipulate our distinction-making processes. Every technical
intervention tweaks some distinction or other - whether it is through
making distinctions between face-to-face engagement and online
engagement, or between real experience and virtual reality, or between
different styles of video presentation, or in ways of monitoring student
progress, or the use of social software, or between playing a computer
game and learning from a book.</p>
<p>Technology enables experiments which change the way we make
distinctions. Cybernetics provides a body of consistent theory for
investigating, measuring, explaining and predicting the effects of
transforming distinctions. Cybernetics alongside technology presents an
opportunity not only to investigate technology in education, but more
profoundly to grasp the ancient practices of social cultivation and
apprehend the “clash of wills and interests” that Hughes quite rightly
identifies.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="computers-and-contemplation">
<h2>Computers and Contemplation<a class="headerlink" href="#computers-and-contemplation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Computers have changed everything. And yet education has always involved
technology. In organised education from earliest times, the instruments
and artifacts of teaching and learning have included such technologies
as the printing press, blackboards, slates, chalk, exercise books, pens,
paper, photocopiers and overhead projectors - all have been tools of
social coordination. Among the earliest technologies we know of are
tools of social coordination and religious ceremony (often musical
instruments) [&#64;pacey_meaning_1999]. The spaces within which education
takes place have also been technological: chairs, desks, and even the
classroom itself. Stretching things a bit further, we might inquire into
the technological nature of the institution itself, or as Martin
Heidegger and others have argued, the technological nature of language.
Curriculum, timetable and examinations are all ‘instruments’ of
education’s social coordination. The advent of computers in education -
and particularly the advent of the World Wide Web - seems to have
ushered in something new.</p>
<p>The word ‘com-puter’ comes from latin “<em>com-putare</em>.” ‘Putare’ means to
<em>think</em> or to <em>comtemplate</em> - so the computer is means of
contemplating-with. There is some ambiguity in its name as to whether
what is ‘contemplated’ are merely the multiple sources of data which are
fed into its inputs, or it is the relation between the computer’s
processing of its inputs with the thoughts of human beings operating it.
If the computer is part of the contemplating human-machine system, then
our questions concern how our new human-machine system is different from
the social system that preceded the computer. With what kind of science
might we investigate this, and with what kind of tools might we now
organise ourselves? In the subtitle of the first book on cybernetics,
Norbert Wiener suggested an approach: ‘Cybernetics: Or the Control and
Communication in the Animal and the Machine’
[&#64;wiener_cybernetics:_2013].</p>
<p>It has become common - particularly in the literature on educational
technology - to claim that a tool or an instrument, whether it is
software, hardware, or an institutional process like an exam, possesses
a <em>function</em>, or in more recent terminology, an <em>affordance</em>
[&#64;conole_what_2004]. For reasons which will be explained in Chapter 5, I
argue that thinking about affordance in this way is unhelpful. The
cybernetic focus avoids talk of function or affordance, but instead
concerns itself with the study of self-organising systems operating
within <em>constraints</em> [&#64;glasersfeld_radical_1995].</p>
<p>Objects - both hardware and software - are constraints on the
self-organisation processes of humans. But this constraint-focus allows
us to admit not just tangible objects like pens and classrooms, but the
linguistic constructs of education - the protocols and procedures of the
institution, the curriculum, the declarations of success and failure,
the issuing of certificates, even the weird ritualised objects of cap,
gown and university mace.</p>
<p>Focus on constraint also helps us to understanding something of what
computers have done to education. The ‘old’ technologies of education
(pens, blackboards, classrooms) exercised constraint in a way which was
framed by their material constitution. The only mutable constraints were
institutional procedures, new editions of textbooks, or new pedagogical
approaches. This created stability in the practices which formed within
institutions. Teachers and learners could be coordinated within known
and reliable constraints, with students sitting in a classroom facing a
single teacher at the lectern or blackboard. The technologies of
education reinforced the distinctions from which the institution of
education was already comprised.</p>
<p>Computers are different in facilitating the manipulation of constraints.
The way a computer screen presents changing possibilities for action as
we type a phrase into a search engine, click on the hyperlinks which are
presented to us, and then invites us to negotiate whatever new
possibilities for action have been programmed into particular webpages,
illustrates this computer-driven mutability of constraint. The human
experience of this process reminds us of the human-machine system we are
in: very real emotions arise in response to mechanical processes, not
dissimilar to the fundamental emotional impact of physical constraints
such as prison walls, one-way traffic systems, central heating or alarm
clocks.</p>
<p>A constraint prevents certain things happening. New objects and
technologies change existing constraints. They present us with a new
option for acting. The flush toilet presented a new option for managing
domestic hygiene, the ink pen presented a new option for writing, and
the motorcar presented a new option for getting around. These new
options interact with existing constraints. This interaction is dynamic,
and, as Illich and others have pointed out [&#64;illich_tools_2001] can
sometimes be pathological.</p>
<p>So what are the effects of the continually mutable constraints of the
computer on the existing constraints of formal education? What has been
the effect of an explosion of new options within education? When an
explosion of new options occurs, how do institutions react?</p>
<p>A comparable situation is that between the invention of printing in 1438
and the institution of the Catholic Church throughout the rest of the
15^th^ century prior to the reformation in 1517. The attitude towards
technology by education has been remarkably similar to the attitude of
the church towards Guttenberg and his press. It has been one of
attenuating the many new possibilities into those possibilities which
the institution can deal with. More specifically, it has been about
attenuating the new possibilities into those which serve the
institution’s existing structures.</p>
<p>At the present moment, our understanding of educational technology is
framed by the use of computers which has been shaped by institutions.
Classes have been reproduced in the Virtual Learning Environment(VLE)/
Learning Management System, face-to-face learning discussions have been
reproduced in online forums, books and journals have been reproduced in
online web-pages behind publisher paywalls. The multimedia capabilities
of the technology have been exploited to enrich learning content with
animations and various forms of interactivity. The analytic capabilities
of technology have afforded new methods of judgement-making,
instrumentalising the judgement of scholarship to the ‘H-index,’ and in
the process professionalising the business of academic management. In
many cases, the technology has been used to massify existing structures:
MOOCs, for example, are giant classrooms in a giant VLE. Despite the
power of the technology and its transformative effect on other
industries, many things remain untouched in education. Almost all
universities continue to recruit en-mass in September and assess
(usually by examination) in June. Whatever flexibility the technology
affords has not been carried forwards into the core business of
declaring the success and failure of its students.</p>
<p>The parallels to the Catholic church are striking. The church sought to
protect its interests through using printing to amplify its indulgence
business (the similarities between an indulgence and a university
certificate are striking!), whilst attempting to ensure that the core
operation of maintaining the church’s position as the single entry point
of access to personal salvation was protected. It took 80 years for
technology to challenge this in a meaningful and profoundly shocking
way.</p>
<p>The vision of people like Martin Luther and William Tyndale was to see
the church within the context of the whole system of their society and
technology. They imagined: “given we have printing, what might religion
be like?” A whole-system approach to education and technology asks
“given that we have technology, what might education now be like?” A
whole-system approach to society asks a related question: “given that we
have technology, how should society be organised?” In essence, the
systems approach deals with wholes, not with aggregations of parts.</p>
<p>The danger of existing in a technological world <em>without</em> seeing things
whole are apparent everywhere. Seen separately from their society,
Ulrich Beck and others have argued that technologies have created risk
and scarcity [&#64;beck_risk_1992]. From nuclear waste to global warming,
from automation and unemployment to the social panopticon, technological
artifacts create new anxieties about the future. Education presents
itself both as an insurance to future uncertainty, and as a cause of new
anxieties and risks in its own right. Education creates the risk of
failure. Parents worry about their children failing in school. Schools
have convinced everyone that the only route to the acquisition of status
and security is through the formal processes of certification, which can
only be gained through them. In many cases, individuals will pay large
sums of money for themselves or their children to get the ‘best’
education. And yet, when all the veneer is removed, there is usually a
classroom, a group of students, powerpoint, assessments, a timetable and
a teacher. Why one institution than another? Why a grammar school and
not a comprehensive? Why Oxford and not the Open University? Why one
subject and not another? Why bother with any of it?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="distinctions-of-education">
<h2>Distinctions of Education<a class="headerlink" href="#distinctions-of-education" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To identify a discipline is to make a distinction: such-and-such is
maths, this is physics and so on. Every distinction has two sides: there
is the view of physics from maths, and there is the view of maths from
physics. If education were a discipline, where would we draw its
distinction? Or to put it another way, what <em>isn’t</em> education?</p>
<p>Hughes’s attempt to define education as “one of the major human arts, or
complexes of arts” is a distinction which draws a boundary between a
discipline (as he sees it) and the activities of education. If we were
to draw this distinction, and ‘education’ were placed in a box, what
would Hughes see as being <em>outside</em> the box?</p>
<p>Would he see the disciplines of <em>maths</em>, <em>physics</em>, <em>geography</em>,
<em>music</em>, <em>history</em>, <em>anthropology</em> and so on all existing outside the
box, where education is considered to be a “complex of arts?” Would he
make (as many do today) a distinction between ‘formal’ and ‘informal’
learning?</p>
<p>Quite quickly we find ourselves asking not whether education or anything
else is a discipline, but “what <em>is</em> a discipline?” Disciplines exist
<em>through</em> education and its curricula, timetables, examinations and
certificates and so the circularity of the problem of whether
educational technology, education or anything else is a discipline
independent of the social practices of education becomes increasingly
confusing. Education appears as the process through which the
distinctions of disciplines are maintained.</p>
<p>It’s not just education which suffers from the problem of distinction
boundaries: health, employment, food, housing, transport, democracy and
the arts are all entail distinctions which display a similar complexity,
about which there are many possible ways of describing the relations
between them. Cybernetics is trans-disciplinary to the extent to which a
coherent working-out in one domain applies equally to many others. The
circularity of distinction-making is one of the principle things that
cybernetics studies [&#64;spencer-brown_laws_2008]. But once this
circularity is appreciated, certainties about distinctions between
disciplines disappears. To see how, we need to start drawing…</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="drawing-education">
<h2>Drawing Education<a class="headerlink" href="#drawing-education" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Drawing a distinction between one thing and another is always the first
(and essential) step in being able to study something. Distinctions are
made about biological species, artistic forms, philosophical positions,
times of day, colours, or sounds and movements. Education feeds on
distinctions.</p>
<p>A distinction is a boundary. It constrains one set of things as
belonging to one group, and another set of things as belonging to a
different group. In making a distinction about red butterflies, a line
is drawn and criteria established to identify whether a particular
object belongs on the side of the line which says ‘red butterflies’ and
everything else not a red butterfly. The red butterfly distinction is
marked by constraining what does not meet the criteria (other
distinctions) for a red butterfly. A distinction is a choice of a
constraint. The choosing, however, is itself constrained by other
things: for example, norms, values, institutions, education and
individual expectations.</p>
<p>Every distinction exists within distinctions at a different level. We
might make the distinction about butterflies, but where are the
distinctions made about the scientific or aesthetic norms, values and
expectations within which the butterfly distinction is made? To explore
distinction-making as a process, we have to become aware of both sides
of the distinction in order to see the complex structures of hierarchies
which might be at work in establishing even the simplest judgements
about reality.</p>
<p>We might draw a distinction about education much like the distinction
which Hughes tries to draw. If we want to say education is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y\)</span> or
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z\)</span>, then a distinction is drawn with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z\)</span> in a box, and
everything that isn’t <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> outside the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> box Then we can say that
everything outside <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> constrains the definition of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>. For example,
Hughes distinction between Education as a complex of arts and what he
calls ‘disciplines’ can be drawn as in Figure
<a class="reference external" href="#fig:educationconstraint">1.1</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:educationconstraint”}.</p>
<p><img alt="Hughes's defininition of education within uncertainconstraints" src="_images/noteducation.jpg" />{#fig:educationconstraint
width=”\textwidth”}</p>
<p>Drawing things like this immediately raises questions. The arrows
between the disciplines in the diagram show a relationship which is not
clear in Hughes’s description. <em>Maths</em> and <em>physics</em> have a relation to
<em>education</em>. Education shapes what they are: so shouldn’t they be
<em>within</em> the education box? But also maths and physics have a
relationship to each other: mathematical techniques like calculus
derived from new theories in physics and astronomical observations. So
this diagram isn’t very satisfactory - but the lack of clarity in
Hughes’s description becomes apparent through trying to draw it as a
diagram.</p>
<p>Drawing distinctions like this is a powerful way of working-out the
logic of our understanding. Cybernetic diagrams involve boxes and lines
connecting those boxes. The drawing of boxes to separate things raises
an important question: what does the line that bounds the box mean?</p>
<p>If we consider something to be drawn outside the box, we must also
consider a box to be drawn around that thing too. In Figure
<a class="reference external" href="#fig:educationconstraint">1.1</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:educationconstraint”} the drawing effectively asks “What
is outside education and outside the thing which is outside education?”
The complexity of this quickly becomes apparent. There doesn’t appear to
be any single way of drawing the various constraints of education. The
problem of education becomes the very problem of defining it.</p>
<p>Pursuing this further, the problem of drawing distinctions is one of
identifying the constraints within which the distinction is drawn.
Different cultures, different periods in history, different social
contexts (for example, industrial training, or academic philosophy) all
constrain different views on education. Moreover, most of the
distinctions we live with are mutable, and the constraints within which
those distinctions are made shift.</p>
<p>And there is another problem. Is a diagram ever static? Is there a
configuration of constraints which is universal? Is one person’s view on
education the same as another’s? Social change results from shifting
constraints whether in agriculture, human rights, employment practices,
sanitation, housing or education. The study of social change - and with
it, the organisation of education - is the study of continually shifting
constraints.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="recursive-distinctions">
<h2>Recursive Distinctions<a class="headerlink" href="#recursive-distinctions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Constraints are recursive and potentially self-referential: in other
words, something can be its own constraint. But whatever is placed in a
box is constrained by many things. Yet the relations of constraint from
one layer to another will vary from one observer to another. For
example, education can be drawn, like many social structures, as a kind
of hierarchy. At a simple level, we might see an order in institutions
which connect the individual learner to their class, from the class to
the department, from the department to the University, and so on. Figure
<a class="reference external" href="#fig:perspective">1.2</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:perspective”} illustrates that it really depends on where
an observer sits as to how they see the system.</p>

<p>Each element in each nested box is subject to multiple constraints which
would make the diagram much messier. For example, the university
department has the form it does partly because of the expectations of
the learners and teachers. Equally, the university only exists because
there are learners and academics who want to study there. Any particular
layering of the hierarchy of constraints in the above diagram could be
re-represented and defended with any other layering of constraints.</p>
<p>If we were to more abstractly express the way constraints interact,
rather than drawing boxes we would be better drawing nodes and arrows
connecting them. Thus in Figure
<a class="reference external" href="#fig:networkconstraint">1.3</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:networkconstraint”}, any path may be taken between the
nodes to construct any array of different constraint relations. For
example, in the bottom right-hand diagram, the constraint from the
learner to the class is arrow (a), and the constraint from class to
department is arrow (b), and so on. Drawn like this the arrows can be
followed in a myriad of ways, and there is no reason why a particular
category cannot constrain itself (for example, the concept of ‘class’
might constrain the concept of ‘class’): uncertainty is inherent in the
network of constraints.</p>
<p><img alt="A generative network of possible embedded distinctions orconstraints" src="_images/networkdistinction.jpg" />{#fig:networkconstraint
width=”\textwidth”}</p>
<p>Every constraint produces a distinction. What is a <em>learner</em> if it is
not the <em>product</em> of the distinction of the educational institution and
social norms? Many of the distinctions are themselves constrained by,
among other factors, the practices of education.</p>
<p>The way people make sense of the world is conditioned by their
experiences growing up. It depends on families, parents, friends,
culture, work and so on. With different social environments, we find
different distinctions. We find different attitudes to education and
different orientations towards its politics. We find different degrees
of concern for our children and their educational progress. We find
different attitudes to teaching and formal education. Each of these
things comes from a complex web of constraints which belong partly to
the structural constraints of a society, and partly to the historical
and biographical processes which formed them. Our question concerns the
dynamics of these constraints and the mechanisms wherein they arise.</p>

<h2>Transductions and Distinctions<a class="headerlink" href="#transductions-and-distinctions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If there are many possible distinctions about ‘maths,’ ‘education,’
‘hospitals’ or ‘chairs’ how it is that we maintain relatively stable
distinctions in society? There must be a process which is responsible
for maintaining a coherent and agreed set of distinctions around which
we coordinate our social lives, our education system, our scientific
practice, and so on. At a human level, this process is conversation, and
much of this book is about how conversation is essential to the managing
of uncertainty about distinctions. But conversation illustrates
something that can be understood more abstractly as a process of
creating a boundary that converts one thing into another. So the
learner’s boundary with the educational institution is formed by the
definition of courses and assessments. The institution’s requirements
are converted across the boundary into instructions to the learner to do
certain things. The conversion of one set of distinctions to another is
called ‘transduction.’ Gilbert Simondon, whose work unites cybernetics
and what he calls ‘the technical object,’ argues that a ‘transducer’ is
an operator at</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“the margin of indeterminacy between […] two domains, that which
brings potential energy to its actualization” [&#64;simondon_mode_2017
155]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In engineering, transduction is the process of taking one form of energy
and turning it into another - like an electric transformer or a
microphone. In those examples, and in every other example of
transduction, the bi-product of the conversion is the stabilised
definition of the conversion boundary. The microphone distinguishes
between sound as vibrations in the air and sound as pulses down a wire.
The transformer distinguishes differences of degree of voltage and
current. This is shown diagrammatically in Figure
<a class="reference external" href="#fig:transduction">1.4</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:transduction”}.</p>
<p><img alt="The basic elements of atransduction" src="_images/transduction.jpg" />{#fig:transduction width=”\textwidth”}</p>
<p>For Simondon, who sees human beings, and living things more generally as
transducers, the transduction process works on both sides of its
distinction. Indeterminate vibrations in air become concretised by the
microphone, just as the indeterminacy of an experience becomes
concretised by a concept or distinction. By recognising that
distinctions are maintained by a process is to recognise that the
process may change - and a change to the distinction-making process at
one level can lead to changes in the distinction-making process at many
other levels too. To change a social system - or indeed any system - we
have to adjust the transducers.</p>
<p>It’s not only the dynamics of the relation between existing
distinctions, but also the complexity introduced over time. Education is
a social process which begins at the beginning of life. Its effect on
the shape of society in the future is poorly understood, yet these
effects must result from the transformation of the distinctions made by
a child into the distinctions made by an adult. New and old distinctions
are reproduced and transformed in social structures, including
education. At the simplest level of transduction, it is obvious that
every distinction has, at some point, to be <em>learnt</em>. Distinctions about
physical entities like doors, shoes and fire form a fundamental part of
family conversations as children grow-up. The historical process of
learning a distinction emerges within constraints: there are events,
parents, experiences, bodily predispositions, family history, and so on.
The concept of education is subjected to continually transforming
constraints.</p>
<p>The idea that the social world is reproduced and transformed by social
activity - whether it is through discourse, the creating of new
technologies, or manifesting political structures - or that individuals
themselves are shaped by the social world in which they find themselves
has been a common theme since the inception of sociology. At a crude
level, the differences in dynamics have been used to make broad
distinctions between the major sociological theories. So for example,
Durkheim is seen to argue that sociology concerns itself with
institutional constraints bearing on individuals, whereas Weber builds
his social model from individuals whose action results in the formation
of institutions. In the later 20^th^ century a deeper critical
appreciation has led to a view among many leading sociologists that
there is both reproduction and transformation of society by agents, and
there is a conditioning and constraint by society of individuals. The
basic idea is articulated by Giddens in his ‘stucturation theory’
[&#64;giddens_constitution_1986], Archer, in her theory of ‘morphogenesis’
[&#64;archer_structure_2008] and Bhaskar in his ‘Transformational Model of
Social Activity’ [&#64;bhaskar_realist_2008]. Each argues with the finer
details of the others’ ideas (Archer and Bhaskar object to Giddens
because Giddens sees society as a social construct, not a real existing
entity) in a discursive process within sociology which, at the very
least, demonstrates the fundamental principle they are trying to
express. The underlying reasons for disagreement between people who, at
a broader level agree, is a symptom of the ways in which distinctions in
education are made in the first place. They are transductions precisely
in Simondon’s sense that their points of argument mediate at the ‘margin
of indeterminacy.’</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="education-and-time">
<h2>Education and Time<a class="headerlink" href="#education-and-time" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>These processes occur over time. The problem with diagrams like those
above is that the dimension of time in the <em>process</em> of maintaining a
distinction is missing.</p>
<p>The world continually moves forward, clocks continue to tick, the second
law of thermodynamics gradually sees the increase in disorder in the
universe and life creates new order. Metabolism produces order through
consuming nutrients, and thought produces increased order in our brains.
Schroedinger argued that this was a fundamental principle of life
processes: they work against increasing disorder (or <em>entropy</em>) in the
universe. Life is about *neg-*entropy:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The essential thing in metabolism is that the organism succeeds in
freeing itself from all the entropy it cannot help producing while
alive. [&#64;schrodinger_what_2012 71]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The unfolding experience of time-based arts provides a good example of
the dynamic tension between entropy and negentropy, and has many
similarities to the experience of learning. Cinema, music and theatre
are forms of expression which display two interacting dimensions which
are also common to all learning processes. There is a dimension of
structure of things which occur at any moment, and there is a dimension
of things which unfold over time.</p>
<p>In his work on linguistics, Fernand de Saussure first theorized these as
‘synchonic’ for the former, and ‘diachronic’ for the latter. Saussure’s
distinction has been influential on sociologists: society too has
synchronic and diachronic dimensions, with complex interactions between
the synchronic structures of institutions and diachronic processes of
human agency which either reproduce and transform those structures.</p>
<p>Important though sociological interpretations are, there is a core
problem in such approaches: in concerning themselves with creating
categories to describe the structure and dynamics of social life, sight
is lost of the process by which their categories are created. Social
theory becomes context-blind. Among the processes which contribute to
their categories are the processes which uphold the structures, norms
and practices of education and its institutions, academic societies,
journals and so on. Cybernetics, by contrast, examines the process by
which <em>all</em> categories are created: what is happening both in the
synchronic and diachronic dimensions is continual transduction.</p>
<p>Figure <a class="reference external" href="#ref:diachronic">[ref:diachronic]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”ref:diachronic”} shows this dynamic as three dimensions of
synchronic, diachronic and reflexive process of thought, working
simultaneously together. Although the diachronic process works over
time, and thus with the increase of entropy, what emerges is not an
increase in disorder. Diachronic processes work in concert with
reflexive processes which counteract increasing entropy to produce
order. Over time we see the emergence of new descriptions about what has
happened and of what might be about to happen. Continually feeding both
are distinctions about current structural relations. For example, the
lights, sounds and figures at the beginning of a movie create perceptual
transductions which gradually transform with the diachronic perception
of form, structure and story to create the transductions of expectation
of what might happen next. In a world of online and face-to-face
engagement, the perceptual patterns of interaction between diachronic,
synchronic and reflexive processes is continually shifting against a
background of similar processes occurring at different levels of social
organisation, from the family to the social media corporation, to the
university library, or the press.</p>
<p>Our categories of understanding are unstable. Time can be thought of as
a dimension which drives the continual generation of new transductions,
reinforcing or transforming categories. These new transductions
interfere with existing transductions producing shifting patterns of
perception and intellectual growth. There is a continual recursive
process whose properties at any particular instant are unstable, and
about which any description (and the transduction which maintains it) is
itself a component of that instability. But it is this instability
through which a dynamic of growth can be understood to unfold over time.
Understanding the emergent dynamics in education like this is at first
unsettling: the difficulty of the questions increases: where did <em>my</em>
concept of education come from? Does it come from my current context?
Does it come from a political orientation? Where did that come from? Did
it come from childhood experiences? Or from my parents? Or siblings? Or
did it come from events which occurred during my schooling? Did it
matter that I grew up in poverty, or that I attended a state school?</p>
<p>Here we have the essence of the problem of failing to acknowledge the
uncertainty in education and a theme which recurs throughout this book.
The foundations of learning, just as the foundations of education, are
inherently and <em>necessarily</em> unstable, but it is because of its
instability that learning is possible. Our institutional and political
structures of education, however, bury the confusion which is inherent
in the distinction-making process. Our schools, education ministries,
professional bodies and government hide the complexity of education and
the difficulties in making distinctions about it. In the process, they
exacerbate the uncertainty in the environment.</p>
<p>Technology is at the root of this. The ancient institutions of education
and science were once able to deal with (and harness) the instabilities
of learning processes over the centuries because those uncertainties
were manageable through the hierarchically-organised practices of
education. This, however, would collapse if the uncertainty of the
environment in which it operated became magnified to the point that the
old-fashioned methods not only no longer worked, but exacerbated the
uncertainty. Technology has given rise to the proliferation of
uncertainty in the environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="practicalities-and-uncertainty">
<h2>Practicalities and Uncertainty<a class="headerlink" href="#practicalities-and-uncertainty" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In universities today technology has assumed a position whereby it
manages all their main processes: students and teachers cannot avoid the
Virtual Learning Environment or e-portfolio system; they must submit
their marks online; they have their lectures videoed; they refer to
journals online, and have to negotiate hurdles of access to articles
which their institutions may or may not subscribe to. This keeps
everybody very busy.</p>
<p>Behind each of these technological processes there are more fundamental
processes which uphold sets of distinctions about education. Educational
management’s role is to maintain distinctions about the award of
degrees, the conduct of research, the organisation of teaching, the
coordination of the curriculum, the control of quality, the upholding of
the reputation of the institution, the recruitment of teachers and the
care of learners. Technology has been enlisted in support of all this.
Yet, the context within which educational management occurs is the rest
of society - and, in the last 20 years or so - this has been a
<em>technological</em> society. The same technology the university uses to
support its practices has caused an explosion in the number options that
human beings have to talk to each other, to share ideas and knowledge,
and to come together and organise themselves. Technology has enabled
individuals to do many of the things that they could <em>only</em> do within
the institution a few years earlier.</p>
<p>In the cat-and-mouse game of technology in institutions, it’s impossible
to avoid technological paraphernalia, or indeed to resist
ever-increasing demands for further ‘innovation’ in teaching and
learning. Yet each new computer system, whether VLE, e-portfolio or
anti-plagiarism tool, results in increasing the complexity within the
institution. This means that the institution’s capacity to help manage
society’s exploding uncertainty is reduced, whilst the institution’s
technological response merely increases the complexity of the
environment. Institutions find themselves in a positive feedback loop
with technology.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="coordinating-expectations">
<h2>Coordinating Expectations<a class="headerlink" href="#coordinating-expectations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>An illustration of the problem can be gained from examining any common
educational technology. One example lies in the way learning outcomes
and competency criteria become encoded in technology in the assessment
of student work [&#64;biggs_teaching_2011]. To compensate for subjectivity,
institutions use elaborate schemes of double-marking, examination boards
and quality monitoring and improvement regimes which constrain the
ultimate judgements that are delivered to the student. Such structures
are generated through the need to normatively establish codes of
expectation of behaviour not only among learners, but also among
teachers, the administration of the institution and ultimately the
expectations of employers. The constraints which bear upon these
processes continually shift. The ‘marketisation’ process in education
introduces new constraints which create greater flexibility in the
requirements for keeping students on courses (and keeping them passing)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>but this is sometimes at a cost of inaccurately certifying students as
competent.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In each of these processes of coordination, there is (or ought to be) a
conversation. In the conversation between a teacher and their learners,
the constraints within which students must operate to meet the
assessment criteria can be explained. Teachers can try to help learners
fit the constraints of the institution’s assessment processes.
Sometimes, however, learners are left needing to ‘second-guess’ the
expectations of a teacher or examiner, without a clear idea of how they
should meet a particular learning outcome or assessment criterion. In
conversation with other teachers - whether it is with the members of a
course validation panel, or with second-markers, or with the assessment
board - the coordination of expectations is established through the
interactions with different stakeholders in the institutional process,
each of whom is subject to different sets of constraints. For example, a
course tutor may defend the work of a student aware of constraints
pertaining to a particular case, whilst others will be operating within
the constraints of attempting to maintain equity in the judgements
passed by the institution, or wishing to respond to the market-driven
demand to not fail students. In these conversations, learning outcomes
are codified statements produced by the system, but whose descriptions
and interpretation will vary from one person to another. A single
learning outcome presents multiple possibilities of interpretation.</p>
<p>For example, in medical education, expectations of assessment are often
coordinated through technology between learners, teachers and
clinicians. In addition to learning outcomes, medical students have a
set of <em>competency criteria</em> which identify specific aspects of skill
and practice which are required (by professional bodies) to be observed
and approved within the context of a work-based setting. Competency
statements may be broken-down into many specific areas. For example, in
order to perform a clinical skill, a list of requirements similar to
Figure <a class="reference external" href="#ref:competency">1.5</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”ref:competency”} must be observed and ‘ticked.’ Among medical
practitioners and academics, there is much argument as to what should be
listed as competency criteria and how this process should unfold:
different individuals will have different criteria, or different
criticisms will be made of the process based on different
understandings. What gets presented to the student is a compromise
between the views of many people.</p>
<p><img alt="An example of competency criteria for a medical procedure as presentedin an online form" src="_images/competency1.jpg" />{#ref:competency width=”\textwidth”}</p>
<p>In this example, the expectation is that a clinician observes a student
performing a clinical procedure and ticks each box according to whether
they think each moment of a clinical procedure listed is performed
‘adequately,’ ‘inadequately’ or ‘not attempted.’ Figure
<a class="reference external" href="#ref:competency">1.5</a>{reference-type=”ref” reference=”ref:competency”}
shows a small section of the questions to be addressed.</p>
<p>In any professional domain, there are multiple descriptions of competent
practice and there are also multiple <em>levels</em> of understanding of the
process of completing the electronic form. Will all clinicians observe
each moment carefully and thoughtfully assign their tick? Is this
expected by the authors of the form? Or will clinicians simply tick
everything if they are generally happy?</p>
<p>This particular example seems overly complex, but it raises important
questions. Why is technology seen to be appropriate? Why is it that
multiple (and often conflicting) expectations result in increased
technological complexity? Why don’t people simply refuse to use
technology? What happens to the conversations between learners,
clinicians and teachers in such a technological environment? The
questions expose the inherent uncertainty in the educational situation,
the clinical situation and the broader system. If the technology serves
any useful function, it is to expose these uncertainties and provide a
focus for discussing them.</p>
<p>The collection of data from students on medical placement is regarded as
an essential mark of evidence of clinical competency. The fact that in
reality what is evidenced is that a box was ticked is indicative of the
need to manage the uncertainties which surround the very concept of
clinical competency in the first place. The technology and its
procedures is a transducer between the uncertainty surrounding the
concept of competency and the institutional processes which certify
medical students as ‘competent.’ By instrumentalising the process, it
attempts to remove the uncertainty surrounding competence. The ultimate
result, however, is increased complexity and increased uncertainty.</p>
<p>As a powerful transducer, technology operates on many levels: it
produces the phenomena of perception in its form and interfaces. It
presents relations of concepts in the messages it sends students and
staff. And it frames practices in ways which conform to the
institution’s requirements. This multi-level transduction creates an
illusion of process and simplicity within the institution in a world
which becomes increasingly complex.</p>
<p>Institutions have needed increasingly powerful transducers between their
processes and the technological society in which they operate. From the
bureaucracy of ‘educational quality’ to the vaguaries of whether a
student has met a particular learning outcome or not, institutional
procedures have increased in complexity alongside their attenuation of
increasing uncertainty. Furthermore, the teachers operating within
institutions have got more busy attempting to manage the technology, and
increasingly find themselves less able to think or even to talk to one
another about their own uncertainty.</p>
<p>Because technology performs such an important role in maintaining the
institution’s distinctions, fundamental questioning of technology’s
effectiveness or the institution’s procedures are suppressed in the
imperative to manage the ever increasing complexity of the system.
Ironically, the institution’s use of <em>communications</em> technology to
uphold its traditional practices and distinctions threatens the
viability of the conversations which drive the core mission of
scientific discovery and the preservation of knowledge. The situation
isn’t sustainable: the only conclusion to reach is that technology’s
role in education <em>cannot</em> be to uphold the traditional institution.</p>

<h2>The Conversational Transformation<a class="headerlink" href="#the-conversational-transformation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This is not an easy beginning to this book. If you started reading this
chapter with a fairly clear idea of what education is and what it’s
about, you’re either convinced I am over-complicating things, or simply
wrong, or you are considerably more confused that you were. In response,
I would argue that I have attempted to adjust your transducers, and that
both responses are entirely explicable as a result. Transduction is a
complicated term, and for many of the following chapters I will prefer
to talk about ‘conversation,’ because this is the transduction process
we do on a daily basis. If you are confused, then the thing to do is to
talk about it. Of course, if you think I’m wrong, you might want to bury
it! (But that is also transduction…)</p>
<p>The driver for a fundamental technological reorganisation of education
is a return to what actually happens between teachers and learners:
<em>conversation</em>. It is an irony of computer technology that it has
introduced new options for communication which have vastly expanded the
opportunities for people to have conversations online, yet at the same
time, its effects appear to have led to a technocratic rigidity within
education as it seeks to exploit the technology to reinforce its
existing structures.</p>
<p>The hallmark of technocracy is the loss of the variety of description in
the system. The problem is well-known in cybernetics. Heinz von
Foerster, one of the founding fathers of cybernetics, commented in the
early 1970s about the impact of technology on libraries:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“we have, hopefully only temporarily, relinquished our responsibility
to ask for a technology that will solve existent problems. Instead we
have allowed existent technology to create problems it can solve.”
[&#64;foerster_observing_1981]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The aim of the following chapters is to articulate the existent problems
of our technological society, the human capacity to deal with them most
effectively, and the role that education and conversation play in
meeting that challenge.</p>

<div class="section" id="conversation-as-coordination">
<h2>Conversation as Coordination<a class="headerlink" href="#conversation-as-coordination" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Everything is subject to multiple descriptions and of multiple ways of
talking. Conversation is the process of coordinating the differences
between descriptions. It is through conversation that scientists in
every field coordinate their understanding. Processes of conversation
also make possible the coherent social structures of education, which
exist despite and <em>because of</em> the variety of descriptions which are
made of it by its multiple stakeholders. Conversations occur between
teachers and learners, between learners and their peers, between parents
and children, between scientists, and between colleagues in an
educational institution. Conversation is a variety of transduction
process - it results in the maintenance or change of distinctions. The
precise details of this kind of transduction are not as simple as the
operation of a heat exchanger, but to explore how conversation works is
to understand why cybernetics is concerned with processes of
conversation above any supposed objectivity or universality of any
particular description.</p>
<p>A conversation is a kind of dance. The word <em>conversation</em> comes from
the Latin, <em>con-versare</em>. It means, “to turn together.” Two people can
dance and intuitively understand the moves of the other. Equally,
dancing can be awkward, or sometimes break down. Conversations are much
like this. The distinctions between the things that happen in the
‘successful’ dance and what happens in the ‘awkward’ dance are subtle.
Many signals about the wishes of each person are communicated through
movements of the legs, hands, eyes, the coordination with the music, and
the sense of physical contact. Each of these presents sets of
distinctions, and many different distinctions co-exist at any time. If
the dance partner is unable to read these, or react appropriately, then
of course things will break down. But if things do break down, then the
more expert dancer is likely to simplify the moves, to reduce the number
of distinctions they make so that their partner might have a chance to
response to something less complex.</p>
<p>Both the complexity of multiple distinctions in dancing, and the
shifting down from a complex dance to a simple one are aspects of
conversation. What happens in the ‘shifting down’ is a <em>recalibration</em>
of the moves that the dancer makes. Learning conversations are precisely
like this. Few learning conversations begin with expert coordination
between teacher and learner. There are always processes of recalibration
as the teacher recognises the need to simply their own complexity so as
to maintain an effective dialogue with the learner. Conversation is much
like the unfolding pattern of a piece of music or an improvisation.</p>
<p>The multiplicity of description can be compared to the multiple
frequencies which make up an individual sound in a piece of music. A
spectral analysis uses complex mathematics to uncover the frequencies
which are combined to make a sound, producing graphs like the one shown
in Figure <a class="reference external" href="#ref:music1">2.1</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”ref:music1”}.</p>
<p><img alt="A spectral analysis illustrating synchronic and diachronic aspects ofsound" src="_images/musicdiachronic.jpg" />{#ref:music1 width=”\textwidth”}</p>
<p>The multiple frequencies of a sound might be thought of rather like the
multiple descriptions of a concept. They are presented in a structural
relation to one another at an instant (synchronically). But of course,
the sound unfolds over time (diachronically). For example, in the graph
above, a pattern from left to right is detectable in the ‘humps’ of the
darkest line (the fundamental frequency), while there is a vertical
pattern at every instant in the arrangement of parallel lines above the
fundamental tone. Conversations may be thought of as working in a
similar way: they comprise diachronic and synchronic aspects, each
contributing multiple descriptions of what is trying to be said which
are coordinated throughout the process. As one talks, individual words,
phonemes and gestures combine with an emergent sense of structure and
expectation in whoever is listening. So what if the medium for
conversation changes? What if instead of words and phonemes, it’s text,
characters and a timeline? Does it make a difference?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="technology-and-conversation">
<h2>Technology and Conversation<a class="headerlink" href="#technology-and-conversation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The capacity of the World-Wide Web to facilitate conversations online
was one of the most exciting ideas for educational technologists because
it promised to free education from its traditional constraints of time
and co-location. With what seemed to be escape from the bounds of the
classroom and timetable, new possibilities for organising education
presented themselves. If conversations could be coordinated
technologically, could the institutionally-framed constraints of
curriculum similarly be transcended? Might there be new ways of dealing
with assessment and certification or the social status that is accorded
by the education system?</p>
<p>In the years that have passed since the advent of online forums, wikis,
VLEs and social media, many of these questions are still being asked. It
was hoped that the new ‘personal’ technologies would transform
educational organisation to the point that education would no longer
insist on students adapting themselves to fit a standard curriculum, but
rather educational provision could adapt to individual students
[&#64;johnson_personal_2016; &#64;wilson_personal_2009]. It was suggested that
as the power of personal technologies outstripped what could be provided
centrally by institutions, and the costs of tuition rose, there would be
increasing demands for technologically-driven flexibility, with students
exploiting learning resources freely available on the web, and
challenging the traditional structures of the university. Yet, as many
writers on educational technology acknowledge, the transformation hasn’t
been quite what many hoped for. Diana Laurillard, for example, comments
that:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“The promise of learning technologies is that they appear to provide
what the theorists are calling for. Because they are interactive,
communicative, user-controlled technologies, they fit well with the
requirement for social-constructivist, active learning. They have had
little critique from educational design theorists. On the other hand,
the empirical work on what is actually happening in education now that
technology is widespread has shown that the reality falls far short of
the promise.” [&#64;laurillard_teaching_2012 83]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>As things have turned out, curriculum, classroom, timetable, lectures,
exams and essays have proved remarkably resilient. What happened?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dancing-on-stilts">
<h2>Dancing on Stilts<a class="headerlink" href="#dancing-on-stilts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Was there something wrong with the idea that conversation online could
be functionally-equivalent to conversation face-to-face? The dance
metaphor of conversation goes some way to explaining the difficulties of
online communication. A dance does not involve ‘exchange’ of messages in
the way that is often conceived in the literature about conversation in
education. The classic example is Laurillard’s conversation model
[&#64;laurillard_rethinking_2001]. In Laurillard’s model of teaching and
learning processes, which she adapted from the more sophisticated (but
extremely dense) cybernetic <em>conversation theory</em> of Gordon Pask
[&#64;pask_cybernetics_1975], there is an emphasis on the exchange of
messages between the teacher to the student of what is to be taught, and
what action to take, and the messages from the student to the teacher as
to what is understood. Typically, the conversation model is presented as
a diagram of utterances between a teacher and a learner as shown in
Figure <a class="reference external" href="#ref:pask">2.2</a>{reference-type=”ref” reference=”ref:pask”}.</p>
<p><img alt="Pask's conversation model as an exchange ofmessages" src="_images/pask.jpg" />{#ref:pask width=”\textwidth”}</p>
<p>The conversation model imagines a teacher and a learner in some kind of
shared online environment which can both convey utterances from one to
the other, and provide tools for modelling or demonstrating what is
being talked about. Utterances about <em>why?</em> things happen occur in the
exchange at the top of the diagram, while coordinations of action within
the environment articulate <em>how?</em> things happen [&#64;scott_gordon_2001].
Fundamentally, the process is driven by a comparison between the
teacher’s messages and the student’s. For example, the teacher teaches a
concept at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a_1\)</span>, and the learner teaches back their understanding of
the concept at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b_1\)</span>. The teacher’s next utterance, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c_1\)</span> is based on
the consideration of the difference between the learner’s understanding
and the teacher’s understanding, and on it goes (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d_1\)</span>). In a mechanism
which Pask and Laurillard call ‘teach-back,’ <em>understanding</em> is said to
be achieved when the student articulates an explanation which conforms
to what they have been taught. Using the shared environment each can
demonstrate and explore actions which further stimulate conversation,
where for example, the teacher might make an intervention in the
environment at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a_2\)</span> and the learner may respond with an intervention at
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b_2\)</span>.</p>
<p>This was an attractive proposition to those who sought to defend online
utterances as being functionally-equivalent to face-to-face discussion.
Boyd, for example, describes an online learning session using a ‘shared
modelling environment’ as a means by which the understanding between
teacher and learner could be coordinated [&#64;boyd_reflections_2001]. And
yet, there seems to be something missing in descriptions of online
engagement like this: some oversight of the human condition in favour of
a rationalised explanation of learning.</p>
<p>In the enthusiasm to embrace technology and claim that education could
be transformed, sight was lost of the deeper understanding of the dance
of conversation. Where, for example, do feelings of reticence or apathy
get expressed? How can personal difficulties with the medium be
negotiated? Where does the teacher perceive that the conversation they
are having is not the conversation which is important at a particular
moment? At best, the teacher will see a lack of engagement, but will
have limited scope for addressing it. It is like trying to dance on
stilts.</p>
<p>Part of the problem lies in a misunderstanding of what Pask meant by
‘teach-back,’ and the greater sophistication which lay behind the model
presented by Laurillard. This was not a simple comparison of utterances.
Pask introduces his original idea of teach-back in the following way:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Teachback goes as follows: the teacher says of the student (or
‘subject’) that the student understands a topic to the extent that he
can teach it back to the teacher. This is, understanding is inferred
if the student can furnish an explanation of the previously discussed
topic and can also explain why he gave that explanation of how he
constructed it. The crucial point is that the student’s explanation
and the teacher’s explanation need not be, and usually are not,
identical. The student invents an explanation of his own and justifies
it by an explanation of how he arrived at it (in fact an identical
explanation is generally rejected unless the student can give a reason
why the teacher’s explanation was particularly good).
[&#64;pask_cybernetics_1975]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The difference between the teacher’s utterances and the student’s is
critical in the teachback process. Pask goes on to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>the resilience of a memory will depend upon the number of explanations
produced in teachback; for example, that a student impelled to give
many explanations will fare better at session 2 than a student
required to give only one. He has many ways of reconstructing a
concept and this redundancy will combat the effect of interfering and
incompatible learning experiences during the intervening week.
[&#64;pask_cybernetics_1975]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In other words, there is an <em>overlap</em> in the things which are described
by the different explanations that a student might produce. There is a
similar overlap in the explanations which a teacher might produce, and
there is an overlap between the explanations produced by the teacher and
the explanations produced by the learner: this overlap is what Pask
refers to as <em>redundancy</em>: multiple descriptions of the same thing. In
more recent work on cybernetics and the production of meaning, this
overlap or redundancy has been studied as a systemic feature for the
establishment of <em>meaning</em> [&#64;leydesdorff_mutual_2014].</p>
<p>If this is correct, then the role of the medium or technology in
constraining the variety of expression by learners or teachers is highly
significant. Yet in most thinking about the role of technology in
education, the capacity of the medium is often considered to be
‘neutral’ to the communication which results. But if the technological
context within which the exchange between the teacher and the learner
occurs is constrained to limited forms of articulation (such as the
ticking of boxes on the kind of forms that we saw in Chapter 1), then
the scope for the creative expression of what Pask calls the
‘redundancy’ of explanations is limited: there is only one way of
ticking a box.</p>
<p>Having said this, the flexibility to make multiple descriptions in a
medium also depends on the creativity of individuals in finding
different ways of expressing themselves through that medium. Text, for
example, appears to be a limited medium - but text is also the medium of
poets, novelists and playwrights in expressing some of the deepest
aspects of the human condition: variety of description within a
restricted medium is possible. Yet such instances of artistic expression
usually operate by finding unusual - or even perverse - usages of the
medium. For example, a novel written in a series of Twitter posts, or
messages exchanged between neighbours through the naming of wifi
networks.</p>
<p>In face-to-face communication, or indeed, in communication over video,
there are multiple descriptions of understanding expressed
simultaneously. For example, somebody might explain their understanding
with gestures and the movement of props in front of them (for example,
in explaining Newton’s Laws of Motion). Simultaneously to moving their
arms, they will give a commentary of what they mean, whilst also
modulating the tone of their voice to convey the important points. The
redundancy in such simultaneous communication can be seen if we were to
see whether the meaning of what is conveyed could still be conveyed if
any one of these different forms of communication (gestures, words,
pitch of voice) was removed. In most cases, it can - although the
resulting communication may be less compelling. This raises the question
as to what happens in communication between these different simultaneous
forms of explanation.</p>
<p>In this process of conveying simultaneous forms of communication in
conversation, the redundancy between the different messages and
different explanations suggests that there is a coordination of, or
interaction between, different constraints. Teachers and learners
operate within their own constraints, and to some extent it is the
teacher’s job to understand the constraints of the learner in order to
be able to help the learner overcome some of them. If the learner is
able to understand the constraints of the teacher, then they might
understand more clearly the conditions from which the teacher’s
utterances arise. In conversation, both teacher and learner uncover the
constraints of the other by reading into the redundancies of description
that each presents to the other. By understanding these constraints,
future utterances, recalibrations and suggestions for activity are
steered. Even in the creative use of simple medium like Twitter reveals
much about the person subverting it: a collection of short messages
conveys multiple descriptions both in its content and in the creative
act of subverting the technology. In all cases, the dance becomes
possible because the constraints are revealed through articulating the
same thing in many different ways. In other words, it is about
<em>redundancy</em>.</p>
<p>Now we can respond to the question, “How does the medium of
communication matter?” Four points can be raised:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>different media present the opportunity for the expression of
different and often multiple levels of redundancy of description;</p></li>
<li><p>different media present different opportunities for the coordination
of conversation through its capacity to reveal redundancies;</p></li>
<li><p>the combination of different media further enhances the production
of redundancy;</p></li>
<li><p>social media are mechanisms for generating redundancy of description
by other people.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Those media which convey the richest degree of redundancy of
communication present the easiest starting point for analysis. They also
present the most compelling case for the power of technology in
education. Every online course today uses videos and animations, and
many exploit visualisations, simulations, and games. Equally, in the
synchronous online conversations between individuals using Skype the
simultaneous descriptions of the voice, with its pitch, accent and
tempo, combined with images over a shared period of time presents an
experience which approaches the fidelity of face-to-face discussion -
with the benefit that these interactions can be recorded and replayed,
which is a further level of redundancy.</p>

<div class="section" id="video-and-teaching">
<h4>Video and Teaching<a class="headerlink" href="#video-and-teaching" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Video presents many overlaid descriptions of a thing. There is text,
moving images, pictures, words and speech. How meaning is conveyed
through the interaction of these different elements has been the subject
of study in cinema ever since its invention. But in terms of analysing
the way we communicate, this overlayering of multiple descriptions is
not confined to video. Indeed, it seems to be the common denominator in
all forms of aesthetic communication, from poetry to music. The
educational video is particularly interesting because the act of
teaching is also an act of creating multiple descriptions of things.
Rarely will teachers introduce a concept with a single description.
Almost always they will illustrate it with an example, or a metaphor
(“think about it like this”), or an anecdote, or they will use a
resource that says the same thing (“watch this video”). Often teachers
will not just rely on the redundancy that they are able to generate, but
also invite the further generation of redundancy from the class (“what
do you think?”).</p>
<p>It is in the study of the arts where this multiplicity of description
attracts more serious analytical attention. In his book “Cinema and the
imaginary man” [&#64;morin_cinema_2005], Edgar Morin asks the question as to
what it was that made the cinema more “affectively exciting” than its
precursor, the ‘animated photograph’ (a reference to devices like the
19^th^ century Zoetrope). In making a comparison between the
descriptions presented by the early medium and the later medium of the
cinema, Morin’s categories, shown in Figure
<a class="reference external" href="#ref:morin">[ref:morin]</a>{reference-type=”ref” reference=”ref:morin”}
highlight the increase in range of simultaneous description.</p>
<p>Morin’s categories depend on each other. They are in
mutually-constraining, and often complementary relationships to one
another. For example, the distinctions between light and shadow, slowing
down and speeding up, or the mobility of the camera and the succession
of shots.</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\parbox{10em}{Affective excitation established by the animated photograph}\begin{cases}

<p>Examining the multiplicity of the moving image in this way, we might
then consider multiplicity in other media. For example, even a static
Powerpoint page with an image on it can be subject to many different
descriptions of itself. Whilst there are no diachronic elements, we can
ask about the synchronic aspects. Do each of these descriptions relate
to same thing? What is it that adding descriptions (e.g. more pictures)
contributes to the commmunication? Artists, poets and musicians, working
within the constraints of their own media, have to grapple with similar
questions.</p>

<div class="section" id="ezra-pound-on-poetry-and-chinese-ideograms">
<h4>Ezra Pound on Poetry and Chinese Ideograms<a class="headerlink" href="#ezra-pound-on-poetry-and-chinese-ideograms" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Poetry presents an alternative way of thinking about multiple
descriptions. When considering the ways in which a poem communicates,
Ezra Pound pointed that the technique of its composition was similar to
the construction of traditional Chinese ideograms:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“In tables showing primitive Chinese characters in one column and the
present ‘conventionalized’ signs in another, anyone can see how the
ideogram for man or tree or sunrise developed, or ‘was simplified
from,’ or was reduced to the essentials of the first picture of man,
tree or sunrise.</p>
<p>+:——————————+:————+
| <strong>Symbol</strong>                    | <strong>Meaning</strong> |

| <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(=\)</span> Man                       |             |
+——————————-+————-+</p>
<p>[&#64;pound_abc_2011 21]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>With the kind of overlaying of descriptions that Pound describes in
Chinese writing, he explains how it is that words are assembled from
other words. To articulate ‘red,’ for example, Pound asks</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“How can he do it in a picture that isn’t painted in red paint? He
puts (or his ancestor put) together the abbreviated pictures of</p>
<p>That, you see, is very much the kind of thing a biologist does (in a
very much more complicated way) when he gets together a few hundred or
thousand slides, and picks out what is necessary for his general
statement. Something that fits the case, that applies in all of the
cases.” [&#64;pound_abc_2011 22]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Pound’s argument here is that in order to make a distinction about
‘red,’ multiple descriptions have to be coordinated. The point is
fundamental: any distinction requires multiple descriptions to be
coordinated. Conversation is the necessary process of upholding
distinctions through coordinating multiple descriptions. A final analogy
to illustrate the point can be taken from music. In music ‘descriptions’
in the form of melodies are overlaid on top of one another in what is
called ‘counterpoint,’ of which J.S. Bach provides the supreme examples:</p>
<p><img alt="Synchronic and Diachronic multiplicity inmusic" src="_images/bach1.jpg" />{width=”\textwidth”}</p>
<p>At the very simplest level, the combination of the two lines of music,
each of which is a coherent melody in its own right, describes a sense
of harmony and dynamic drive which each melody on its own cannot convey.
At the same time, each individual melody essentially describes very
similar patterns: there is an alternation between fast and slow notes,
between rising patterns and falling patterns and in harmonic movement.
In each individual melody, there is an alternation between things which
are expected and things which are surprising. The balance between what
is expected and what is surprising is mirrored in each line of melody:
each might be regarded as an <em>alternative description</em> of the <em>same
thing</em>.</p>
<p>In video, the counterpoint is between the images which are presented to
the viewer, the words that are spoken, the tone of the voice that is
speaking, the speech rhythm, the pace of different shots, the movement
of the camera, and any background music. In analysing the video’s
counterpoint like this, it is possible to examine each of these elements</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>the text, the pitch, the image. The experience of watching a video,
just like the experience of listening music, is one of being emotionally
engaged as the different elements of surprise overlap one another. But
here there is a question: if the result of this complex ‘counterpoint’
of descriptions is ultimately an emotion, in what sense can any analysis
of such counterpoint be <em>objective</em>?</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="objectivity-and-analysis">
<h2>Objectivity and Analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#objectivity-and-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The contextual frame of any analytical distinction, whether it is an
analysis of art, student work or student grades, is inescapable. Every
distinction is framed by other distinctions, including those
distinctions which are out-of-scope if we are to simply focus on the
events in question (for example, in a video). While some research
methodologies in the social sciences require that researchers
‘<em>bracket-out</em>’ contextual factors (for example, ‘Grounded Theory’
[&#64;glaser_discovery_1999]) there is an implicit assumption behind such
bracketing-out that each element does not exist in a relation to others.
Cybernetic analysis, on the other hand, embraces the idea of <em>relation</em>
and rejects the possibility that any single distinction can ever be
objectively determined. By contrast, every distinction, and every
alternative description, indicates - but does not determine - the
<em>constraints</em> within which it is produced. Descriptions layered upon
descriptions reveal constraints at multiple levels: constraints of bias
in individual perception, constraints of social norms in language,
educational practice, media practice, and so on.</p>
<p>Cybernetic analysis aims to articulate the relations of constraints, and
<em>to some extent</em> these can be apprehended by overlaying multiple
descriptions of the same thing. However, whilst an analytical indication
of constraint can be useful, it itself is constrained by the range of
observations made, the bias of the analyst, the mathematical tools and
techniques deployed, and the implicit assumptions about the world which
underpin those tools.</p>
<p>Cybernetics is concerned with steering. Imagine that you are driving
over unknown territory attempting to navigate to a destination whose
location you are only vaguely informed about. You begin with a basic
hypothesis about how to get there, and the challenges that lie ahead.
The environment presents constraints in the form of an uneven road
surface, or maybe the occasion cliff-edge. You will be careful: which
means that at each step of the way you will be <em>learning</em> about your
environment, and the kinds of constraints that you have to be aware of.
You will be creating a working hypothesis of how this environment is,
and every now and then something will happen which surprises you,
causing you to change your hypothesis.</p>
<p>In this process of steering, constraints are identified <em>negatively</em>, as
the difference between what is expected and what is perceived. By
reflecting on the things that are perceived, an increasingly rich
picture of constraint emerges, which occasionally will change the
hypotheses about what to expect.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="steering-understanding">
<h2>Steering Understanding<a class="headerlink" href="#steering-understanding" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A learning resource such as a book or a video, can be thought of as a
‘terrain’ across which one must navigate. As we steer, the map that we
build is our ‘knowledge’ of the resource. This helps us to predict some
things in the resource, but every now and then, we encounter something
which surprises us. At such a point, we have to refine our knowledge and
recalibrate our map.</p>
<p>YouTube has rapidly become a first point of call for aspiring learners
of computer programming, plumbing, car maintenance, theoretical physics,
languages and philosophy. Educational video shares an important feature
of a face-to-face encounter: it presents simultaneous multiple
descriptions, just as we do in face-to-face conversation. But
educational video does not appear to be <em>conversational</em>. If people are
learning from videos, where is the conversation?</p>
<p>Here we must revisit the theory of conversation so far presented:
conversation is a process of resolving multiple descriptions of the same
thing. It is more than just talking. We might ask, for example, “Is
there a conversation which occurs between a learner and a long-dead
author?” The important issue, which draws attention back to the
importance of multiple description, is that the learner is faced not
only with a book, but with a <em>body of work</em>, commentaries about that
work, studies of the author by others alongside biographical details
about an author. In other words, there are many descriptions. The
process of uncovering the meaning of those many descriptions is the
process that the learner has to engage in through reading, studying and
talking to others. Long dead authors <em>teach</em> not in direct conversation
with a learner, but through the presentation of multiple descriptions of
their ideas which seep into a culture, and which demand of the learner
that new conversations with others similarly engaged with author’s work
are a necessary component in being able to piece together its meaning.
In the process, the culture is renewed.</p>
<p>Just as a learner will pore over pages in a text, reading and
re-reading, so with an educational video, learners will replay key
moments to see new things that they might have missed first time.
Equally importantly, through social media, they will share the video
resources they discover: the video <em>object</em>, by virtue of the complexity
of the multiple descriptions it contains (just like the book) becomes a
focus for conversation among those who share a fascination for it. It
helps to establish conversations within which the relationship between
the parties is <em>controled</em> by each party such that the ‘dance’ doesn’t
break down.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conversing-and-control-requisite-variety">
<h2>Conversing and Control: Requisite Variety<a class="headerlink" href="#conversing-and-control-requisite-variety" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Cybernetics was originally defined as ‘<em>the art and science of control
in man and machine</em>’[&#64;wiener_cybernetics:_2013]. We have however, spoken
of a learning conversation being a dance, and that the dance can either
flow, or it can break down - sometimes necessitating the teacher to
recalibrate their approach. This issue of dancing and conversation is
precisely the same as the issue of <em>control</em>. Unfortunately however, the
word ‘control’ has some unpleasant associations with coercion, a loss of
free will, authoritarianism, and so on. So we require a more precise
definition of control. Stafford Beer explains the cybernetic sense of
control like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Control is an attribute of a system. This word is not used in the way
in which either an office manager or a gambler might use it; it is
used as a name for <em>connectiveness</em>. [&#64;beer_cybernetics_1965]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Control simply refers to the manifest <em>connection</em> between dancers whose
moves complement each other, and who participate in a whole system which
exhibits coherence in its behaviour. Control is evident in two people
having a conversation in which they are both deeply committed and
involved. It is also evident in a game of football between two teams, or
between two people playing a game of chess.</p>
<p>Cybernetics was originally developed in the 1940s as an approach to
studying the dynamics of mechanical control systems. Norbert Wiener’s
mechanical control problem was how to shoot incoming aircraft. The
mechanical problem involved feedback: the incoming object’s position and
trajectory would change, and as it did, so the calibration of the
counter-measures had to be adjusted. The incoming aircraft and the
missile targetting system engaged in a dance.</p>
<p>The dancing between two people could be abstracted to the ‘dancing’
between two complex systems. Ross Ashby was a pioneer of early
cybernetics, who in 1948 built a machine which ‘danced’ with itself,
calling it a ‘homeostat.’ From observing the behaviour of the homeostat,
Ashby devised a ‘law’ of control which has dominated the discipline of
cybernetics ever since. What became know as the ‘Law of Requisite
Variety’ states that any complex system can only be controlled by
another system of equal of greater complexity.</p>
<p>All organisms exist in environments which have much more variety than
any individual organism: consequently the search for requisite variety
is a continual process. The same is true in education: teachers have
much less variety than a classroom full of children. Where teachers can
produce a few descriptions of what they want to communicate, 30 children
can produce vastly more descriptions in what they might say and in how
they behave. How do the teachers survive?</p>
<p>To have <em>requisite</em> variety means that something has to be done to the
imbalance of variety. Somehow, the variety of the environment must be
<em>attenuated</em>, while the actions of the organism must be <em>amplified</em>. In
all control situations, the amplifiers and attenuators can be
identified. In the classroom, the attenuators are obvious: chairs in
rows and rules of the class serve to attenuate the variety of 30
children. At the same time, the teacher amplifies their actions: they
use technologies like textbooks, blackboards, chalk, or (now)
Smartboards, interactive learning resources and Multiple Choice Quizzes.
Another aspect of the way in which variety is managed is that
attenuation and amplification cannot simply be an ad-hoc process: rules
of the classroom, the layout of chairs and desks and the overall plan of
the lesson are all things which are designed. As we will see in Chapter
4, there is always a <em>meta-system</em> which coordinates the coordination of
amplification and attenuation. Ashby and Conant later codified the need
for coordinating the regulation: it necessitated that the regulator had
to contain a design, or a model, of the system of which it was part:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>every good regulator of a system must be a model of that system
[&#64;conant_every_1970]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Amplification and attenuation are applied both synchronically and
diachronically. Synchronically, the structural conditions of an activity
where, for example, learners work in groups involves the teacher
managing the ways the students work with each other. Diachronically, the
teacher will vary the lesson activities as time progresses: too much of
doing the same thing will get boring and threaten the control in the
class. In education, the Law of Requisite variety means coordinating the
dance of the conversation in the class. The achievement of Ashby’s
cybernetics was that the coordinating processes could be explored
abstractly in mathematics, in machines and in humans.</p>

<div class="section" id="ashby-s-dancing-machine">
<h2>Ashby’s Dancing Machine<a class="headerlink" href="#ashby-s-dancing-machine" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The behaviour of Ashby’s Homeostat raises important questions about
coordination, the management of variety and communication. The machine
comprised four units which were connected to each other in such a way
that the output from one fed into the input of another. The four dials
on the Homeostat each articulated a particular description - or a guess</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>as to what the settled value might be between them. The mechanism that
connected them ensured that this complexity between the dials led to a
gradual process of accommodation of the dynamics of each of the other
dials. Psychologist Paul Watslawick, whose own practice of family
therapy exploited cybernetic ideas, explained the mechanism as he
experienced it:</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<div><p>a disturbance caused in any one of [the self-regulating sub-systems]
affects, and is in turn reacted to, by the others. This means that no
subsystem can attain its own equilibrium in isolation from the others,
and that Ashby has been able to prove a number of most remarkable
“behavioural” characteristics of this machine. Although the circuitry
of the homeostat is very simple when compared with the human brain or
even with other manmade devices, it is capable of 390,625 combinations
of parameter values, or, to make the same statement in more
anthropomorphic terms, it has that number of possible adaptive
attitudes to any changes in its internal or external medium. The
homeostat achieves its stability by going through a random search of
its combinations, continuing until the appropriate internal
configuration is reached. This is identical with the trial-and-error
behaviour of many organisms under stress. In the case of the homeostat
the time required for this search may range from seconds to hours.
[&#64;watzlawick_pragmatics_1968 195]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The homeostat exemplified Ashby’s law: a solution was only reached when
each dial transduced the output of every other dial such that a stable
distinction could be made. The stable distinction was the state where no
dial could occupy any other state than the one that it had settled on.</p>

<p>While Ashby was developing his theories and machines, an American
electrical engineer, Claude Shannon, who had been present at a number of
the cybernetics conferences in the late 1940s, was dealing with the
problem of calculating the bandwidth necessary to transmit
telecommunications signals over a distance such that interference on the
line would not impair the effectiveness of the communication. Shannon’s
problem, like Ashby’s, concerned the imbalance of complexity between the
receiver of a message and the combined complexity of the sender plus the
transmission medium subject to noise. Shannon had to work out the
conditions in which the variety which makes up the symbols in a message
could be transmitted from one end of a line and reproduced at the other
end accurately. This required a two-sided transduction process. Shannon
explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The input to the transducer is a sequence of input symbols and its
output a sequence of output symbols. The transducer may have an
internal memory so that its output depends not only on the present
input symbol but also on the past history. [&#64;shannon_mathematical_1949
57]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In other words, in order to transmit over a noisy medium, the first
transduction process encoded the message in such a way that enabled it
to withstand degradation in the signal, and the second transduction
process decoded the encoded (but degraded) transmission at the other
end.</p>
<p>Shannon’s first challenge was to think of a way of characterising
mathematically what was encoded and what was decoded. Most message
comprise symbols: in English those symbols are elements in an alphabet.
However, the alphabet is not distributed in messages evenly - if it was
then all our messages would look like “abyfhkwPoz jkGriiWhcjfkq.”
Messages carry significance because the distribution of symbols in a
message is not uniform. So:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>THE CAT SAT ON THE MAT</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>contains the symbols with the number of occurrences as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>A = 3<br />
C = 1<br />
E = 2<br />
H = 2<br />
M = 1<br />
N = 1<br />
O = 1<br />
S = 1<br />
T = 5\</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Letters in a message vary according to probability of their occurrence,
so in the above example, T is the least surprising/most probable letter.
A non-alphabetic character like ‘#’ would in most English sentences be
the most surprising character (which is why we use ‘#’ as a way of
indicating a special function in platforms like Twitter).</p>
<p>The critical determinant of success of communication of a message was
dependent on whether the variety of the message could be reproduced at
the receiving end. In other words, whether the receiver could display
the same variety of behaviour in transducing the transmission as the
sender displayed in sending it. Shannon’s double-transduction process
expressed exactly the same principle as Ashby’s law, and this meant that
his mathematical solution to his problem had potentially much wider
applications in cybernetics.</p>
<p>Shannon then had to solve the problem of how to measure the variety of a
message mathematically in order to calculate the bandwidth to transmit
it. Owing to the uneven distribution of letters in messages, he realised
that this had to do with probabilities: the variety of the message was
equivalent to the ‘average surprisingness’ of characters in the message.</p>
<p>Fortunately for Shannon, an equation already existed in physics which
would do the job with a little adjustment. Boltzmann’s measure of
‘entropy’ in the state of a thermodynamic system was a calculation based
on the probability that the atoms in a sample of a material would have a
particular degree of excitation or energy. If heat was localised to a
small area of a material (as it might be when a localised heat source
like a blow-torch is initially applied to a metal object), then the
distribution of probabilities of different energy levels in that small
area indicated that in a small area the atoms were excited to a similar
high degree, where the rest of the material may all have the same low
temperature. Boltzmann realizes that this value could be arrived at
through the sum of the <em>logs</em> of the probabilities weighted by each
probability. So if the small area which is hot is signified as 1, and
the cold area as 0, then the average surprisingness of excitation was
low. Over time, heat spreads out - which means that the state of the
atoms becomes more disordered. Consequently, the entropy increases.</p>
<p>Shannon took the same approach. Instead of energy levels of atoms, he
took the probabilities of different symbols in a message. The average
surprisingness of the message could be calculated by summing the <em>logs</em>
of the probabilities weighted (multiplied) by each probability.</p>
<p>This made Shannon’s communication problem a mathematical problem where
the variety of the transmitted message and the received message could be
calculated. Moreover, it provided a way of considering what the
transduction process needed to do to encode the message in a way which
would survive transmission and decoding. Shannon represented his
double-transduction setup in the diagram shown in Figure
<a class="reference external" href="#ref:shannon">2.3</a>{reference-type=”ref” reference=”ref:shannon”}.</p>
<p><img alt="Shannon's basic transduction diagram of communication between senderand receiver" src="_images/shannon.jpg" />{#ref:shannon}</p>
<p>The diagram indicates the basic hurdle of communication - some kind of
amplification was required to overcome noise on the medium. One solution
was to add extra bits to the message to ensure that the differences in
entropy between the different symbols would still be apparent even if
the transmission was degraded. To do this, Shannon argued that
<em>redundancy</em> was a critical element in message transmission. Indeed,
redundancy was the principle behind the information in the message in
the first place because of the distribution of letters. Redundancy could
be added either by repeating a message, or by adding extra bits of
information which could be used to check the transmission was
successful, or by representing the same message in a different way. If
extra bits were to be added, then it meant that the bandwidth between
the sender and the receiver should be increased. If repetition was the
answer, transmission would be slower. So by calculating the entropy of
the message, the degradation of the signal on the medium over a
distance, and the amount of redundancy that was needed to be added in
order to counter the effects of degradation, Shannon was able to
calculate the necessary bandwidth for transmission.</p>

<h2>The Mathematics of Being Informed<a class="headerlink" href="#the-mathematics-of-being-informed" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Shannon’s entropy calculations are detailed in his book “A Mathematical
Theory of Communication” [&#64;shannon_mathematical_1949], and this has
since become known as ‘Information theory.’ Information theory underpins
the principles of digital communication, compression and encryption.
Without it, we would not have the basic mechanics of the internet, let
alone the transmission of video, audio, pictures or text which is
carried over it. It has found application beyond technology: in biology,
Shannon entropy has been used as an index of biological growth
[&#64;ulanowicz_third_2009], of ecosystem development
[&#64;odum_fundamentals_1959] and epigenesis [&#64;deacon_incomplete_2012]; in
physics, it is used to explore quantum mechanics and quantum computing
[&#64;lloyd_programming_2007]; in the social sciences, it is used to explore
scientific discourse and big data [&#64;leydesdorff_knowledge-based_2006];
in geography, it is used to understand urban development
[&#64;haken_information_2015]; in neuroscience it is used to explore the
working of the brain [&#64;ashby_design_2013]; in anthropology, it is used
to explore cultural behaviour [&#64;bateson_steps_1987]; in the arts, it is
used to explore aesthetics [&#64;kanach_formalized_1992].</p>
<p>Information theory measures the complexity of a message by calculating
the probability of each event and producing an index of the ‘average
surprisingness’ of a sequence of messages expressed in terms of the
number of ‘bits’ or on-off switches which would be required to transmit
a message of this complexity.</p>
<p>To give an insight into how this is measured, we can consider a very
simple message:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>A A A A A A A A</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>For each symbol in a message, we can calculate its surprisingness by
multiplying its probability by the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(log\)</span> of its probability. The total
surprisingness of the message is the sum of this calculation for all the
different symbols which appear. With 8 A’s, the number of symbols is 1,
and the probability of A appearing is 1. The <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(log\)</span> of 1 is 0, therefore,
the surprisingness of the message is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1 \times 0 = 0\)</span>. But what about
this:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>A A B A A A A B</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Here, there are two symbols, so we calculate the probability of each
symbol and multiply it by the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(log\)</span> of the probability of each symbol.
So the probability of A is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{6}{8}\)</span> and the probability of B is
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4}\)</span>. Information theory calculates <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(log\)</span>s to
base 2. This is because in digital signals, something can be either <em>on</em>
or <em>off</em>. Shannon’s central problem which he sought to address was how
many <em>on/off</em> switches would be required to transmit a particular
message with a particular degree of surprisingness. There had to be
enough switches to generate the <em>variety</em> of different symbols that were
required to be sent.</p>
<p>So we can use <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(log_2\)</span> to calculate <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\log_2 \frac{6}{8} = -0.415\)</span> and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\log_2 \frac{1}{4} = -2\)</span>. Now we multiply these <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(log\)</span> values with the
probability of those values to give <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{6}{8} \times -0.415 = -0.311\)</span>
and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{1}{4} \times -2 = 0.5\)</span>. Adding them together gives <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(-0.811\)</span>.
So the addition of an extra symbol produces quite a jump in entropy.
Note, if there was only one B in a sea of A’s, then the average
surprisingness would be <em>higher</em>: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\log_2\frac{1}{8} = -3\)</span> and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\log_2\frac{7}{8} = -0.192\)</span>, and multiplying these by the probabilities
gives: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{1}{8} \times -3 = -0.375\)</span> and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{7}{8} \times -0.192 = -0.168\)</span> giving a total of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0.543\)</span>.</p>
<p>Finally, what if we have more symbols and more randomness?</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>A F X P T T U W</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Here the probabilities are:</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Symbol (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span>)</strong>   <strong>Prob.(<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_i\)</span>)</strong>   <strong><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\log_2 p_i\)</span></strong>   <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_i \times \log_2 p_i\)</span>

<hr class="docutils" />
<p>As a result we have a value for the entropy of the message, and if the
communication of the message is successful, then the translated message
would also have this value. But in order to guarantee the transmission
of the message over a noisy medium, we have to encode it in such a way
that the entropy is amplified. This means that we have to <em>add
redundancy</em>.</p>
<p>As we’ve discussed, redundancy might mean repeating the message, adding
extra bits to check the transmission, or to present the same message in
a different way. In fact, whichever technique is used, redundancy
amounts to <em>creating alternative descriptions of the same thing</em>.</p>
<p>At this point, we arrive back at the theme of this chapter: the idea of
multiple descriptions and conversation. Now we have a way of thinking
about multiple descriptions where a mathematical analysis might be
performed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mathematical-analysis-and-video">
<h2>Mathematical Analysis and Video<a class="headerlink" href="#mathematical-analysis-and-video" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The value of Shannon’s entropy as a concept is that the entropy value of
any kind of communication - whether it is words, or the pitch of a
voice, or the movements of the body, or the shifting forms in a video -
can be calculated. In human communication, the main method of ‘adding
redundancy’ that we use is the simultaneous presentation of multiple
descriptions of the same thing. In a noisy room, we might shout a
message, or we might use our hands to gesture (a redundant alternative
description), or we might choose to send a message in a different way.
So what if we analyse the entropy of each of those descriptions?</p>
<p>As we’ve discussed, every description is framed by every other
description, so every entropy value is framed by every other entropy
value. What this means is that it is not entropy itself which matters in
communication, but the constraining effects of the entropies of multiple
descriptions <em>on each other</em>. Communication is carried in the interplay
of redundancies, just as Ezra Pound, Edgar Morin and the music of J.S.
Bach describe.</p>
<p>So, to take a simple example, we might consider a video which presents a
simple message: “Everybody is uncertain about education.” Imagine this
being spoken. One of the descriptions of the message is contained in the
pitch, or prosody of the spoken words. The pitch of speech can be seen
through the Fourier analysis of sound which we introduced in figure 2.1:</p>
<p><img alt="The sound spectrum of speech and the entropy ofpitch" src="_images/everyonespec2.jpg" />{width=”\textwidth”}</p>
<p>The variation in the fundamental tone (the lower thick line) has an
entropy. From the spectral graph, we can see that the upper frequencies
(the grey shades) have a slightly different pattern: both the pitch of
the voice and the timbre have different entropies, as does the rhythmic
patterning of the bands which illustrate the speech rhythm. These
entropies are coexisting and overlap one another.</p>
<p>Imagine that in a video about “Uncertain education,” the pitch of the
words which has an entropy is accompanied by the text, which also has an
entropy. Just as the occurrences of the letters in the alphabet are
distributed according to a probability distribution, so are the words in
a series of sentences. And often in education, the same words may be
repeated for emphasis, but whilst the words might be same (and so the
word entropy is stable), the pitch or the volume of the speech might
change. What unfolds is a dance between the different entropy values
over time that might, if it were plotted over time, look like the
interacting lines of the graph in Figure
<a class="reference external" href="#ref:media">2.4</a>{reference-type=”ref” reference=”ref:media”}.</p>
<p><img alt="Graph of relative entropies of multiple descriptions in media overtime" src="_images/graph1.jpg" />{#ref:media width=”\textwidth”}</p>
<p>In this kind of graph, more elements can be added. Images used to
illustrate the points made will appear on the screen as things are
explained. The rhythm of ‘shots’ also has an entropy: sometimes the
changes on the screen will be more rapid than at other times. The value
of the entropy calculation is that very different descriptions of things
(pictures, sound, words, etc) can be represented over a common scale and
compared.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the entropies of different descriptions change together: this
is particularly noticeable at points of emphasis in a video. If for
example, one wanted to reinforce the message that “education is
uncertain,” the words “education,” “is” and “uncertain” could be spoken
at the same time as they appear on the screen. That would mean that the
entropy of what is heard is the same as the entropy of what is seen. The
point is made with the coordination of many different descriptions of
the same thing simultaneously.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="information-and-education">
<h2>Information and Education<a class="headerlink" href="#information-and-education" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There is much scope for developing sophisticated mathematical techniques
to analyse conversations and different forms of communication. However,
the techniques of information theory itself are merely a way of counting
things. If entropy calculations have any utility, it may lie in the fact
that entropy of many different kinds of phenomena can be represented and
compared on a single axis. It might be the sound of speech, or the range
of colours in a picture, or the variety of hand gestures in teaching,
the value of counting in this way is that defensible statements can be
made and agreed about complex phenomena comprising multiple dimensions.
In this way, the work of poets, composers, film-makers and teachers
connects to a mathematical communication theory.</p>
<p>Does this mean that the effectiveness of educational media and teaching
might be mathematically analysable? Does it mean that in some way, there
is something “objective” about a learning resource or a teacher’s
performance, which might lead to metrics of performance or ‘effective
education?’</p>
<p>To uphold the scientific study of education and technology does not mean
to uphold any kind of naive analytical objectivism. No analysis can be
objective: it is always merely <em>another description</em> - a point for
discussion and debate. This is as true of physics and biology or ‘big
data’ as it is of education or the arts. Having said this, there is a
pattern which emerges and around which the understanding of many people
may be coordinated through a process of conversation. A new description
produced through a new analytical technique is a new element of
redundancy, and this may transform the way existing descriptions are
understood, and this may in turn transform practice.</p>
<p>What matters in this process is the coordination between different
descriptions: the essential processes of conversation. In information
theory, and in cybernetics, those processes are driven by error: the
difference between what one expects (guided by a prevailing theory) and
what actually happens. Ashby argued that cybernetics was a profoundly
different way of doing science from that which had been handed down from
the enlightenment. The cybernetician, he says,</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“Observes what might have happened, but did not” (quoted in
[&#64;krippendorff_ross_2009])</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The detection of error in coordination between theory and practice is a
continual process of identifying how a distinction at one level (or a
transduction) might be different from a distinction at another level.
This process is important if we are to have a cybernetic approach to
education. Educational theory however, rarely considers the ways in
which it might be wrong: it rarely checks if its distinctions at
different levels are consistent or coherent. Interventions in education
are often not made to explore the power of a theory, but instead use a
theory as a justification for plans which may seem like a good idea, but
are not necessarily coherent or comprehensive. If things don’t work,
there is some gap in the model of the world which led to an intervention
being attempted and the nature of the world which prevented that plan
working properly. Ashby’s scientific cybernetic challenge is to identify
those gaps more precisely, and to address the shortcomings of existing
theory.</p>

<h2>Spectra of Vividness<a class="headerlink" href="#spectra-of-vividness" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The internet has unleashed many new possibilities for communicating.
Every new way of communicating overcomes some existing barrier to
communicate. It might (and often is) a constraint of authority or
privilege (for example, publishers), but equally, there are constraints
of space and time, constraints in the dissemination of communication
(broadcasting or marketing) or in the production of communication
material. In the 15^th^ century, the technology of printing introduced a
new means of communicating whose impact in terms of liberation of the
constraints of institutional authority were not realised until the
reformation, 80 years later.</p>
<p>This chapter asks “What happens to social systems when the options for
communicating within them are increased?” There is no way of addressing
this question unless we address the question “what is communication?” At
the heart of the issue is understanding the ways our patterns of
communication, whether they are face-to-face or online, relate to the
ways we become ‘persons.’ As the ways we communicate proliferate, so the
ways in which personal identity is upheld become more complex.</p>
<p>Communication is complex, and technological media of communication
change the dynamics of its complexity. Communication is also
<em>uncertain</em>: we can never be sure if our choice of words, or even our
choice of communication technology, will result in our communication
being understood, or that the results from our communication will be
predictable. Today our choices for communicating are between the
different social media platforms, telephone, email, face-to-face
meetings, blogging, vlogging and so on. Most of these options have been
available to us for little more than a decade. What are the effects of
extra choice?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="teaching">
<h2>Teaching<a class="headerlink" href="#teaching" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Today we consider ‘teaching’ to occur across many media of
communication. Most universities have Virtual Learning Environments, and
many courses exploit different means for having a discussion, from the
face-to-face engagement of the classroom to the threaded discussions of
social media. Technologies now provide many options for students and
teachers to express themselves. The communication involved in teaching -
where one person is attempting to explain their understanding to others</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>has a formal quality which mirrors the process of using many different
media of communication. Teaching, almost invariably, involves saying the
same thing in multiple ways: “Let me explain to you what I mean… Let
me give you an example… Let me tell you a story… What do <em>you</em>
think?” Equally, a teacher might ask a group of students to articulate
numerous other descriptions of whatever it is they are trying to
express.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So there are different choices of utterance and expression that we all
use in daily communication. Indeed, it is not only the selection of
‘telling a story,’ or ‘giving an example,’ but even the ways in which
the tone of voice, the movement of hands and eyes, and the words used
all combine to convey the same thing simultaneously. And on top of these
different forms of expression of the same thing, technology provides new
options for expression: “Let me show you a video on YouTube,” or “Can
you produce your own video of what you understand?” or “Let us explore
this principle through a computer simulation,” or “Can you find other
resources on the internet which explain this?”</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="choice-and-uncertainty">
<h2>Choice and Uncertainty<a class="headerlink" href="#choice-and-uncertainty" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Any increase in options increases uncertainty in the sense that there is
a larger pool of options to choose from. A larger pool of options means
that the task of selecting an utterance becomes more complex - not only
must we decide what we want to say, but we must choose the way (the
medium) to say it.</p>
<p>It would seem at first glance that there is no point in Tweeting
somebody who is not on Twitter. Yet if social media required that people
who wished to communicate in the new medium (and who presumably could
already communicate in another medium) had to select the new medium as a
prerequisite of communication, it is unlikely that the medium would have
established itself, so we require a more formal presentation of the
differences between communication media.</p>
<p>The introduction of a new medium is a change to the choices available
for communication in a communicating system, and effectively an increase
in the variety of that system. Twitter became a new option for the
expression of a communication. As such it was also an increase in
uncertainty: the potential choices for communication were expanded.</p>
<p>However, the principle of Ashby’s Law and Shannon’s information theory
highlights an important difference from the communication discussed in
Chapter 2 and shown in Figure <a class="reference external" href="#ref:shannon">2.3</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”ref:shannon”}. In Chapter 2 we discussed the variety of
different descriptions made by sender and receiver. This assumes that
there is a message intended to be transmitted from person <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a\)</span> to person
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b\)</span>. The transduction is adjusted so as to make the communication
successful between the specific individuals. Communication is successful
when the mechanism whereby person <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a\)</span> generates their utterances becomes
known to person <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b\)</span> and vice-versa. More colloquially, we might say “I
know where you’re coming from…”: the understanding of each others’
generative mechanism is an awareness of the constraints of each other.
Because social media is a broadcast medium, instead of adjusting the
transduction from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a\)</span> so that it communicates to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b\)</span>, a search for
connection is conducted among any number of potential receivers. In
Figure <a class="reference external" href="#ref:socialmedia">3.1</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”ref:socialmedia”} messages are sent out in the hope that
someone somewhere will be able to communicate.</p>
<p><img alt="Multiple contingencies of possible audience on socialmedia" src="_images/socialmedia1.jpg" />{#ref:socialmedia width=”\textwidth”}</p>
<p>An effective transduction means that communication can proceed: but what
is selected are often not utterances but <em>audiences</em>. Social media
expands the audience of any potential communication. That means that any
communication may potentially be viable within a networked set of
possible respondents. By networking such a vast number of possible
respondents, social media effectively increases the variety of the
environment. However, if all communications are potentially viable
communications with <em>somebody</em>, how is one to select which communication
to make? Because of this question, the uncertainty of the selection of
utterances is increased.</p>
<p>‘Confirmation bias’ is the name given to the privileging of selection of
audience over the selection of utterance. Unpleasant phenomena arising
from social media, including ‘trolling’ are varieties of confirmation
bias. Abusive or thoughtless messages are made because a community
exists that will approve of them, and such communities are also likely
approve of the broader disrupting effects of those messages. Awareness
of common constraint is a determining factor in the viability of
communication: that social media is seen as a ‘private’ space by
learners, for example, is a result of the fact that teachers are not
subject to the same constraints as learners, and often learners on
courses are subject to very different constraints from one another. The
selection of audience over utterance can exacerbate political
uncertainty to which institutional structures have to react. Frequently,
the reaction of institutions exacerbates the uncertainty.</p>

<h2>Social Media and the Transduction of Self<a class="headerlink" href="#social-media-and-the-transduction-of-self" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The remarkably rapid mass adoption of social media is a phenomenon which
requires explanation. Given that it is difficult to change patterns of
social behaviour, the transformation of reading habits from print to
online, and the ensuing transformation in the business models of media
organisations, shops, travel agencies, taxi firms, hospitals and
universities must have something to do with a transformation in the
dynamics of communication from transduction between individuals who seek
to communicate with one another, and transduction between individuals
who seek an audience with whom they can communicate.</p>
<p>This adoption process might be presented as ‘innovation
diffusion’[&#64;rogers_diffusion_2003] in a dialectical model which aims to
account for social change. For example, the concept of the <em>early
adopter</em> of technology has become broadly accepted as the first stage of
a dialectical process which leads to social transformation. Small
communities of people engage in new practices and forms of communication
which are largely unknown to others outside this group. Such groups can
be seen as self-organising systems which increase their own complexity
and seek other members with similar complexity so as to absorb the new
complexities of their innovative means of utterance. Within these
groups, there is experimentation about the kinds of communications which
become possible: the parameters of the new complexity of choices of
communication are explored, and its constraints probed. However, this
approach lacks predictive power.</p>
<p>Without disputing the existence of the ‘early adopter,’ their
enthusiastic embrace of new tools or practices might instead be seen to
operate within range of options which has been expanded by new
technology. The early adopter selects a community with whom they can
communicate. The consequent emergence of norms in new practices is part
of the self-organising process of communication. The more users on a
platform, the more potentially viable communications within that
platform are. The self-organising dynamics lead to deeper processes of
distinction-making between different groups: new transduction processes
emerge as one group distinguishes itself from another, and later
adopters of the technology will seek to reinforce transductions they
already uphold, but in new contexts.</p>
<p>This effect is evidenced by the way that Twitter grew assisted by the
adoption of the platform by media celebrities. Adopters of the platform
who followed media figures reinforced their existing personal or
political distinctions with new technological practices. Celebrity
endorsemnent of individuals through social media acknowledgement gave
the impression that ordinary individuals ‘knew’ (and were known by)
their heroes, where in reality all that had happened was the
establishment of an effective transduction. This had the advantage of
reinforcing distinctions of self by associating with a community who are
subject to similar constraints (the medium), and who are likely to
reinforce particular communications. Personal distinctions like this are
an expression of a cultural orientation towards famous people, football
teams, political figures, political views, artists, music and so on. The
connection between the transduction of self with these ‘cultural
transducers’ in the context of technology inevitably results in the
increased adoption of that technology. Through this combination of
transduction of self and technology, the communications of the
individual can exploit the technology by selecting its own audience
without having to develop more sophisticated forms of expression in
order that a communication might be successful with any <em>particular</em>
individual.</p>
<p>Social media has seen an explosion of a world of impersonal contacts
with whom effective communications can occur which reinforce the
transductions of self. Of course, the online communications of social
media combine with face-to-face interactions. While social media seeks
the viability of its communication through seeking an audience, other
forms of communication demand changes to the transduction of self -
often by combining impersonal communications with personal ones. The
selecting of an audience for a communication is not new: scholarly
communication has operated on this principle for centuries. Academic
disciplines, societies and journals are also transducers of particular
forms of communication. But scholarly discourse also provides scope for
challenging the transductions of self: it is not enough simply to make
communications; scholarly communication is also personal. The
relationships between the different levels of transduction, between
personal and impersonal communication, and between face-to-face and
online communication requires a deeper theory. The effect of the new
technology has been to upset the balance in the systemic relationships
between personal and impersonal communications.</p>

<h2>Online and Face-to-face Learning<a class="headerlink" href="#online-and-face-to-face-learning" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The extra choices that the internet provides educators and learners
increases uncertainty about how to act. The existing uncertainties of
education, its purpose, its norms and accepted practices, which were
held in check by a stable lifeworld of custom and practice of the
ancient universities, are destabilised through this increase in options.
Now universities seek to provide traditional face-to-face courses which
attempt to ‘enhance’ learning through technology; or courses which
utilise many ‘modes’ of study ‘blending’ online and face-to-face
engagement; or online-only courses where ‘engagement’ happens in forums
usually within a VLE or MOOC platform. The <em>mode</em> of study used not to
be a choice that either learners nor institutions had to think about.
The internet and its new options has changed this.</p>
<p>In terms of the substantive differences between modes of study, choices
are provided as options for learners, who can chose how to engage in
their learning. Various attempts to determine the factors which attract
individuals to online (and potentially highly profitable) study fill the
pages of educational technology journals making various claims for the
use of technology <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y\)</span>, mobile learning, tablets, e-books, or
bots. Arguments for the effectiveness for any particular technology tend
to be utilitarian, claiming the preferred technology or pedagogical
approach to be an independent variable producing rise in engagement,
test scores, student satisfaction, or retention. Such claims are partly
attempts to simplify the problem of technological selection, addressing
underlying uncertainty.</p>
<p>New technologies may not be independent variables, but they do assist in
overcoming existing constraints. All learners, and indeed all teachers,
operate within various constraints, and their behaviours are determined
by the different strategies which they adopt in order to overcome those
constraints. Employment, family commitments, travel problems, emotional
issues, time, and the demand to achieve a qualification are all
constraints which bear upon learners. The online course presents a way
of overcoming some of those constraints and achieving qualifications.
However, any course brings with it new constraints.</p>
<p>Traditional face-to-face learning imposes constraints including time,
place, travel and assessment. The combination of course constraints on
pre-existing constraints can result in complexity that ultimately
overwhelms a student. Many of these constraints are under-specified and
poorly described. Indicators of emotional wellbeing or disposition to
study are reflected in the interactions between sets of constraints
which can produce signs and symptoms in behaviour which may be easier to
detect and negotiate in a face-to-face context rather than online.</p>
<p>With online learning - at least within formal accredited courses - there
remain imposed constraints of assessment with an expectation for
students to engage with what are sometimes unwieldy institutional
technologies. Additionally, the restricted form within which
conversations have to be conducted, which tend to convey a much narrower
range of possible descriptions, produce problems of coordination of
differences in interpretation, understanding, feedback and so forth. In
combination with other existing constraints of the individual (family
pressures, time, work commitments, etc), this may overwhelm the student
and cause them to drop off the course. The contrast between online and
face-to-face is a contrast in the qualities of conversation which may
help coordinate the different distinctions and constraints that students
operate within.</p>
<p>The word ‘communication’ comes from the Latin ‘communicare’ which simply
means ‘to make common.’ In the previous chapter we discussed the
multiple descriptions involved in conversation, and how the differences
between many descriptions drive the ‘dance’ of coordination which seeks
to ‘make things common.’ Face-to-face conversation reveals many
descriptions of the teacher’s understanding through multiple signals. On
an online forum, the scope for revealing multiple descriptions through
text utterances is more limited. The problem may not be the text medium
itself, which after all is very powerful - but perhaps only if one is
prepared to break the rules and write poetry - but more in the normative
practices of text message exchange with online tools.</p>
<p>Subtle distinctions between different forms and qualities of what might
be called ‘communication’ (or more broadly, ‘human encounters’) are
difficult to draw. To assume that <em>communication</em> is a common activity
which can be conducted in many ways distorts these differences in
quality. Whatever we call <em>communication</em> is framed by the contexts in
which it occurs, and there is no reason for supposing that communication
is <em>the same thing</em> in different contexts: the sharing of messages
online may be fundamentally different from talking face-to-face.</p>
<p>The careless use of language used to draw parallels of communicative
practice between online and face-to-face worlds include other words like
<em>community</em> which face similar semantic problems. The deeper
distinctions have to be drawn around human consciousness: whether what
occurs online or face-to-face is the same essential principle of
<em>communication</em>, individuals remains conscious human beings with a sense
of self and others. For this reason, the study of consciousness must be
a component of the study of communication and the different ways in
which it occurs today.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id1">
<h2>Intersubjectivity<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The founder of phenomenology, Edmund Husserl, realised that in order to
study consciousness it was impossible to escape the problem that
whatever an <em>individual</em> consciousness was (and the very idea of
<em>individual</em> is problematic) the consciousness of one mind was
<em>relative</em> to another. Husserl considered the idea of consciousness
<em>between</em> people, or what he called <em>intersubjectivity</em>. He argued that
consciousness emerged between minds in a shared environment, or
‘lifeworld.’ Husserl was primarily focused on the structure of
consciousness and his idea of intersubjectivity was framed around the
face-to-face interaction between two people. Broader relations to
society, contemporaries and ancestors were not considered
[&#64;schutz_collected_1974].</p>
<p>Alfred Schutz made a connection between Husserl’s intersubjectivity and
Weber’s sociology. Weber, in defining sociology as “a science concerning
itself with the interpretive understanding of social action and thereby
with a causal explanation of its course and consequences”
[&#64;weber_economy_1978] lacked a theory of human understanding, and didn’t
go into much detail about the ways in which human communication occurs.
Schutz saw Husserl’s attempt to describe intersubjectivity as a
corrective to this: a comprehensive theory of mind that could be united
with a theory of social life. However, Schutz felt that Husserl’s
account of intersubjectivity was deficient since Husserl’s main focus in
considering intersubjectivity is one-to-one close relations, and ignores
the broader dimension of what Schutz called the “world of others.” This
world of others, according to Schutz, involves a range of different
kinds of intersubjective relations, from intimate face-to-face
relations, to distance relations with ‘contemporaries’.</p>
<p>The online world presents a clear distinction between face-to-face
engagement and more distant relations. Schutz himself distinguished
between between face-to-face engagement, or what he called a “pure
We-relation,” and engagement at a distance. He identified what he called
a ‘spectrum of vividness,’ arguing that the difference between the
face-to-face world and what he calls the “world of contemporaries” can
be illustrated by the experience of ending a face-to-face encounter:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“The first steps beyond the realm of immediacy are marked by a
decrease in the number of perceptions I have of the other person and a
narrowing of the perspectives within which I view him. At one moment I
am exchanging smiles with my friend, shaking hands with him and
bidding him farewell. At the next moment he is walking away. Then from
the far distance I hear a faint good-by, a moment later I see a
vanishing figure give a last wave, and then he is gone.”
[&#64;schutz_phenomenology_1967 177]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>What Schutz refers to as a “decreasing number of perceptions” suggests
that each of the sensory ‘channels’ which carry alternative descriptions
of the encounter are degraded with distance. What is constructed from
these multiple descriptions is, Schutz suggests (in line with Husserl),
a set of expectations about the communication situation without which
the making of utterances would be impossible.</p>
<p>In other words, I can only write these words now because I have some
expectation of the experience of you as a reader. The meaning of my
words is therefore dependent on the coordination of expectations between
people who communicate: Husserl called these sets of expectations
‘horizons of meaning,’ and so it can be said that what is communicated
are not words but expectations or meanings. Schutz does not suggest that
the process of ‘coordinating expectations’ does <em>not</em> happen at a
distance, but he does suggest that the mechanisms by which meanings are
established and coordinated between people are different in the
situation where there is face-to-face contact, and where there is no
physical co-presence. Schutz’s analysis presents some fascinating
questions: might he say that a ‘pure We-relation’ is still possible at a
distance using a medium of communication (say Skype) which does not
decrease the number of perceptions? What would he say about the
potential for technology to capture face-to-face encounters (as in
lecture capture) so that the experience of the face-to-face encounter
can be replayed later on?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="vivid-simultaneity">
<h2>Vivid Simultaneity<a class="headerlink" href="#vivid-simultaneity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Schutz talks of the ‘vivid simultaneity’ of different sensory channels,
explaining the importance of sharing the passing of time together. He
argues that in the ‘pure We-relation,’ what occurs is a ‘tuning-in’ to
the other’s ‘inner flux of time.’ He used an educational situation to
illustrate this:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“In listening to a lecturer […] we seem to participate
immediately in the development of his stream of thought. But - and
this point is obviously a decisive one - our attitude in doing so is
quite different from that we adopt in turning to our own stream of
thought by reflection. We catch the other’s thought in its vivid
presence […] this is, we are it as a “now” and not as a “just
now.” The other’s speech and our listening are experienced as a vivid
simultaneity. Now he starts a new sentence, he attaches word to word;
we do not know how the sentence will end, and before its end we are
uncertain what it means. The next sentence joins the first, paragraph
follows paragraph; now he has expressed a thought and passes to
another, and the whole is a lecture among other lectures and so on. It
depends on circumstances how far we want to follow the development of
his thought. But as long as we do so we participate in the immediate
present of the other’s thought.” [&#64;schutz_collected_1974 173]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Schutz sees time as part of inner personal life. He elaborated Husserl’s
ideas with the “stream of consciousness” of William James
[&#64;james_stream_2009], and Bergson’s philosophy of time
[&#64;bergson_time_2001]. Yet Schutz also argues that this sharing in the
flux of inner time does not necessarily happen only in face-to-face
communication.</p>
<p>Schutz applied his thinking about intersubjectivity around the
experience of music, where the flow of time and processes of
communication between players and listeners provided his stimulus for
asking “how does music communicate?” - especially since it is devoid of
representational content. Whilst videoed lectures are not devoid of
representational content they nevertheless provide a similar phenomenon
of time passing which ties together Schutz’s interest in the revealing
of inner time of the lecturer and his concern for ‘mutual tuning-in.’
Among the increasingly diverse array of technologies for education,
distinctions can be made between the forms of communication with
‘contemporaries’ who are distant from us (for example, the use of text
media in email), media which use text, but which do so in a synchronous
fashion (for example, text-based real-time chat), media which use
pictures and text in either asynchronous or synchronous fashion (e.g.
Snapchat, image boards, etc), media which offer opportunities to
communicate in artificial shared environments (e.g. Second life,
multiplayer online games) and so on.</p>
<p>Thus it appears that behind Schutz’s distinction between the pure
We-relation and the world of contemporaries is not the issue of physical
co-presence, or synchronous vs asynchronous communication. It is his
concept of the ‘spectrum of vividness,’ which concerns the richness of
multiple description in the communications media. The value of
overcoming the distinction between face-to-face and remote communication
presents new possibilities for conceiving how rich intersubjective
relations, and the associated expectations of individuals might be
coordinated online. But what this means is that the extra choices for
utterances presented by technology are not a matter of one or the other,
but <em>multiple</em> presentations in different media of the same thing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="time-and-expectation">
<h2>Time and Expectation<a class="headerlink" href="#time-and-expectation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The differences between synchronous text-based communication and
asynchronous communication are not just dependent on the nature of the
platform but also on the situation of engagement between participants.
The persistence of utterances expressed through text mean that whilst
synchronous text exchange through time is possible, such text utterances
can also be treated asynchronously: messages can be reviewed, archived
and searched. As Winograd and Flores argued, the storage of online
speech acts in text (for example, email, Twitter) are the foundation of
the fundamental transformation of social coordination: the ability to
track the commitments we make to each other:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>‘Computer-based tools can be used in requesting, creating and
monitoring commitments. They can provide relevant answers to the
question “What do I need to do?” or as we prefer to put it, “What is
the status of my active commitments?”’ [&#64;winograd_understanding_1986
158]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>When considering these basic questions and the ways that individuals
negotiate their relationships with others using technology, there
remains a phenomenological dimension of uncertainty. Behind whatever
text is written to describe a commitment, there is a human relationship
based on the possible meanings of that text which are constrained in
different ways for each person. For each person there exist different
‘horizons of meaning,’ and over time, these horizons of meaning shift as
expectations change in response to other developments in the world of
the individual. Meanings are not static, and indeed it is because of
this that the process of selecting a meaning entails continual
concernful engagement with what happens around us.</p>
<p>In his characterisation of the lecture, Schutz describes how
expectations are changed in response to all kinds of action by the
lecturer. One way to think about this is to consider the multiple
dimensions of description of the communication situation. In this sense,
the <em>vivid simultaneity</em> which Schutz describes in the lecture is
another description of the communication which is taking place. For
Schutz, <em>meaning</em> is tied up with communication and the coordination of
expectations, but the inter-human process is more fluid than the
recording of speech acts. Utterances are made - a verbal comment, a
shrug, a text message or a Facebook ‘Like’ in expectation of the likely
reaction to that utterance by others. Schutz maintains that without
expectation, communication wouldn’t be possible: expectations of each
other form an important part of the lifeworld which each of us
negotiates.</p>
<p>The sociologist Talcott Parsons sought to develop and codify Schutz’s
ideas about expectation into a more systematic theory of human
communication, arguing that what happens in communication was a process
of ‘<em>double contingency</em>’[&#64;parsons_social_2012]. He considered ‘Ego’
communicating with an ‘Alter[ego]’ where Ego’s expectations of Alter’s
behaviour expressed in Ego’s utterances are mirrored by Alter’s
expectations of Ego’s behaviour expressed in Alter’s utterances (Figure
<a class="reference external" href="#ref:doublecontingency">3.2</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”ref:doublecontingency”}). In an extended correspondence
between them, Parsons and Schutz wrestle between a systematic and
systems-theoretical characterisation of communication (which was what
Parsons sought) and a phenomenological and more subtle characterisation
of the development of consciousness in communication (which Schutz was
aiming for) [&#64;grathoff_theory_1978].</p>
<p><img alt="Double Contingency as conceived by Parsons as the dialogue between'ego' and 'alter'" src="_images/doublecont.jpg" />{#ref:doublecontingency
width=”\textwidth”}</p>
<p>Parsons, like Schutz, regarded communication as the <em>coordination of
expectations</em>. This is a view which was further developed by Niklas
Luhmann in a more thoroughgoing cybernetic presentation (see below).
Behind Schutz’s account of the lecture there is a fundamental question:
“How are expectations coordinated in this face-to-face encounter?” The
question for those concerned with the nature of communication in media
other than face-to-face is: “How are expectations shaped in text
messaging, email, online forums, video, computer games, and so forth?”
More profoundly, the question is how communication systems specify their
mechanisms for selecting meaning.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="expectation-participation-and-media">
<h2>Expectation, Participation and Media<a class="headerlink" href="#expectation-participation-and-media" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Luhmann’s cybernetic communication theory built on Parson’s idea of
double-contingency. He attempted to understand how meanings were
communicated, and in the process to unpick how expectations were formed,
influenced by Shannon’s information theory, and the cybernetic biology
of Humberto Maturana [&#64;maturana_autopoiesis_1980]. Luhmann argued that
all communications could be broken-down into three components:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>a selection of the information to be communicated</p></li>
<li><p>a selection of the manner of the utterance (i.e. the way the
information is to the conveyed)</p></li>
<li><p>a selection of the understanding of the message (by the person
receiving it).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these selections, Luhmann argued, was probabilistic in the same
way that Shannon’s communication theory was probabilistic: communication
could be probable or improbable according to the extent to which the
resulting communication operated as an effective transduction between
communicating parties.</p>
<p>At a simple level, communication is improbable if the form of utterance
is not an available selection for the person receiving the message. A
message written in highly academic language is not available for
interpretation by those not familiar with that language, or a message
communicated via a particular medium is not available for reception to
those without access to the medium. More deeply, improbable
communications result when <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span>’s expectation of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span>’s behaviour in the
light of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span>’s utterance is wrong. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> might be met with a response from
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> which might surprise them, or they might be met with silence. If
this is a silence in a face-to-face setting, then there will be other
signals which give a clue as to how <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span>’s expectations are wrong, and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> will have a chance to recalibrate their model of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span>. If the silence
occurs online, then <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> has little to go on in terms of attempting to
recalibrate their model of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span>. Worse still, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> doesn’t know if it is a
problem with the particular medium of communication, or if it is a
problem with the way the message was articulated, or whether it was a
problem of the meaning that was attempting to be conveyed.</p>
<p>The practical problem of online communication is ‘how is it possible to
acquire multiple descriptions of a communication through a restricted
distance medium?’ In response to this, some simple solutions present
themselves including:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>exploiting multiple communications technologies (e.g. phone, email,
text message)</p></li>
<li><p>exploring the history of communication for patterns which might
provide deeper insight into the inner world of the learner</p></li>
<li><p>using data analysis techniques to identify deeper patterns of
behaviour</p></li>
<li><p>exploit technologies which are richer in their multiple descriptions
(e.g video)</p></li>
<li><p>organise activities designed to attenuate the choices of behaviour
by learners (for example, very simple engagement exercises), so as
to hone-in on the nature of the problems.</p></li>
<li><p>make surprising communications which are designed to jolt or disrupt
participants</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The critical point here is that each of these techniques is effectively
part of what might otherwise be called an <em>educational</em> process. The
exploitation of multiple media of communication and the organisation of
different kinds of communicative activity are precisely the kinds of
interventions which a teacher might make with a student. The analytical
approach to past performance - whilst it has today become labelled as
‘learning analytics’ - is something which teachers have always done in
an informal way as they have attempted to understand their learners
better. And the skilful making of surprising interventions is the
prerogative of the teacher who is looking to probe aspects of the
knowledge and understanding of a student in ways to which the student
may not have any response prepared. Teachers seek effective
transductions with their students and require the flexibility to try
many different approaches to establish viable communications.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-proliferation-of-lifeworlds-in-education">
<h2>The Proliferation of Lifeworlds in Education<a class="headerlink" href="#the-proliferation-of-lifeworlds-in-education" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Husserl and Schutz both referred to the concept of the ‘lifeworld’ as
the <em>context</em> within which intersubjective engagement occurs. The
technological transformation of the university is a transformation of
the lifeworld of education: it is a change in the context of experience.
Yet, in the same way that technology has amplified the number of options
for acting, so it has multiplied the number of lifeworlds we might
choose to live in. It is not a matter of the lifeworld of the
traditional university being replaced with a new technological one. The
one shared environment within which expectations could be coordinated
has changed into multiple lifeworlds between which individuals move in
and out. Even in face-to-face settings like lectures, students will
often inhabit different lifeworlds as they explore social media or other
online distractions. As a result, the intersubjective tuning-in process
becomes more difficult because the we must now account for the variation
in the media of communication.</p>
<p>Because of the difficulty in tuning-in to the real flux of lived
experience of others that would be possible in face-to-face
communication, anxiety often drives the participation in the different
online lifeworlds we inhabit, where non-engagement carries an implicit
threat to social status. For example, the motivation for entering and
staying in the lifeworld of social software can be the fear of not being
“in the loop,” of getting “left behind,” or one’s professional status
being put at risk through a lack of online social presence
[&#64;elder-vass_profit_2016]. The proliferation of media of communication
invites the creation of new artificial risks by institutions and
technology corporations to keep people within <em>their</em> lifeworld, as they
seek to maintain the coherence of their communications and their
business models.</p>
<p>The proliferation of lifeworlds means travelling through one and then
another, or even participating in many simultaneously. What happens when
students are in a lecture not really listening, but browsing Facebook?
On the one hand, students are together, aware of each others’ presence,
and of the presence of the lecturer. At the same time, the tuning-in
which is the fundamental constituent of the pure We-relation may not
occur because each person is in their own world. To explain this, Schutz
makes a distinction here between We-relations and Thou-relations:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“in the face-to-face situation, directness of experience is essential,
regardless of whether our apprehension of the Other is central or
peripheral and regardless of how adequate our grasp of him is. I am
still ‘Thou-oriented’ even to the man standing next to me in the
subway.” [&#64;schutz_phenomenology_1967 176]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In other words, the togetherness of the lecture does create some degree
of connection, and between learners within this context, they may well
tune-in to one another as they text each other, or discuss afterwards
how boring or great it was. In this sense, the impact of the ‘quality of
teaching’ on learner experience may be difficult to predict. Bad
lectures can create a context of shared experience as well as a good
one. However, if a lecturer is seen to be consistently bad, students
will tune their shared expectations with one another and stop attending,
thereby removing the possibility of a shared experience. In this sense,
shared expectations of the environment are important in establishing the
conditions for the possibility of conversation and engagement.</p>
<p>Transformations in the common environment of learning can therefore,
have a beneficial impact on learning, just as it is possible to make
changes to any environment which make things better, whether in the
creation of public parks or particular ways of providing resources and
tools where everyone understands what is required of them. These
interventions are changes to the lifeworld which produce transformations
in the ‘horizons of meaning’ of each individual.</p>
<p>Lifeworlds are contexts within which time passes. Schutz argues that the
pure We-relation occurs when the passing of time <em>and</em> the ‘community of
space’ is shared. However, experiences with Skype, or simultaneous
online gaming, or an extended Twitter chat can produce similar
experiences to the ‘tuning-in’ that Schutz describes in the pure
We-relation:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“I speak of another person as within reach of my direct experience
when he shares with me a community of space and a community of time.
He shares a community of space with me when he is present in person
and I am aware of him as such, and, moreover, when I am aware of him
as this person himself, this particular individual, and of his body as
the field upon which play the symptoms of his inner
consciousness.”[&#64;schutz_phenomenology_1967 163]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Schutz points out that the awareness of the Other becomes richer as each
becomes aware that they ‘get older together’ [&#64;schutz_making_1951]. In
this sense of the shared passing of time, all there is to distinguish
between the face-to-face encounter and the Twitter chat is the ‘spectrum
of vividness’ of sense-data between people.</p>
<p>The emphasis on the passing of time in interpersonal relations suggests
that ‘sharing’ the flux of time is the shared experience of another’s
routine, repetition and habit. The analytical content of such repetition
or habit must be in some ways “redundant information” in Shannon’s
sense: they amount to multiple descriptions of the same thing, or the
expression of constraints within which utterances are formed.
Leydesdorff has suggested that such redundancy can be seen as
superfluous ideas - dreams of new projects which will forever be
unfulfilled, remote considerations of unlikely possibilities, and so on
[&#64;leydesdorff_mutual_2014]. Whatever they represent (and one can only
speculate) they are the “ground” upon which the “figure” of meaningful
interaction is produced. In human consciousness, redundancy frames
practice.</p>
<p>Understanding the coordination of expectations across different media
and modes of communication is the central question in being able to
understand the ways learning experiences emerge online and face-to-face.
Online learning does not mean one medium of communication has replaced
another. It means that the selection of <em>means</em> of utterances has been
expanded, and that the selection of utterances and meanings themselves
vary according to the media of communication used: we say similar things
in different ways in different contexts, whether online or offline. What
has not been articulated are the ways in which movement from one medium
of communication to another contributes to the process of reinforcing,
deconstructing and reconstructing what I called earlier the
‘transductions of self’: the configuration of personal identity which is
gradually transformed by education.</p>
<p>It was suggested earlier that within the scope of social media the
transduction of self can be reinforced through a process of selecting an
audience, rather than selecting an utterance. Within the ‘pure
We-relation’ of face-to-face engagement, the transduction must entail
transformation within the communicating parties because a successful
communication is down to them alone: there is no alternative audience.
Therefore, within the communication context which is rich in synchronic
multiple descriptions (which could be face-to-face, or real-time online
video), there has to be adjustment to the transduction within the
parties as they seek to embellish their understanding with multiple
descriptions (i.e. adding redundancy).</p>
<p>Putting this in simpler terms, it means that in face-to-face
communication we have to really think about what we say. We have to
actively build a model of the person we are talking to, how they will
respond to what we say next. Critically, this thinking involves
generating new ways of saying the same thing, so that if the person
didn’t understand it the first time we attempted to say what we meant,
we can find a new way of saying it. To extend the analogy with Shannon’s
information theory, we have to generate redundancy to overcome the
‘semantic noise’ between us [&#64;leydesdorff_mutual_2014]. For this reason,
the face-to-face encounter is critically important in exercising the
capacity to generate multiple descriptions of the same thing. It is for
a similar reason that people often say “one only understands something
properly when one tries to teach it to someone else.”</p>
<p>To see Schutz’s tuning-in as the interaction and overlapping of
individual redundancies (routines and habits), deepens an explanatory
framework which makes the distinction between different forms of
interpersonal online engagement. When people come together in classrooms
there are natural overlaps between the redundancies of expectation
concerning the situation that people engage in. In the face-to-face
environments of school and university, some aspects of ritualised
practice are codified in the form of timetables, curricula and
assessments. Many distance-based communications technologies concentrate
on conveying text-based signals with redundancies stripped out for
efficiency. Some forms of social media retain redundant information
(particularly video). More recent forms of social media interactions
encourage explicitly ‘pointless’ interactions, in which redundancies
dominate: Snapchat, Vine, and Twitter all encourage play with
redundancies within tight constraints. Moreover, the addictive and
repetitive nature of these social technologies forms its own temporal
redundancy.</p>
<p>In these cases, there is a different kind of tuning-in to one another.
The face-to-face situation presents a balance between the overlapping of
redundancies and the tuning-in to one another, and the conveying of
information. The social media experiments currently underway around us
are helping us to explore the dynamics of communication situations where
there is little redundancy and lots of information, and where there is
little information and lots of redundancy. We have yet to find a way of
using our technologies effectively such that they ‘listen’ in the way we
are capable of listening to each other in face-to-face encounters.</p>

<h2>Conversations between the Lifeworlds<a class="headerlink" href="#conversations-between-the-lifeworlds" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A new tool is a codification of social practice. If the icons, features
and interfaces were not agreed at some level among the community of
users who engage with the tool, then it could not be used according to
the intention of its inventor or designer. All tools are intentionally
designed - even if the tool is not designed to have any practical
purpose. The codification of social practice lies at the nexus between
human-to-human engagement and the human-to-world engagement: an
interface is a feature of the lifeworld which is constructed through
intersubjective processes. Technological interfaces are converters of
codes of expectation: they are precisely the transducers as described by
Simondon as “the margin of indeterminacy between two domains”
[&#64;simondon_mode_2017].</p>
<p>The codification of icons, features and interfaces represent
attenuations of human intersubjectivity. As transducers, they are a
short-hand: a simple description for a complex social process where the
variety of description of those processes has been removed in order to
aid the establishment of a common coordination through the use of tools.
Attenuations take the form of the Facebook ‘Like’ or the Twitter
‘Follow,’ and with many new social tools, the attenuation of
descriptions is a critical feature in being able to gain mass adoption.</p>
<p>Education is a process of conversation where multiple descriptions are
coordinated. In order for this to happen, the lifeworld within which
conversation occurs must also be coordinated. Technology has caused a
proliferation of lifeworlds in education, and this has increased the
uncertainty of communication. However, technology has also created
opportunities for individuals to produce digital artefacts which can
form new shared lifeworlds, or contexts for conversation.</p>
<p>For example, learners or teachers will move from one context to another,
from a face-to-face setting to an online asynchronous setting (like a
blog), or to an online synchronous setting like Skype. Along the way,
artefacts are created and remain within the technological system like a
trail. It may be the blog post that was written in response to the
online meeting, or the tweet that was made during the seminar, or the
photograph that was taken while waiting for the bus, or the Twitch video
that was made of playing a game. These artefacts can then form the
context for a new discussion, which may be face-to-face or online, but
which forms part of a shared lifeworld for intersubjective engagement.
Therefore, while the proliferation of lifeworlds introduces uncertainty
with regard to the traditional practices of education which assumed
everyone was in the ‘same place,’ new intersubjective coordination
becomes possible as a result of the collective creativity of individuals
moving through different lifeworlds.</p>
<p>The problem of what technology has done to education is a problem for
the traditional practices of the university. In proliferating the means
of communication, and proliferating the potential lifeworlds that
students can exist in, it becomes increasingly difficult to see how the
‘one-size-fits-all’ approach of the university can continue to work.
Moreover, as the demand for work-based education increases, so does the
further expansion of potential lifeworlds. This is not to say that there
shouldn’t be lectures or seminars, but it is to say that what happens
when people are together in a single space with the capacity to
simultaneously co-exist in online spaces, has an effect on the nature of
communication that ensues. Creating the conditions for conversation in
the university means now creating the conditions for learner
self-organisation as they move between many different lifeworlds in
their learning. However, this entails rethinking the traditional means
of coordinating conversation: curriculum, lecture, timetable and
assessment may eventually have to give way to technology, creativity,
collaboration and intersubjective judgement.</p>

<h1>Hierarchy and Heterarchy<a class="headerlink" href="#hierarchy-and-heterarchy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<div class="section" id="human-hierarchy-and-natural-order">
<h2>Human Hierarchy and Natural Order<a class="headerlink" href="#human-hierarchy-and-natural-order" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In chapter 1, I considered the problem of making distinctions about
education. All distinctions exist in a context, and the context is made
up of other distinctions which have their own contexts. The process by
which distinctions are made, maintained, adjusted, or abandoned is a
process of transduction. Educational institutions are vehicles for
upholding distinctions about education, including distinctions about
disciplines, research, status and certificates. The context within which
processes to uphold these distinctions operate have been fundamentally
changed by technology. It would be very difficult, for example, to
conduct an ‘assessment of research activity’ (as is done in the UK and
other countries) without the benefit of today’s bibliometric tools.</p>
<p>Partly as a result of such technologies, the environment of education
has become increasingly uncertain, exacerbated by ever increasing
options for action afforded by new technologies. Educational
institutions are not well-adapted to deal with uncertainty. Their
hierarchical structures evolved in a different and more stable world to
attenuate the complexity of the environment, and these structures
struggle to cope with the technologically-transformed environment.</p>
<p>Universities, like churches, schools, armies, governments, corporations
and scout groups, have a boss at the top (a vice-chancellor, president
or rector) and there are departments below them, each with a head, and
under each division there are divisional-heads, with sub-divisions under
them, when finally there are individual teachers whose function is to
ensure learners are successfully taught and there are no complaints
which might cause their superiors problems. Human hierarchies serve
multiple functions. They codify the division of labour within an
organisation, they provide a structure for managing complexity, and -
perhaps most importantly - they provide ‘lines of responsibility’ which
apportion credit and blame to different members of an organisation when
their sections either succeed or fail. Because of this, they also serve
to maintain a degree of conformity with the standards and expectation of
the person at the top of the hierarchy. In a university, hierarchy also
reinforces the structuring of knowledge as it has emerged through the
curriculum. This multi-purpose nature of hierarchy introduces many
contradictions into educational organisation: whilst scholars in an
institution might argue for greater interdisciplinarity and
cross-departmental working, the institutional hierarchy with its
departmental heads and different ‘cost centres’ mitigates against a more
holistic approach to scientific inquiry and education. Such structures
are further reinforced by practices of publishing and
hyper-specialisation within cognate fields.</p>
<p>The underlying principle of hierarchy is <em>attenuation</em>. Highly complex
phenomena which teachers and learners deal with on a daily basis, each
of which carries a rich variety of description has to be squeezed into
bite-sized summaries of ‘what is going on’ that the senior management
team can absorb. In any institutional hierarchy, this attenuation works
both in a ‘vertical’ way, from the bottom of an organisation to the top,
and in a ‘horizontal’ way, whereby each individual has to attenuate the
complexity of the totality of the environment within which they live.
Since each individual is every other individual’s environment, any
organisation features horizontal attenuation at all levels between all
individuals. Figure <a class="reference external" href="#fig:hierarchyattenuate">4.1</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:hierarchyattenuate”} shows this pattern of attenuation
and the division of knowledge in the institutional structure.</p>
<p><img alt="The attenuations of hierarchy" src="_images/Slide5.jpg" />{#fig:hierarchyattenuate
width=”\textwidth”}</p>
<p>This diagram is however, simplistic. Humans, like other animals, shape
their environment to suit themselves. From the attenuation of the
environment to simple organisational principles, humans amplify these
organisational principles by making changes to their environment such
that they find a reliable way of coordinating themselves. This action to
shape the environment represents the opposite of attenuation: it is an
amplification of an individual’s understanding of their environment.</p>
<p>The coalescing of the structure of knowledge with the institution’s
organisational structure means that in modern university departments, a
failure to recruit students, or failure to keep them happy means that
branches of knowledge can be lost through the institution’s anxiety to
maintain its overall viability. At the same time, a failure to maintain
standards deemed appropriate by government can result in sanctions or
the withdrawal of funding. To maintain branches of knowledge in the
institution is to balance competing demands in both providing what is
‘popular’ whilst ensuring sufficient rigour to uphold reputation.</p>
<p>In modern organisations, the attenuation process from bottom to top, and
from the environment to the individual, is driven by <em>information</em>: data
on everything from class attendance, student surveys, pass rates and
student fee income is collected and processed to assist organisational
decision-making. Impressive though this range of data is, such
information serves as a mechanism of attenuation. It is not unusual for
significant environmental threats or operational difficulties to go
undiagnosed before it is too late to do anything about it. Such is the
story of most recent institutional crises from the financial collapse of
banks and corporations, child abuse in the church, illegal behaviour of
journalists, health scandals, abuse of power by Hollywood moguls and the
expenses of politicians.</p>
<p>Shocks from the environment are moments which reveal that the
institution had an incorrect model of its environment and itself: what
it thought was operating with some certainty, suddenly turns out to be
<em>uncertain</em>. Institutions respond to this uncertainty with bureaucratic
processes: there are inquiries, restructures, people responsible are
identified and removed, and so on. The effect and the motivation of
these processes is to preserve the institution’s structure. Often the
result of this is the production of new uncertainty: institutions are
reacting to environmental uncertainties which they themselves helped to
create.</p>
<p>This circular relationship between the maintenance of hierarchical
structure and the generation of uncertainty is shown in Figure
 <a class="reference external" href="#fig:uncertaininstitution">4.2</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:uncertaininstitution”}. It as a positive feedback loop,
driven largely by technology’s creation of new options for action.</p>
<p><img alt="The positive feedback between institutional hierarchy and anincreasingly uncertainenvironment" src="_images/Slide8.jpg" />{#fig:uncertaininstitution width=”\textwidth”}</p>
<p>In contrast to this situation, the natural world, operates on
<em>ecological</em> principles, where what might appear to be hierarchical
elements (for example, the levels of a food chain) are interlinked in
ways which mean that domination by one level over another leads to
catastrophe. Equally, in physiology, the brain is not the ‘boss’ of the
body, but part of a network of functionally-differentiated components
which work together coordinated by signals passed through the central
nervous system. In nature, in place of hierarchy, we see circularity.
This is because natural structures seek viability and adaptability in
response to a changing environment. Circular organisational structures
help achieve this through continual organic adaptation.</p>
<p>While attenuation is a large part of what human hierarchy does, were the
errors of communication which result from hierarchical attenuation to
exist in nature, it would be unlikely that life would be possible.
Therefore, to study the relationship between human hierarchy and natural
organisation requires the study of communication, and the part of
communication which we can see - and which we have some tools to
investigate - is information. Furthermore, a critical component of the
human organisation is the use of technology and the ways in which
technology changes the patterns of communication in institutions. In
approaching this, we first consider how technology can make the
attenuation worse, and exacerbate the pathology of hierarchy producing
what we now call <em>technocracy</em>. Examining this presents some clues not
only as to the relationship between technology and hierarchy, but also
to the ways in which technology might be used differently.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="technology-and-technocracy">
<h2>Technology and Technocracy<a class="headerlink" href="#technology-and-technocracy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The principal way in which attenuation is achieved through technology is
through the use of ‘forms.’ In today’s institutions, ‘forms’ of all
kinds - usually online - are part of professional life. Forms are now
used as methods of assessment for learners (multiple choice quizzes or
other forms of interactive learning), methods of surveying opinion, or
the collection of ‘competency’ data in health or education as we saw in
Chapter 1. Data collected in this way can then be analysed and this
attenuated picture of reality used to support institutional decision
making or learner progress.</p>
<p>The <em>form</em> was developed during the first world war. <em>Form A2042</em> was
the name given to the ‘Field Service Post Card,’ upon which soldiers
could send brief messages home by crossing-out the options which did not
apply. Paul Fussell claims it was</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>‘the progenitor of all modern forms on which you fill in things or
cross out things or check off things, from police traffic summonses to
“questionnaires” and income-tax blanks.’ [&#64;fussell_great_2013 201]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The Field Service Post-Card is an attenuator of description for the
purpose of reinforcing a hierarchy. The concern of the military
officials during the war was the potential damage to morale at home
should soldiers be able to articulate the true horrors of what they were
witnessing. The Field Service Post Card helped with the organisational
effort of managing information, keeping relatives informed (or
misinformed) at home. Its restricted structure prevented soldiers saying
too much. Hierarchies maintain themselves by attenuating the flow of
information between themselves and their environment. Fussell notes that
the form contains no space to say ‘my leg has been blown off’ or ‘I have
been admitted to hospital and am not expected to recover.’</p>
<p>Today’s computer forms do more than attenuate the communication of
individuals. Computer tools attenuate from the end-user to the system,
but they can also <em>amplify</em> the aggregated patterns of behaviour gained
by capturing many people engaging with the form. Modern computer
technology can dynamically adapt the constraints within which users
engage with the system on the basis of real-time analysis of the
behaviour of many thousands of users with their interface. Consequently,
social media platforms present content to users in a way where the
behaviour of users might be anticipated.</p>
<p>The sophisticated techniques of ‘big data’ mask the fact that the
attenuation of the ‘form’ remains the technological operating principle,
from filling in ‘user registration details’ for online services, student
evaluation questionnaires, to social research. The attenuation of
description to a few simple choices for the conveniences of monitoring,
measuring and organising has become a hallmark of modern technocracy.</p>
<p>The complex social effects of technological attenuation coupled with
artificially intelligent adaptation of forms are only beginning to be
discovered. There appear many negative side effects: ‘confirmation bias’
results in conversations occurring online between individuals with
equally distorted views being allowed to express them without any
challenge. ‘Trolling’ has emerged as a phenomenon whereby individuals
are targeted for abuse, and increasingly there is concern about ‘fake
news’ being used for political manipulation. Despite the ubiquity of the
‘form,’ there are many indications that the patterns of attenuation and
amplification serve the interests of technological corporations who
provide and manipulate interfaces at the expense of broader social
cohesion and political stability.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="electronic-heterarchy">
<h2>Electronic Heterarchy<a class="headerlink" href="#electronic-heterarchy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The internet was designed to provide many possible routes for messages
to be communicated across the network. This architecture, designed to
withstand a nuclear attack, was itself inspired by the architecture of
the brain, providing what Warren McCulloch called a “redundancy of
potential command,” or a ‘heterarchy.’</p>
<p>In a heterarchy, no single node has power over any other node in a
structure. However, this does not mean that collections of nodes may not
organise themselves to perform specific and distinct functions. The
human body is a heterarchy, but the cells of the body organise
themselves in specific functional units - whether in the brain, the
heart, the liver and so on. As our understanding of the dynamics of
communication in cells is beginning to tell us, at the core of
biological systems is the adaptability of cells to organise themselves
to the complexity or ambiguity of their environment
[&#64;torday_evolutionary_2012].</p>
<p>McCulloch developed his understanding of heterarchy through his study of
the brain, and through his attempt to establish similar structures in
electronic components - work that laid the foundations for neural
networks and machine learning. In McCulloch’s neural networks, no node
was more powerful than any other node. The interconnections between the
nodes meant that each node could perform a simple function in processing
input into output which together would articulate a logic. Today we use
this logic of neural networks for image recognition, machine translation
and automatic essay marking, among many other things. However,
McCulloch’s heterarchies also present an opportunity to understand the
deeper problems of hierarchy, the relationship of these problems to our
current implementation of technology, and what we might do about them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-organisation-of-education">
<h2>The Organisation of education<a class="headerlink" href="#the-organisation-of-education" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To study technology in education is to consider the ways communication
occurs in learning processes and how communication is coordinated. Given
the connection between lines of communication and organisational
structure, this means that the object of scrutiny in educational
technology is not software, hardware or pedagogy - it is the
<em>institution of education</em> as a whole organism.</p>
<p>Education’s hierarchical structure is facilitated and maintained through
the use of tools. Timetables, teachers, curricula, buildings,
assignments, exams, lunchbreaks, textbooks, pens and whiteboards are all
manifestations of educational organisation. So too are the political
processes by which a society agrees how it is to be paid for. These are
all things which we can point at when we talk of ‘education.’ Each
entity exists by virtue of custom and practice which has emerged over
history. Each is subject to declarations made by governments, community
leaders or institution heads at some point in time: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> is a classroom,
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y\)</span> is a textbook, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z\)</span> is a Learning Management System, and so on. With
a different set of declarations about the objects and processes of
education, education could be radically different from what we have. Yet
we struggle to imagine an alternative world - even when equipped with
new tools which could conceivably bring about better alternatives.</p>
<p>In producing new options for acting, computer technology provides the
means for overcoming existing constraints. Ironically, in doing so it
increases uncertainty within institutions. Since the institution needs
to defend its boundary by managing its relationship to its environment,
any increase in uncertainty within itself or its environment means that
the institution must act if it wishes to defend its structures. The
natural response of the institution is to use technology to do this.</p>
<p><em>Why</em> do the educational technologies we have today reinforce the
existing structures of the ancient institution? When technology affords
so many ways of reorganising education, <em>why</em> does the VLE reproduce the
structures of the classroom, timetable, curriculum and assessment? <em>Why</em>
does the MOOC amplify classrooms to a global scale? <em>Why</em> use video
simply to film lectures and not to transform the way teachers convey
their understanding? <em>Why</em> use text-based online forums as a substitute
for classroom discussion when technology affords much richer ways of
engaging people in activities together? <em>Why</em> use technology to ‘root
out’ plagiarism in assignments when the conditions which create the
temptation to plagiarise and engage in education thoughtlessly could be
transformed by technology? <em>Why</em> use Artificial Intelligence to automate
the teacher’s ability to make judgements about the quality of an essay?</p>
<p>The effect of shaping technological interventions in this way is to
attenuate the uncertainties produced by the multiple options presented
by technology. Existing structures and practices are the constraint
through which new possibilities are perceived. Beyond traditional
institutions, community movements, startups and individuals free from
traditional constraints will explore a more complete gamut of new
possibilities for reorganising things with technology. Innovative
business models like <em>Uber</em> or <em>AirBnB</em> do not arise within the confines
of institutions. But once they acquire a sufficient hold in the
environment, traditional institutions have to adapt and respond. Most of
the technological innovations which have become part of the everyday
institutional environment can trace their origins to these
counter-cultural innovations, of which Uber, Blockchain and AI are the
latest developments.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="control-and-coordination">
<h2>Control and Coordination<a class="headerlink" href="#control-and-coordination" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Today’s educational structures and practices were once solutions to the
human organisational problems of learning, inquiry and science. In a
society where uncertainty did not proliferate, where the church offered
ways in which individuals could address their existential concerns, and
where communication and learning were restricted by the technological
means of disseminating knowledge, educational institutions could
function with rigid hierarchical structures in a viable controlled
relationship with their social environment. This relationship has been
upset by technological developments: printing removed some of the
constraints of dissemination. It provided the conditions for a challenge
to church authority, and later through newspapers and pamphlets,
challenges to government and social organisation. Society has been
transformed by the internet in a way which has produced a massive
increase in complexity in the environment within which institutions
operate. This demands a re-examination of the ways in which the human
coordination of human beings and their learning might be approached.</p>
<p>In chapter 2 we introduced Beer’s definition of ‘control’ as the name
given to a relationship. Between the church and medieval society, there
was a relationship of control where the complexity of the environment
could be successfully managed with a hierarchical structure. Ashby’s Law
reframes the word ‘control’ in a more abstract way concerning the
relative complexity (or variety) of one system and another. The control
relationship may be conceived in the context of the relationship between
teachers and learners. The teacher’s variety is less than the collective
variety of the students. To maintain a controlled relationship,
attenuation of the students’ complexity is required (which we do through
rules, norms, expectations, positions and so on). Equally, the teacher
can exploit the position they find themselves in to <em>amplify</em> their
actions. Teachers will maintain control of the educational situation by
organising activities among groups of students, by broadcasting
different ways in which they understand their subject, by coordinating
conversation among the students where the students themselves produce
multiple descriptions of their own understanding. In essence, this
cybernetic approach is equivalent to the critical pedagogic approaches
of Paulo Freire’s ‘Pedagogy of the Oppressed’ [&#64;freire_pedagogy_1996]
where by addressing the constraints of an educational situation, those
constraints can be overcome and greater space can be created for more
effective self-organisation. It is worth noting that ‘brute force’
attenuation of the authoritarian teacher-bully, or the didactic
proponent of what Friere calls the ‘banking’ approach to education does
not result in a control relationship, even if it appears to produce
superficially acceptable results.</p>
<p>Control is about relationships. The situation which is under control is
the situation which is characterised by productive conversations and the
generation of multiple descriptions. Attempts to establish <em>control</em>
through increased attenuation of individual variety result in less
control, and create the conditions for greater chaos. The response to
increased chaos can make things even worse producing a positive feedback
loop. On recognising this, we can appreciate the ways in which the
attenuation of description often produced by technology, together with
the allergic response to uncertainty produces a situation where the
variety of learners and the variety of institutions is profoundly out of
balance. In other words, technology (or technocracy) produces the
conditions of oppression.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="technology-and-viable-education">
<h2>Technology and Viable Education<a class="headerlink" href="#technology-and-viable-education" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Technology has made both the institutional processes of education <em>and</em>
the environment within which education operates more complex. This
complexification of education has occurred despite the wish for the use
of technology to simplify education in various ways. For example,
Britain and Liber [&#64;britain_framework_1999]) argued that the Virtual
Learning Environment (VLE) could simplify the teacher’s coordination of
complexity in managing conversations in the classroom. They modelled the
VLE using Stafford Beer’s cybernetic <em>Viable System
Model</em>[&#64;beer_brain_1972] and Gordon Pask’s Conversation Theory
[&#64;pask_cybernetics_1975; &#64;laurillard_rethinking_2001]. The rationale for
the need to simplify educational coordination pointed to the increasing
global <em>demand</em> for education, the requirement for increased
institutional flexibility, greater personalisation of learning, and the
need for increased technological literacy. The role of existing
institutional hierarchies in determining student needs and requirements
and in shaping the rationale for increasing technological
complexification of education was, however, under-appreciated.</p>
<p>Britain and Liber’s underlying argument was that technology could change
the ways in which education could be organised by removing or
transforming the fundamental constraints of education. By enabling
teachers to manage the complexity of learners in new ways online, and
facilitating greater self-organisation among learners themselves, the
VLE obviated the need for co-location or synchronous participation of
learners as an organisational requirement for education. Conversation,
in particular, it was argued, could be coordinated online, and need not
be restricted to the classroom.</p>
<p>Liber and Britain’s approach meant getting beyond the basic
technological functions which reinforced the institution’s existing
provision. While most VLE systems performed the distribution of
resources adequately, VLEs became repositories of resources which could
be allocated across groups of students. The caricature of the VLE was
that it was a ‘giant photocopier,’ and with most of the available
systems, students could <em>not</em> organise each other, set up private
discussion groups, or install their own tools. The tools which they (and
their teachers) could use were the tools provided within the VLE
technological infrastructure. Whilst plug-in architectures were provided
to allow tool extensions to the basic toolkit, these had to be
administered centrally, and every new tool made available through the
VLE increased the headache of the computer service department
responsible for maintaining the technology. In effect, this meant that a
basic toolset was provided which tended to reproduce the practices of
the institution. There were virtual ‘classrooms,’ and there were
discussion forums. But not a lot else.</p>
<p>There were a number of experiments which sought to overcome these
difficulties. Often new innovations were introduced to overcome the
limitations of other innovations. For example, technological development
in education entailed the need to specify interoperability standards
between technical systems to avoid the problem of many incompatible
systems which reproduced each other’s functionality. Service-oriented
architecture (SOA) sought to establish lightweight information-exchange
relationships between different system components so as to remove
redundancy of functionality. Among the most radical innovations was a
peer-to-peer Virtual Learning Environment created by Liber, which could
be controlled by learners, and which afforded greater self-organisation
and control than server-centric systems. This system explicitly sought
to establish a heterarchical decentralised educational technology.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="personal-learning-and-technology">
<h2>Personal Learning and Technology<a class="headerlink" href="#personal-learning-and-technology" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Technological developments outside educational institutions in the first
decade of the 21^st^ century made it apparent that personal tools were
more powerful than the tools provided by the institution. Mobile phones,
social media and a plethora of online services for email, bookmarking,
blogging, and online video were superior to any institutional provision.
Such developments represented a challenge to institutions insofar that
many of the communications of students and staff began to occur in
contexts which were not within institutional control. While there were
(and continue to be) efforts to integrate the use of social media and
personal tools into the curriculum, institutions have sought to regulate
online communication behaviour with social media policies that are
designed to ensure that the institutional reputation can not be damaged
through public communications outside its control.</p>
<p>At the root of the difficulty in negotiating a stance towards social
media and personal technology is the increasing difficulty in being able
to draw a distinction between ‘learning something’ and ‘using tools.’
Both ‘learning’ and ‘using’ involve coordination - of resources, skills,
tools, relationships, time and space - and this coordination entails
sets of distinctions made within contexts which are recursively related.
For example, the individual’s challenge in a highly complex environment
might be that they negotiate engagement with formal education as well as
pursuing personal interests online, or dealing with issues of family or
finance. The challenge is to maintain cohesion in their identity and
manage their uncertainty. As they attempt this, they have to use a
variety of tools which provide access to different services for
different purposes. Every aspect of perception and each level of
uncertainty in this process affects other levels of recursion in the
identity of the individual. The institution’s insistence on the use of
its own technology rather than external services, or to demand
communications on external services conform to its social media policy
introduce further complexity in this coordination process.</p>
<p>Increasingly, new ways of technological coordination have been created
which consolidate cognate services through simple interfaces
(particularly through the smartphone). This consolidation of tooling was
advocated with the concept of a ‘Personal Learning Environment’ which
identified the learner’s problem as being fundamentally about cohesion
and coordination of action [&#64;johnson_personal_2008]. However, while
institutions have also sought to develop their own mobile ‘apps’ to
support learning, the learner’s coordination problem has, if anything,
become more complex, with an explosion of devices and software used for
specific functions ranging from e-portfolio competency management,
attendance monitoring or plagiarism detection.</p>
<p>Work on the Personal Learning Environment sought to identify the ‘whole
system’ of the ‘<em>person learning in a world of technology</em>.’ The
institutional response, by contrast, was not holistic. Instead,
institutions have responded to particular issues and threats presented
by the technology: for example, the need to control communications, or
capture data from students, or prevent plagiarism, or to guard the
intellectual property of learning content, or monitor engagement with
resources. Once again, institutional adoption of technology defends the
institution’s organisational structure. This raises the question as to
whether an alternative approach to the institutional adoption of
technology might be possible. How might a ‘whole system’ approach to the
institutional adoption of technology be conceived?</p>

<h2>The Topology of ‘Whole Systems’<a class="headerlink" href="#the-topology-of-whole-systems" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In order to address this question, deeper inspection of the nature of a
‘whole system’ is required. Persons and institutions are both ‘whole
systems’ which seek to maintain themselves in an uncertain environment.
Persons and institutions are also part of each other’s environment. The
personal and the institutional responses to uncertainty are connected,
but in each case, reactions which cause an increase in uncertainty
result from the reduction of these whole systems to particular parts. If
an individual is told that the solution to their uncertainty is to gain
a certificate, they can find that the uncertainties of dealing with the
institution are additional to the uncertainties that they experienced
before. Learning becomes merely part of a person’s identity, or the
granting of certificates becomes merely part of the institution’s
operation. Yet both persons and institutions make distinctions, and
these distinctions are the result of processes. How might the processes
which contribute to the distinctions of the individual and the
distinctions of the institution be coordinated better?</p>
<p>Cybernetics is concerned with the dynamics of whole systems. It sees
that whole systems have a structure, or a topology which is upheld
through processes of distinction-making (transduction). In chapter 1 we
identified that any boundary is accompanied by uncertainty about that
boundary, and this is a necessary feature of any distinction. In chapter
2, we suggested that conversation is necessary for the negotiation of
uncertainty among people. However, the intelligence which drives a
meaningful conversation, which gets to the heart of the matter, is
something which itself requires steering. In other words, whatever
‘whole’ a person or an institution might be, it has uncertainty, and
this uncertainty requires processes for coordinating activities which
mitigate it: there is a ‘whole,’ there is uncertainty, and there is
something outside the whole which coordinates the management of
uncertainty. It is these three components which constitute a whole.</p>
<p>The relationship between these dimensions is topological in the same way
as a form like a möbius strip has an ‘inside’ and an ‘outside’ which are
entwined. The distinctions in a whole system can also be seen to have an
‘inside’ and ‘outside’: on the inside is the ‘here and now’ of any
system, where it manages its processes to maintain its distinctions and
boundaries; beyond this ‘inside’ lies the <em>metasystem</em> which has to
manage the uncertainty produced on the inside with uncertainty in the
environment. It does this by attempting to steer the internal operations
by defining categories, but also by examining the environment within
which the system makes its distinctions because changes to the
environment may threaten the viability of the whole.</p>
<p>Systems fall apart when the internal and external operations work
against each other: where a metasystem imposes mechanisms on the system
which exacerbate uncertainty rather than help manage it. Technology can
contribute to greater coherence in the system, or it can produce
increased and unmanageable uncertainty and system collapse. The personal
system and the institutional system are connected in the fact that,
fundamentally, the optimal method of managing uncertainty is
conversation within the system. Therefore, the function of the
metasystem must be to create the optimal conditions for conversation
within the system so that the production of uncertainty that has to be
managed by the metasystem is minimised. How technology can do this, both
for the person and for the institution, is the subject of the next
section. However, a metasystem may use technology to enforce categories
of behaviour in the system, and as a result, it can reduce possibilities
for conversation and in so doing create a technocracy. If there is a
fundamental problem with technology in education, it is that the latter
case applies, rather than the former. To analyse this more carefully, we
have to dig further into the topology of the metasystem and its relation
to the whole.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="system-and-metasystem">
<h2>System and Metasystem<a class="headerlink" href="#system-and-metasystem" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The ‘wholeness’ of any system comprises numerous related processes. In
an organism, for example, there are processes to convert food into
energy, to deal with waste, to distribute oxygen, to coordinate movement
and to sense the environment. In an organisation like a university,
there are people teaching courses, dealing with accounts, administrating
student progress, producing marketing literature or managing the estate.
In any whole system there are differentiated functions which maintain
their distinctness and which require coordination, and many of these
functions must balance uncertainties both within themselves and within
the environment.</p>
<p>Understanding the environment is essential for the survival of any
organism - particularly in a fast-changing environment. The distinction
between the environment and the organism is a source of continual
uncertainty in two fundamental ways. On the one hand, there is
uncertainty about the internal operations of the organism itself - this
uncertainty is produced by the inconsistencies between the system’s
internal processes. On the other hand, there is uncertainty in the
environment in which the organism must survive - the criteria for
communication and coordination with the environment is continually
changing. The metasystem has the task of managing both dimensions of
uncertainty, and this entails the topology in the relationship between
system and metasystem, but also a structuring of the metasystem itself.</p>
<p>The metasystem’s topology must be able to manage internal uncertainty by
directing internal operations in such a way that they don’t exacerbate
it on the one hand, and on the other, by processing external uncertainty
in such a way that communications made by the system remain consistent
with changing circumstances. It is important that the balancing of the
processes of uncertainty management externally are coordinated with the
processes of balancing uncertainty internally. This balancing process
itself entails the need to create distinctions and determine operations
in a continual process of the organism’s existence in the environment.
There must therefore, be a third dimension to the structure which
maintains the balance between the external management of uncertainty and
the internal management of uncertainty.</p>
<p>To summarise, the metasystem of any whole system comprises three
processes: one focused on internal operations and their uncertainty; one
focused on the external environment; and one focused on balancing the
relationship between the other two.</p>
<p>If the metasystem’s job is to manage and balance internal and external
uncertainty, how might the metasystem and system work against each
other, and what role does technology play in this process? The essence
of the problem lies in the way that institutional hierarchy disrupts
both the internal operations of a system, and the relationship between
the system and its metasystem. The relationship between system and
metasystem necessarily involves the kind of attenuation which was
discussed at the beginning of this chapter. In order to manage internal
uncertainty, the metasystem must understand something of what is
producing that uncertainty and take actions to attempt to reduce it.
Technology affords a simple way of managing uncertainty: it helps to
ensure consistency and uniformity over the system’s operations, and it
attenuates the complexity of the system to be controlled through data
analysis. However, the attenuation of operations may mask deeper issues
which produce uncertainty, and as a result the imposition of technical
uniformity by the metasystem may exacerbate the uncertainty.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the metasystem’s engagement with the environment,
technology can provide a means of attenuating the environment to make it
tractable for the metasystem, and this attenuated version of the
environment can be coordinated with the internal processes of the
system. But if technology overrides important features of environmental
uncertainty, then the result will be increased incoherence.</p>
<p>Having said this, attenuation of a complex system by a system of less
complexity, such as between the environment and an organism, is
necessary. But a <em>viable</em> system has to be able to check if its
attenuations are correct, and have the flexibility to change them if
they are not. It is not what attenuation takes place, but what the
effects of those attenuations are when presented back to the system that
is controlled. In other words, the continued survival of a whole system
in an environment is dependent on the effective identification of error
in the model that the system has of itself. The critical ingredient for
effective organisation is that errors in attenuation are identified and
managed.</p>
<p>The problem with hierarchies in their deployment of technology is that
they lack sufficient capacity to check their own models of themselves.
Natural systems, by contrast, organise themselves heterarchically so
that whole systems are recursively organised, where individual
components exist in ecological relationships to one another, where
errors can be distributed throughout the system, and adaptations to
behaviour can be coordinated in a decentralised way.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="institutions-and-persons">
<h2>Institutions and Persons<a class="headerlink" href="#institutions-and-persons" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Persons are easier to understand as recursive whole systems than
institutions. Persons - learners, teachers, managers, etc - engage in a
conscious process of negotiating their behaviour in an environment.
Immediate “here and now” priorities demand specific actions, which often
entail the use of tools. Naturally, these “here and now” coordinations
produce some degree of uncertainty. In response, the personal metasystem
will seek, on the one hand, to act strategically and synergistically -
perhaps to “kill two birds with one stone.” On the other hand, the
personal metasystem will also ask questions like “where is this
leading?” “where do I want to go?” “how is the world changing and how
might I adapt?” Balancing the relationship between “here and now” and
deeper strategic issues are more fundamental questions like “who am I?”
or “What if I become like this?” Addressing these questions also entails
the use of tools: analytic tools, for example, can provide indicators of
how the world is changing, or internet searches may reveal new
opportunities, or personal organisers can help with synergy.</p>
<p>Many of the things which apply to the individual - needing to respond to
immediate priorities, needing to coordinate resources, needing to
consider changes in the environment, needing to adapt to changed
circumstances - also apply to institutions. However, the person is not a
hierarchy, whereas institutions of education are. Consequently, we end
up with institutions that:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>don’t have an understanding of the environment to which they have to
adapt.</p></li>
<li><p>attempt to organise “here and now” priorities with crude categories
which do not fit the real patterns of human coordination and
perception on the ground.</p></li>
<li><p>replace the reflexive operations of scanning the real environment
with the invention of “make-believe” environments (for example, a
‘market’ in higher education) which are declared to exist by those
at the top of organisations or in government, and to which strategic
operations are determined often on the ‘whim’ of senior figures.</p></li>
<li><p>collapse the function of speculating on the environment and strategy
with the processes of maintaining identity and managing operations.
This basically leads to a loss of richness in the models help by
managers of the thing managed.</p></li>
<li><p>uses technology to drive the attenuation of practice and uphold the
collapse of distinction-making function within institutions.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="recursive-transduction">
<h2>Recursive Transduction<a class="headerlink" href="#recursive-transduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>What has been described as a process of upholding sets of distinctions
has a more formal description in cybernetics developed by Stafford Beer.
In breaking-down the distinctions between the “inside and now” and the
“outside and then” of a system, Beer used the basic principles of
Ashby’s Law of requisite variety to diagnose the organisational problems
in institutions and to find ways of addressing them. Beer analysed the
topology of a whole, viable system, and produced an elaborated model
called the Viable System Model (VSM). The VSM was part of a life-long
quest for techniques to transform the ways in which human beings
organise themselves, and where social organisation could become more
like the heterarchical organisational structures of nature. He
understood that the fundamental problems of institutions concerned how
they made distinctions about themselves: the Viable System Model
presented a kind of template upon which institutions and businesses
could project their current operations and speculate on new ways of
organising themselves. At the heart of the work with the Viable System
Model was the fundamental question which is also the question of this
book: how do institutions and businesses manage their uncertainty? How
do they coordinate themselves with one another since each business is an
environment of every other? How do they create the conditions for
conversation? The problem apparent to Beer was that institutional
hierarchies manage their uncertainty by attenuating it, preferring to
exist in a ‘surrogate world’ constructed through their attenuations, and
disconnected from their actual environment.</p>
<p>To understand the maintenance of viability as a process, we have first
to understand how distinctions are made and maintained. The distinction
between an organism and its environment is maintained through a process
of attenuation of the environment by the organism, and the amplification
of organism’s attenuations through the production of multiple
descriptions of it. Any organism must somehow coordinate which parts of
its operations to attenuate the environment. This means that as part of
the organism there must be a higher-level function which examines the
function of the organism’s operations and attempts to coordinate them.
Thus, there are a series of attenuations and amplifications between the
organism and the environment which are shown in Figure
<a class="reference external" href="#ref:basictransduction">4.3</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”ref:basictransduction”}.</p>
<p><img alt="Coordination between environment (E) of Variety , organism (O) ofVariety  and organism metasystem (M) of Variety" src="_images/Varietymgmt1.jpg" />{#ref:basictransduction width=”\textwidth”}</p>
<p>Whilst the boundary between the different levels of attenuation and
amplification are drawn here as circles, clouds and boxes, it could
equally be drawn as a series of distinctions as barriers, where each
barrier performs an attenuation of information, an amplification of its
distinctions, and itself produces multiple descriptions of itself which
are then attenuated by a higher-level distinction as shown in Figure
<a class="reference external" href="#recursive">4.4</a>{reference-type=”ref” reference=”recursive”}.</p>
<p><img alt="Recursive transductions" src="_images/recursivevariety.jpg" />{#recursive
width=”\textwidth”}</p>
<p>Each level of transduction produces an attenuation of the level below
it. Each level of transduction presents multiple descriptions of itself
to the level above. The central issue here is that the attenuations are
by necessity always approximations. Each level engages directly with the
level below by presenting multiple descriptions of the attenuated
representation that it constructs. This process of producing multiple
descriptions of an attenuated representation might be thought of as
‘amplification.’ The result of the combined process of amplification and
attenuation is that there is <em>error</em> between the multiple descriptions
of the world as it is and the attenuated descriptions of it. The central
issue is what to do about the error.</p>
<p>Errors are manifested in the multiplicity of descriptions that each
level presents to the level above. These multiple descriptions are
similarly attenuated and amplified, and similarly produce error at the
next level. And so it goes on.</p>
<p><img alt="Multiple levels of recursive transduction within a connectedenvironment" src="_images/attenuate1.jpg" />{width=”\textwidth”}</p>
<p>However, the situation in all organisms and organisations is more
complex than a simple chain of distinctions - just as the attempt in
chapter 1 to identify the context of any distinction about education got
increasingly complex. At the most basic level, there is the need for
attenuation of information about the organism, and there is a need for
attenuation of information about the environment. So this could be drawn
like this:</p>
<p><img alt="Two dimensions of attenuation in the organisation: From bottom to top(vertical), and from the environment to the individual(horizontal)" src="_images/Slide2.jpg" />{width=”\textwidth”}</p>
<p>There are two key points which arise from this way of thinking. Firstly,
there exist approaches to organisation which avoid the problems of
hierarchy which we discussed earlier. Whilst attenuation is necessary
for any system to manage any other system of greater complexity than
itself, recursive distinction-making can create a dynamically adaptive
system whose operations in its environment are continually adapted
according to the difference between the attenuations and the actual
behaviour of the environment. Secondly, whilst recursion is the key to
effective adaptive behaviour and each level of transduction has the same
structure as every other, each level of recursion attenuates and
amplifies different differences. Because of this, recursive transduction
structures leads to what can be identified as differences in <em>function</em>
at different levels of recursion.</p>
<p>This second point is important when considering educational
institutions. The environment of teachers is different from the
environment of learners, or the environment of the institution’s
accountants, or its managers. Each functional unit makes different
attenuations and amplifications based on the information presented to it
by lower levels, and presents different information to high levels of
transduction.</p>
<p>From here it is possible to be clearer about the problems of
hierarchical organisation in education (or anywhere else). At all
levels, hierarchies reinforce functionally differentiated units which
attenuate the complexities of their environments, but hierarchies are
not organised to check the difference between the distinctions made at
each level and the reality each level exists in. The underlying reasons
for this lie in the way that <em>information</em> is understood and coordinated
in institutions. The news of the difference between the world as it is
imagined to be and as it actually is is the very essence of information.
Another way of putting this is to say, with Gregory Bateson, that
“Information is a difference that makes a difference.” What this means,
however, is that if the difference between the world as it is and the
world as it is perceived to be is not noticed, then there is no
information. The irony of modern educational institutions is that the
lack of news about difference in their perception is not only endemic,
but so-called ‘information technology’ has been used to remove
information from the system.</p>
<p>At this point, we can turn to how Stafford Beer sought to describe the
problems of recursive distinction-making and transduction, together with
the ways that information bringing news of error is carried through a
system in such a way that it continues to be adaptive.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="beer-s-viable-system-model">
<h2>Beer’s Viable System Model<a class="headerlink" href="#beer-s-viable-system-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Beer’s Viable System Model (VSM) describes multiple levels of
transduction in a whole system within an environment. The critical
feature of the VSM is that it is a recursive structure: whole systems
contain whole systems which contain whole systems. Moreover, each whole
system has the same topology: there is a system, and a metasystem which
must balance the uncertainty of the system, together with the
uncertainty of the environment.</p>
<p>The recursive structure of the VSM is immediately apparent from its
graphical presentation in Figure <a class="reference external" href="#ref:vsm">4.5</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”ref:vsm”}, but what is not so apparent is why this recursive
structure provides the necessary capacity to distribute error throughout
the system, and to adapt to a changing environment.</p>
<p>In the VSM, five ‘regulating mechanisms’ are specified whose job is to
maintain the viability of the whole system. Following Ashby, Beer
explains that “the regulator has to be capable of generating a variety
equivalent to the variety that has to be regulated - or the regulator
will fail” [&#64;beer_heart_1995]. If the variety of the environment
overwhelms the system, then the system is at risk of collapse through
unmanageable oscillation (competing for resources) amongst the system’s
components. The viable system must attenuate the variety of the
environment and amplify its own operations in order to ensure viable
operation. Figure <a class="reference external" href="#ref:vsm">4.5</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”ref:vsm”} shows these regulating mechanisms:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>‘system 1’ represents the “here and now” operations of the system
(the big circle on the right hand side), and each of these
operations themselves has the same recursive structure as the whole;</p></li>
<li><p>‘system 2’ concerns is a mechanism for coordinating system 1
operations to ensure that there are no conflicts between the system
1 components (Beer calls this ‘anti-oscillation’);</p></li>
<li><p>‘system 3’ is the first level of the meta-system which manages the
uncertainty in the system by ensuring the adequate provisioning of
resources, and the synergistic coordination of activity;</p></li>
<li><p>‘system 3*’ feeds information about the performance of the system
to system 3;</p></li>
<li><p>‘system 4’ is an anticipatory system, containing a model of itself,
which it considers in relation to what it understands about the
world outside, making recommendations for adaptation;</p></li>
<li><p>‘system 5’ has to balance the relationship between system 4 and
system 3.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Multiple levels of recursive transduction in Beer's Viable SystemModel" src="_images/VSM.jpg" />{#ref:vsm width=”\textwidth”}</p>
<p>So here is the topology of the ‘whole’ as was articulated in section
4.9, coupled with the idea of recursive transduction as the process
which maintains the distinctions between the different components of the
system. High levels of functional differentiation (i.e. different system
1 activities) and recursion mean that errors produced through the
attenuations and amplifications of each component are fed through to the
next level of recursion above. Distributed and recursive attenuation and
amplification provides requisite capacity (or requisite variety) to
adapt the whole system to respond to environmental uncertainty on the
one hand, whilst having requisite variety to absorb internal
uncertainty.</p>
<p>In educational institutions (like all institutions), the basic
transduction process is conversation, although other levels of
transduction including biology, technology and psychology are also
implicated. This means that the distributed and recursive structure
represents an ‘ecology’ of conversational relations within the whole
institution: there are conversations between and among students,
teachers, managers, and so on, and each of these conversations are means
of managing individual uncertainty - or the uncertainty management of
‘whole persons.’ As the uncertainty of the environment increases, so
deeper levels of recursion and distribution of conversation need to be
coordinated in order to manage it. At a practical level, this means
greater transdisciplinarity, the removal of artificial barriers of
status or job function, and the facilitation of the emergence of new
categories of understanding.</p>
<p>All of these things can be facilitated and synergised with technology.
Technology makes new possibilities available for the making of
descriptions about the world. Since knowledge and understanding may be
expressed via text, video, skype, face-to-face, in a book, in a podcast,
and so on, each method creates new possibilities for the ways in which
intersubjective connections might be made. However, because this
technology increases options for acting, and hence increases
uncertainty, a hierarchical institution will seek to contain it in some
way, to defend itself against rising uncertainty. As a consequence of
this, hierarchy <em>reduces</em> the levels of recursion in the institution and
reinforces the boundaries between disciplines and status, replacing a
recursive and conversational process for understanding the environment
with a technological attenuation of the environment driven by ‘learning
analytics’ or artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Only a shift in understanding the transduction processes of hierarchy
can remedy this. The requisite variety necessary for institutional
adaptation and survival depends on recursive distribution of
transductions (as indeed is the case in natural organisation). At any
transduction boundary, multiple descriptions of the same thing are
attenuated into a ‘concept’ which attempts to summarise them all, while
the system’s resulting understanding of itself generates possibilities
for action in the environment. The boundary is produced <em>between</em> the
attenuation of many descriptions, and the proliferation of descriptions
on the other side of the boundary. Since each transduction process is
another transduction processes’s environment, removing layers of
recursion means harsher attenuation and a false model of the world:
eventually, the metasystem ‘believes’ it is the system to be managed.</p>
<p>In the VSM, the difference between System 1 and its environment, or
between System 2 and System 3 is a difference in the kind of
descriptions made and the transduction processes which result. System 2
makes descriptions of System 1, System 3 makes descriptions of System 2
and System 1, and so on. Without differences in the descriptions which
these different components make, there is no grounds for making a
distinction between the different systems. In Beer’s own consultancy
practice with businesses, he sought to identify and distinguish the
different descriptions which related to the different regulating systems
as a way of defining and maintaining the recursive structure of the
organisation.</p>
<p>The problem of hierarchy is often portrayed as a problem of ‘power,’ but
the VSM shows this to be a mistake. The problem of hierarchy is a
problem of adaptability and control, and this problem has been made
worse by the hierarchical adoption of technology. ‘Power’ in this sense,
is an invention which serves the creation of a hierarchical structure.
The viable system maintains its recursive structure of transduction
processes and distribute error handling to maintain coherence in a
changing environment. Somehow, nature is able to ‘compute’ its
uncertainty and adapt itself in way which is different from the way that
humans and their technologies currently do. Educational institutions and
their technology are important because they sit at the crossroads
between this ‘natural’ computation which is inherent in conversation and
our search for knowledge, and the technocratic approach to hierarchy
which typifies all institutions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="measuring-institutional-health">
<h2>Measuring Institutional Health<a class="headerlink" href="#measuring-institutional-health" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This chapter has approached the problem of institutional organisation
both from a topological perspective which argues that whole systems
contain uncertainty which necessitates a metasystem, and from a
‘process’ perspective, where the distinctions between the different
components of a whole system are maintained through recursive
transduction. Beer’s VSM provides a way of bringing these two
perspectives together. Powerful though it is, there are some problems
which it does not address. For example, as with all cybernetic
approaches, it assumes that the coherence of a whole system can arise
from the kind of stochastic process witnessed in Ashby’s homeostat (and
this may not be true). It also assumes that the complexity of a whole
system is ‘countable’: i.e. the <em>variety</em> of the system is consistently
measurable over a period of time (what statisticians call ‘ergodicity’).
Yet human systems like institutions are emergent, and produce their own
constraints on themselves and their own countable categories. They are
non-ergodic.</p>
<p>This second problem also applies to problems of hierarchical
organisation, where most institutions now coordinate their operations
according to the setting and meeting of targets. These target are also
an attempt to treat the non-ergodic system as an ergodic system. Failure
to meet targets, whether it is in student satisfaction surveys,
retention, lack of research, falls in income and so forth all result in
political processes whereby those at the top of the hierarchy will seek
to blame those elsewhere in the hierarchy for the failure. Individuals
are moved, priorities are shifted, but nothing else changes. Targets
themselves are the result of somebody else’s distinctions about what the
environment is, and how institutions should adapt to it. These
distinctions are only reinspected when the consequences of attempting to
meet one set of targets has been shown to fail, and a new set of targets
is produced which is equally unfounded.</p>
<p>Although Beer’s VSM carries the assumption of the countability of
complexity, its emphasis on recursion can help deal with the problem of
targets and the coordination of effective organisation. What is
noticeable about target-setting and the determination of strategy in
most institutions is the absence of explicit worked-out theory. Any
target is a distinction whose underlying distinctions are not available
for inspection. Management appears to govern according to whims. The
deep problem with this (apart from it not working) is that when things
don’t work, nothing is learnt because the foundation for the rationale
for the strategy or target cannot be teased apart.</p>
<p>Theorising strategic change within the institution is a way of exposing
the different levels of transduction process which constitute
distinctions relating to a target. In other words, it makes explicit the
layers of recursion in the institution’s model of itself in the world.
Inevitably, this model will be wrong. But it won’t all be wrong, and the
institution’s metasystem can direct and evolve those aspects of its
behaviour to accommodate what it believes to be true and change what it
discovers to be false. This process also potentially deepens
conversations across the whole institution.</p>
<p>Institutions are the composite of many distinctions and descriptions
made by many brains. The uncertainty arising from differences in
distinctions between different people can either be negotiated through
conversation or suppressed through the assertions of a hierarchy. The
health of the institution as a measure of its adaptability is a measure
of the richness of its levels of recursion, the subtlety of its
theoretical discussion about its own operations, and most basically, the
richness of the variety of conversation which it fosters.</p>
<p>The health of an education institution can also be measured by observing
the actions of its metasystem. The pathology of many institutions
results in the management believing it <em>is</em> the university: the
metasystem believes it is somehow separable from the system it manages.
The more this manifests itself, the more chaotic the metasystem’s
operations will become as it seeks to directly command the operations of
the system, which in response to the oppression inflicted on it and
worsening conditions of work, will show signs of collapse in the mental
wellbeing of its staff and students.</p>

<p>Part 2 begins by introducing a diagrammatic approach to analysing
uncertainty in institutions, science and technology derived from the
later work of Stafford Beer. Scientific uncertainty, ushered-in with the
discoveries of Einstein, Bohr, Heisenberg and others developed
hand-in-hand with the computer technology that made the statistical
calculations of probability efficient and upon which the new science
depended. Given that universities largely retain the form of
institutions of a more objective enlightenment science, Chapter 5 shows
how this diagrammatic technique can help in conceiving of an institution
of an ‘uncertain science’: how should society organise its pursuit of
knowledge and learning?</p>
<p>In doing this, it considers the problems which face us arising from what
I argue is the university’s current ‘incomplete transformation.’
Technology is at the heart of the new science: the calculations of
physicists predicting the behaviour of subatomic particles rely on the
manipulation of probabilities in complex equations. Technologies of
Artificial Intelligence also manipulate probabilities, and the
transformation of the world brought about through these technologies has
to be understood within education.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 considers that one of central issues in an ‘uncertain’ science
is how knowledge and uncertainty is communicated. It is argued that
openness of education and knowledge is a scientific necessity, not
merely an institutionally-oriented attempt to provide ‘access’ to
education. Despite this, education has maintained closed practices: what
is termed ‘upholding the scarcity of knowledge.’ It is argued that
communicating uncertainty entails a new level of democratic engagement
in science. Just as printing and the Royal Society democratised
enlightenment science in the 17^th^ century, so in order to communicate
uncertainty, a new degree of openness is required in educational
communication - both in teaching and in research. How can scientific
communication of uncertainty can take place which is open to the
expression of uncertainty by the whole of society?</p>
<p>Chapter 7 returns to the problem of institutional organisation and
considers the way in which technology is currently used and the ways in
which it might be used in the future. The analysis focuses on the
concept of ‘trusted transactions’: I argue that an open, uncertain
science requires new decentralised ways of organising communication.
Decentralisation, however, removes one of the fundamental attributes of
institutional authority in coordinating science: that institutional
judgements, whether about new discoveries or degree certificates, are
<em>trusted</em>. However, new technologies like Blockchain suggest that trust
can be established without centralised brokers. Can the deployment of
decentralised technology deliver an open transformation in science and
education? Can this help society to manage its uncertainty better? What
might it mean for the institution of higher learning?</p>

<h2>Prelude: Drawing Uncertainty<a class="headerlink" href="#prelude-drawing-uncertainty" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A discussion about the coordination of science and uncertainty requires
clarity about uncertainty. So far, I have concentrated on uncertainty
produced by the explosion of options for acting that technology has
given us. That uncertainty is a problem of choice, and is closely
related to Shannon’s information theory. Science in the 20^th^ century
has produced another kind of uncertainty, transforming the ‘objective’
science of the enlightenment into a probabilistic investigation of
nature for which the computer has become an indispensable tool. Both
kinds of uncertainty have implications for education. On the one hand,
education has to manage technologies so as to defend its institutional
structures from technological uncertainty. On the other, the institution
as an ‘institution of science,’ must invest in new technologies for
processing the uncertainties arising from almost all branches of
scientific inquiry.</p>
<p>If the ‘institution of science’ is seen as a ‘whole system,’ then
following the arguments of the previous chapter, this system contains
uncertainties or what Beer calls ‘undecidable propositions.’ These
uncertainties must be managed by a metasystem that sits outside the
system. Since science as well as technology is the source of this
uncertainty, an ‘institution of science’ must adapt its organisational
structures, its empirical practices, its method of communicating its
discoveries, and its criteria for admitting valid contributions to its
discourse. In other words, if technology doesn’t cause institutions to
change their practices with regard to uncertainty, then science will.</p>
<p>In his book ‘Platform for Change,’ Stafford Beer presented a set of
‘theses’ as diagrams which illustrated the state of institutions with
regard to ever-increasing uncertainty, and the transition to what he
considered to be viable heterarchical institutional structures
[&#64;beer_platform_1995]. These diagrams emphasise the relationship between
the system and the metasystem, identifying explicitly the metasystem’s
management of the uncertainty of the system. In this relationship,
‘categories’ are invented by the metasystem to help absorb undecidable
questions. Importantly, these categories are used as ways of
coordinating with the external environment, in the interaction with
other external systems, and in the coordination of internal uncertainty.
Technology can be enlisted as a means of maintaining coherence and
reinforcing categories, although it produces what Beer calls ‘explosive
complexification’ (see Figure
<a class="reference external" href="#ref:beeruncertain">5.1</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”ref:beeruncertain”})</p>
<p>Drawn in this way, the essence of hierarchical structure is seen as the
imposition of categories of understanding on the internal processes of
the institution, and the ever-increasing uncertainty in the environment
generated by other institutions with similarly unstable hierarchies. In
resolving this, Beer argues an appropriate balance has to be found
between the management of internal uncertainties and the coordination
with uncertainties in the environment, and this entails the kind of
heterarchical and recursive restructuring of systems that was discussed
in the previous chapter.</p>
<p>In a simple diagrammatic way, Beer draws the system, its uncertainty,
the metasystem in its relation to this uncertainty, and the relationship
of the metasystem’s categories with other systems. Essentially, what is
articulated is a ‘double tranduction’ process, somewhat analogous to
what has been found to operate in cellular communication
[&#64;hoffmeyer_biosemiotics:_2009]:</p>
<p><img alt="A diagram of the relationship between inner uncertainty and externaluncertainty (derived from Beer's &quot;Platform forChange&quot;)" src="_images/Uncertaintybeer.jpg" />{#ref:beeruncertain width=”\textwidth”}</p>
<p>The value of this way of drawing uncertainty is that it makes it clear
that the institution’s viability is dependent on the relationship of the
metasystemic categories within their external environment of other
institutions is coupled with the effectiveness of these categories in
managing internal uncertainty. Seen in this way, it is potentially
possible that an institution may have highly deficient categories of
understanding itself, and so be ineffective in managing its uncertainty,
but effective in reinforcing categories of understanding produced by
other social entities in the environment. Such is the case with
scientific categories of understanding which can dominate education for
centuries, requiring an eventual ‘paradigm shift’ to change
[&#64;kuhn_structure_1996]. It also helps to show how the enlightenment
institution of science was able to flourish with a relatively simply
hierarchical structures because the uncertainties of scientific
observation were manageable through the diligent application of method,
the generation of empirical regularities and the conversational
construction of theory.</p>
<p>Paradigm shifts can change scientific discourse without necessarily
changing the structures and practices of the institutions of science and
education immediately. It took 100 years, for example, from the
publication of Bacon’s ‘The Advancement of Learning’ which castigated
the Aristotelian scientific curriculum at Cambridge in 1605, before the
institutional practice of science and education had been transformed
into the empirical model that we know today. The scientific discoveries
of Einstein and Bohr have similarly disrupted enlightenment scientific
certainty in such a way that technology became necessary to perform
probabilistic calculations on empirical outcomes, but the uncertainties
inherent in almost all modern scientific inquiry have not been reflected
in the ways that science is communicated, or in the ways that it is
taught. Yet we now have a science where both the technologies of
calculation and the underlying physical theories have contributed to an
explosion of uncertainty.</p>
<p>The institution of science, the university, has embraced the theories of
uncertain science, but has retained the practices of enlightenment
science. Moreover, it has set technology not only to support its
empirical practices but enlisted it to reinforce an unreconstructed
model of education, still rooted in the 17^th^ century.</p>

<h2>Technology and the Institution of Science<a class="headerlink" href="#technology-and-the-institution-of-science" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In a scientific world of multiple theories and uncertainty, the computer
has become the principal scientific instrument with which this
multiplicity has been managed. The history of the new physics and
computer science are entwined: by the 1940s - not long after the
theoretical discoveries - computers were being used to calculate the
solutions to the statistical equations of Boltzmann and Gibbs. This
ushered in a new world where theoretical development could be
accelerated with mechanical aids to computation.</p>
<p>In the years to the present day, the computer has transformed science to
the point of dominating it. The sophistication of statistical analysis
which rested on the work of Boltzmann (and in turn Shannon, who adapted
Boltzmann’s work into a theory of information), has been exploited in
crunching ever-vaster amounts of data (such as the human genome)
producing new patterns and descriptions which reveal new insights.
Computer-generated models appear to imitate nature displaying predictive
power in their behaviour without any underlying hypothesis, and results
of search routines upon the vast database of resources on the web can
easily create the impression that the world <em>is</em> the internet.</p>
<p>This has led to an instrumentalisation of scientific inquiry. Advances
in machine learning, off-the-shelf software for crunching social science
data, modelling tools from engineering to biology create a scientific
environment where inability to control the available software is a
greater hindrance to professional success than the inability to think
critically about what is being experienced. In a recent article, Amos
argues that the computer-dominated ‘big science’ is something we should
all worry about because:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>genome sequencing offers little science training because most of the
work is done by machines and technicians … it is the antithesis of
good science, being largely hypothesis-free and involving little
experimental design. Why are we placing our few remaining publicly
funded eggs into proportionately fewer and fewer baskets?
[&#64;amos_big_2013]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Behind Amos’s critique is a worry about the use of the computer as a
substitute for brains. The utopian visions for the future of science
envisage the ever-increasing power of machine learning and ‘Big Data’
producing answers to fundamental scientific and societal problems -
including those of education. Does this mechanisation risk the exclusion
of the kind of intellectual thought which can bring about new ways of
looking at the world which characterise the discoveries of Einstein and
Bohr who brought about this current scientific revolution in the first
place?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="technology-modelling-and-speculative-inquiry">
<h2>Technology, Modelling and Speculative Inquiry<a class="headerlink" href="#technology-modelling-and-speculative-inquiry" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The characteristic of scientific thought which overturns prevailing
paradigms is speculation or ‘abuduction.’ In recent years, the
computer’s role in speculation has taken the form of modelling of
various kinds, including techniques like ‘agent-based modelling’ or
‘equation-based modelling’
[&#64;axelrod_evolution_1990; &#64;gilbert_agent-based_2007]. Here, comparisons
can be made between the operation of the computer models and reality, in
the process identifying ways in which the speculation might be refined,
or abandoned and a different model tried. However, such modelling
techniques have tended to reinforce existing disciplinary boundaries,
making deeper speculation at the boundaries of disciplines more
difficult.</p>
<p>The irony of this is that cybernetic ideas sit behind ideas like
agent-based modelling. Cybernetic thinking was slowly absorbed into the
disciplinary structure of the academy and this meant that major advances
were made in numerous fields. It also meant that the institutions of
science were unchanged by deeper cybernetic epistemology about ‘whole
systems’ and institutional structures were left intact. The cybernetic
influence of different disciplines allowed those disciplines to put up
new barriers which reinforced their disciplinary separateness from one
another, bypassing the essential cybernetic approach sought to break
down barriers. For example, cognitive science quickly absorbed
cybernetic ideas of feedback, but then adopted a positivist stance with
regard to the position of the ‘observer’ of cognitive phenomena, since
this would have been to admit some vulnerability in its claim for
scientific objectivity [&#64;neisser_cognition_1976], or would have entailed
acknowledgement of sociology within its disciplinary framework. In
economics, Von Neumann’s ‘game theory’ and Weiner’s time series analysis
quickly became econometric tools which became divorced from deeper
questions about human action and rationality.</p>
<p>Alongside the development of the computer for statistical calculations
in science, the computer presented ways in which different forms of
logical organisation could be explored. From the early days of
cybernetics, simple machines like Ashby’s homeostat illustrated new ways
in which mechanical automata could produce life-like phenomena. This
behaviour of inter-connected systems led to the deeper exploration how
the computer could organise and process data in ways which were inspired
by biological systems. The building of computational models of natural
systems, and more specifically the exploration of the organisation of
the brain were dominant aspects of this work. In the 1950s and 60s,
cybernetics was the emerging discipline within which these developments
could be considered together. University departments fostered
exploration in the application of algorithmic thinking to biology (Heinz
von Foerster’s Biological Computer Lab, where he recruited Ross Ashby,
psychology and human learning (Gordon Pask’s research at Brunel
University), ecology (Howard and Eugene Odum’s work at the University of
Georgia), Management (Stafford Beer, Enid Mumford, and others at
Manchester Business School), the brain and neural networks (McCulloch at
MIT), psychotherapy (Bateson) and Technology and computer science (Von
Neumann at Princeton).</p>
<p>This early period in cybernetics was a time of highly speculative
transdisciplinary inquiry. Cybernetics was the science of organisation
and used insights gained from observing the behaviour of the new
computers to inform understanding about the natural world, which in turn
influenced the development of the technology.</p>
<p>What we now call ‘machine learning’ also belongs to this period. Machine
learning has its roots in the work of one of the pioneers of early
cybernetics, Warren McCulloch. McCulloch saw that the neural structures
of the brain were multiple interconnected transductions. In describing
the logic of this structure, McCulloch coined the term ‘heterarchy’
(Chapter 4). McCulloch’s neural network represents a <em>logical</em>
description of the mechanism whereby reinforcement and adaptation of the
network could lead to apparently intelligent behaviour. So, for example,
by presenting a neural network with many examples of a phenomenon, it
can configure its network to process the features of that phenomenon for
future recognition. Today’s ‘convolutional’ neural networks recognise an
image to be a rabbit as a result of the many interconnected nodes on
their network having been trained to identify the different dimensions
of rabbit-like pictures through repetitive ‘training.’ Many thousands of
images of rabbits are necessary to produce this effect, where each image
is processed through sequences of ‘layers’ which examine different
levels of magnification of the image. Fundamentally, however,
McCulloch’s basic heterarchical idea still applies.</p>
<p>McCulloch’s interest in neural nets was not so much in immitating a
brain, as in exploring the logical properties of what he saw to be an
unusual mechanism. These properties appeared to defy one of the key
principles of classical logic: the ‘law of the excluded middle’ whereby
something can either be true or false, but never both. For McCulloch,
the heterarchical neural networks would process information in the form
that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A &gt; B\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B &gt; C\)</span>, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C &gt; A\)</span>. If brains are like this, what are we
to make of our logical reasoning about them? The physicists however,
were also taking an interest in these questions too, since it was
becoming apparent that the law of the excluded middle didn’t apply to
quantum mechanics either.</p>
<p>McCulloch was engaged in a process of creative guesswork as to what
<em>might be happening</em> in the brain guided by what was currently known
about neural architecture. With a formal description like this, a model
(or a machine) could be constructed and its properties explored. Among
the many properties of the machine, some aspects of behaviour would
correspond to real biological phenomena. What could be learnt from such
a machine however, would depend on where its behaviour <em>differed</em> from
the natural world. Today, neuroscience would question most of McCulloch
and Pitts’s assumptions, not least, the last assumption that “the
structure does not change”[&#64;dennett_consciousness_1993]. McCulloch
presented a model, the purpose of which was to generate possibilities
which may or may not be found in nature. Like all cyberneticians,
McCulloch was interested in discovering the constraints of nature which
led to results that deviated from his predictions.</p>
<p>Through a combination of social and technical constraints, computer
models, including McCulloch’s neural nets, have become <em>surrogates</em> for
reality, where inquiry focusses less on the generative power of the
model and its divergence with nature, and more on how the generative
power of the computer eliminates the need for critical human judgement.
The technology is used to ‘optimise’ laboratories so as to create the
best conditions where the machine can produce its results. With the
consequent threat to human intellectual and scientific labour comes a
threat to the conversations that give life to new ideas in the academy -
conversations about hypotheses, doubts about results, new approaches to
research, social implications and transdisciplinary connections. Most
fundamentally, what the computer cannot do is communicate its
uncertainty about what it is doing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-has-the-computer-done-to-science">
<h2>What has the computer done to science?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-has-the-computer-done-to-science" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is tempting to blame the computer for the increasing automation of
science. The value of the ‘uncertainty lens’ is that this can be seen to
be incorrect. Uncertainty creates the conditions where institutional
hierarchies seek rationalisation of their operations and cost-savings.
It is the organisation of educational institutions in a world of
technologically-generated uncertainty which is the problem, not
technology itself. However, to say that “technology creates uncertainty
by increasing options for acting” now needs further elaboration.</p>
<p>Clearly the computer that visualises the connections between neurons in
the brain, or stars in the solar system, or projects trends from social
network analysis is doing more than simply creating new options for
acting. Equally the computer that presents users with forms to fill in
in order to apply for research grants, or computers that control the
flow of documents from one department to another, are doing more than
creating new options - although new options for <em>somebody</em> are always
created in each of these examples. More specifically, we say that the
computer provides facilities for amplification and attenuation:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Amplification</strong>: The computer is able to generate new forms of
representation of reality based on algorithmic manipulation of data
collected about the world, and guesswork encoded as algorithms about
how the world might look according to different parameters.
Automatically generated representations of reality are alternative
descriptions, and the human intellect and human conversation may use
these new descriptions to gain deeper scientific insight into
nature.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Attenuation</strong>: The computer collects data in ways that make it
amenable to analysis and the production of new representations of
reality. This entails attenuation in the form of interfaces which
restrict input to particular kinds of data, sensors which are tuned
to detect certain kinds of signal, or security constraints which
prevent access by unauthorised people.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In considering what the computer has done to science, the three
dimensions of increasing options for acting (increasing uncertainty),
amplification and attenuation should be seen together.</p>
<p>From Beer’s diagram (Figure
<a class="reference external" href="#ref:beeruncertain">5.1</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”ref:beeruncertain”}), the sources of uncertainty are both
technology and scientific knowledge. As the environmental complexities
of an uncertain science are felt, then technologies are employed to help
institutions manage this. However, the deeper cause of the inability to
manage the uncertainty of science is the internal organisation of the
institution. Therefore the fundamental question is, What does an
institution of science look like in the 21^st^ century?</p>
<p>It is not simply that the hierarchies of the ancient institution need to
be transformed into heterarchies. It is that something needs to happen
in the communicative environment of science in order that internal
uncertainty can be balanced with external uncertainty. This
communicative environment is one which belongs to the whole of society:
it is, for example, the whole of communications technology which forms
the external environment. So how can scientific inquiry evolve so that
it contributes to a constructive way of dealing with uncertainty in the
environment?</p>
<p>The institutions of science have long been the arbiters of
trustworthiness of scientific fact. Quite often they get it wrong,
reject theories which turn out to be right, ostracise scientists they
disagree with - only to celebrate them as alumni when those scientists
(now long dead) have been discovered as heroes and heroines of progress!
The manifest unsoundness of official approval or disapproval for new
theory has attracted theories of its own. The theories of Kuhn
[&#64;kuhn_structure_1996], Popper [&#64;popper_conjectures_2002],
Lakatos[&#64;lakatos_criticism_2008] or Feyerabend
[&#64;feyerabend_against_2010] are all ways of trying to account for the
peculiar behaviour of the institution of science. All of these positions
have strengths and weaknesses which have been written about copiously.
All of them articulate some kind of meta-scientific causal narrative
behind the business of discovering (or disproving) causes. None of them</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>not even Feyerabend - consider science at the interface between
institutional structures and practices and environmental uncertainty.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In a society which generates increasing uncertainty, education becomes
part of society’s attenuative apparatus, and this attenuative function
is aided by the ways in which education has deployed technology. The
university is the place where society asks questions about itself, its
institutions and its technology. New ways of harnessing the
uncertainties of quantum mechanics, or protein interactions, or DNA, or
art require new conversations and new forms of scientific communication.
Education’s incomplete transformation in response to the 20^th^
century’s scientific revolution amounts to the failure to transform its
organisational structures to create the conditions for the communication
of uncertainty.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="homo-faber">
<h2>Homo Faber<a class="headerlink" href="#homo-faber" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Technology has the capacity not only to pretend that uncertainty isn’t
there, but it also can inspire continual iterations of making new
technologies, where at each stage, the deficiencies of the previous
stage are attenuated-out by the latest innovation. The drive for human
invention and innovation is often lauded as a virtue - especially since
patent applications are considered tangible marks of a university’s
success. However, what does not happen in the drive for innovation is
implementation of the internal recursive processes which can give the
institution sufficient flexibility to adapt if environmental conditions
turn unfavourable. Moreover, if the institution’s metasystem decides
that it too can ‘innovate’ in the same manner, then the stakes become
increasingly high, and the sacrifices for managerial innovation involve
removing the capacity the institution has for critique of itself.</p>
<p>Stafford Beer regarded the ‘innovation problem’ as a manifestation of
what he calls <em>Homo Faber</em>. He explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Today, man sees himself still as <em>homo faber</em>, the industrialist, the
creature who invented work. And the things he makes are still largely
about the control of the environment. We still stitch clothes to keep
us warm, and build houses to keep out the elements. We have invented a
vast range of manufactures in an attempt to control the natural
environment of distance - from the bicycle to the interplanetary space
vehicle. Whereas the hostile environment used to be mastered by
flint-tipped arrows, we try to master it today with plutonium-tipped
rockets. [&#64;beer_platform_1995]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The alternative to Homo Faber, Beer suggests, is Homo Gubernator - the
<em>steersperson</em>. Steering, he argues, is not the same as innovating or
making. Steering entails the full engagement of the human intellect for
the making of good decisions and effective control of the institution in
its social environment. This is not to say that steering does not
involve technology or innovation, but it is to emphasise that the point
of innovating is to enrich the internal processes whereby uncertainty is
distributed and managed. Misplaced faith in the purpose of technology
has social consequences. Ivan Illich, a friend of Beer who shared
similar concerns, observed a critical problem in the pattern of
technological evolution:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>At first, new knowledge is applied to the solution of a clearly stated
problem and scientific measuring sticks are applied to account for the
new efficiency. But at a second point, the progress demonstrated in a
previous achievement is used as a rationale for the exploitation of
society as a whole in the service of a value which is determined and
constantly revised by an element of society, by one of its
self-certifying professional élites.[&#64;illich_tools_2001]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>On one level, incremental improvement of technology works: today’s cars
are far better than the cars of the 1950s, aircraft rarely crash, and
medical procedures which would have once been highly dangerous are now
routine and safe. Technology evolves: it becomes more efficient, safer
and cheaper. However, success in the development of cars, planes, space
rockets and surgery have not been matched by developments in equity,
freedom, social welfare, education and the prevention of conflict.
Illich highlights the connection between the apparent success of
technical development and improvement and the consequent cost in society
and its environment.</p>
<p>The technological gain of increased efficiency produces systematic
problems elsewhere: the ubiquity of the car and the safety of the plane
turns the ground to tarmac, pollutes the air with fumes and noise,
causes congestion, results in the travelling of increasing distances and
creates a pathological obsession with speed. C.S. Lewis is equally
critical, but highlight the fact that these processes create
intergenerational inequality:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Each generation exercises power over its successors: and each, in so
far as it modifies the environment bequeathed to it and rebels against
tradition, resists and limits the power of its predecessors. This
modifies the picture which is sometimes painted of a progressive
emancipation from tradition and a progressive control of natural
processes resulting in a continual increase of human power. In
reality, of course, if any one age really attains, by eugenics and
scientific education, the power to make its descendants what it
pleases, all men who live after it are the patients of that power.
They are weaker, not stronger: for though we may have put wonderful
machines in their hands we have pre-ordained how they are to use them.
[&#64;lewis_abolition_2013 57]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In the process of innovation, inventors, technologists and business
people work in communities, and these communities are organised, usually
in hierarchical ways. Within each member of an innovation community is
an individual ‘metasystem’ - some organising principle steering the
individual’s mission in participating in their work. The metasystem sees
to it that the concerns of Illich, Beer and Lewis are factored-out in
the mission to produce the next generation of car or medicine. However,
the uncertainty of modern science is producing increasing doubt about
traditional distinctions between scientific disciplines, and the
relationship between science, society and human consciousness. With this
emerges an opportunity to disrupt the metasystem of each individual and
to present new work at the interface between (for example) biology and
quantum mechanics, or consciousness as an opportunity to ask “are you
sure about this?”</p>

<div class="section" id="science-s-uncertainty-and-the-cultivation-of-conversation">
<h2>Science’s Uncertainty and the Cultivation of Conversation<a class="headerlink" href="#science-s-uncertainty-and-the-cultivation-of-conversation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The common link between scientific inquiry in the enlightenment and a
science of uncertainty is the importance of conversation. In the
enlightenment, reproducible experiment was a spur to the conversation
between scientists as they sought to establish causal descriptions for
the phenomena they observed. I have argued throughout this book that
uncertainty is the driver of conversation, and conversation is the best
way to manage uncertainty. A cybernetic approach to an uncertain science
requires that the ‘institution of science’ cultivates the coordination
of conversation.</p>
<p>Technology and scientific uncertainty can come together in the
cultivation of conversation. Computers, through their power to generate
multiple descriptions of reality, can assist in the process of
amplifying differences between different ways of understanding the
world. There are examples of where computers are currently used like
this in collaborative and creative work. The use of shared editors can
help the process of coordinating the expectations and constraints of
many individuals in producing a final document. In architecture and
design, computers generate multiple descriptions of possibilities around
which different stakeholders in the design process will reveal their
distinctions and coordinate their constraints with one another. The use
of a computer in a citizen science experiment to identify the parameters
of a phenomenon is similarly a process of mapping-out areas of
uncertainty about particular options. In each case, the computer creates
new options for acting by giving each stakeholder a simple interface
(attenuation) which aggregates and distributes the collective effort
(amplification). Alongside visual screen-based manifestations of the
computer, there is an increasing array of physical manifestations,
including 3D printed models, buildings, and self-published books (like
this one). The computer aids multiplicity of description through the
various means of online publishing - from blogs to shared editors - and
each affords new opportunities for conversation.</p>
<p>The actions of scientists occur within the context of multiple
descriptions of the world, and computers are capable algorithmically
enhancing this multiplicity. The algorithm’s rearrangement of data
creates a multiplicity of objects upon which the human intellect can
operate. This automatically-generated multiplicity can also provide a
focus for conversation: where the use of computers in human inquiry is
most powerful, it is in the exploitation of the computer as the
generator of powerful shared representations of multiplicity, as for
example, in the myriad of data visualisation. However, this multiplicity
carries with it the danger that the computer’s generative powers are
seen in some way to be <em>mimetic</em> - imitating nature - and consequently,
the computer’s results are taken as being an objective and unarguable
statement about reality which consequently stifles conversation.</p>
<p>Conversation, experiment, theorising, the development of new techniques,
apparatus, and new ways of communicating ideas remain the essential
foundation for scientific progress from the enlightenment onwards, but
the computer introduces uncertainty where the enlightenment scientists
saw certainty. The new uncertainties concern the choices which are made
in establishing experiments in the first place. Within what constraints
are distinctions made as to which variables should be observed, which
are dependent or independent? Upon what criteria are the results of an
experiment to be considered reliable? With what certainty can a theory
be said to be correct? Opening up the possibilities for acting
introduces uncertainty in all these things, and with it there is an
unfolding of different levels of recursion in the scientific
conversation.</p>
<p>One of the constraints within which experiments are conceived and
results discussed is the institution of education itself. How do the
expectations of a discourse, or the particular requirements of a journal
affect choices of scientific action? We see the effect of computers both
on the practices of science in the capture and analysis of data, and in
the structuring of the institution of education. In both cases, new
options for acting are introduced, in both cases, new uncertainties are
introduced, and these uncertainties interfere with one another.</p>
<p>Tools are used to rank research, scientists, and the institutions which
host scholars, and these attenuating factors feed in to the practices of
science. Yet when the acknowledgement of the essential uncertainty of
any published result is neglected, the difficulties of reproducing any
published result are presented as a ‘scandal’ of unprofessional
scientific practice [&#64;pashler_editors_2012]. Such problems may instead
be the consequence of an uncertainty which was inherent in the work in
the first place, but which through the unique set of constraints
emerging in education and scientific publishing in the light of
technology, now struggles to express itself. The scientific journal has
become the marker of professional authenticity (relatively unchanged
from the 17^th^ century), whilst journals themselves rely on a
peer-review system which many regard as broken [&#64;smith_peer_2006].</p>

<p>Science has advanced with new technologies for making observations of
nature. New scientific instruments generate new descriptions which in
turn produces new accounts of methods, new descriptions of things
witnessed and new theories to account for what is seen. From Galileo’s
telescope to Hooke’s microscope, the electron microscope, DNA
sequencers, or to the Large Hadron Collider, new descriptions about
nature present possibilities for generating new models from which new
predictions about phenomena may be made. At the same time, the
relationship between the technology of scientific instruments and the
theories which arise is complex. Bhaskar [&#64;bhaskar_realist_2008] cites
the example of the relationship between Hooke’s Law and the spring
balance where the balance is used for testing the Law, whilst also
exploiting its principles. The close-coupling between instruments and
scientific theories becomes more explicit when considering the
relationship between meanings imputed to visualisations produced through
big data algorithms, and the logic behind the algorithms themselves.
Methods of experiment and analysis supported by tools are not simply a
means of acquiring results: both method, results and theory represent
implicit alternative (and sometimes contradictory) descriptions of
nature. Potential contradictions are exacerbated by the power of the
computer, where the identification of pattern and the development of
theory become more closely entwined.</p>
<p>Computers can amplify the multiplicity of descriptions generated by a
new scientific instrument, which (increasingly) is also governed by a
computer. Algorithms can be used to transform patterns, change colours,
focus on particular features, or identify patterns of recursion in the
observed structure. The difference between a pattern-led approach to
science driven by the computer and a theory-led approach can be seen as
the difference between two methods of managing the uncertainty of
explanation. A pattern-led approach attenuates through the
identification of an appearance of real phenomena through algorithmic
behaviour, which is unlikely to be fully codified. A theory-led approach
attenuates uncertainty by extensive codification of a generative
mechanism responsible for phenomena within a social context that
connects the description of this mechanism with prior theory and future
development. Moreover, in a theory-led approach, the different aspects
of theory are organised heterarchically, necessitating a similar open
heterarchical organisational structure to support the theory’s
evolution. In this way for example, quantum theory maintains branches
and influence across the curriculum at many different levels. The
pattern-led computer approach, however, concentrates explanation within
the confines of technology experts who conceive of the algorithm, and
erects barriers to participation in the inquiry to those who do not
understand the technology.</p>
<p>The difference between an algorithmic pattern-driven approach to
explanation and a theory-driven approach lies at the nexus between
epistemology and the institutional organisation of inquiry. Put most
simply, algorithmic science reinforces the hierarchy of the institution
of science by concentrating the management of scientific uncertainty in
the hands of technologists coordinating a technology which is not fully
understood, but produces patterns which are seen to be mimetic. Theory,
by contrast, develops constellations of concepts and techniques each of
which is connected to the others, and which necessitate
transdisciplinary dialogue to develop. The institutional question is how
such a dialogue may be coordinated. A theory-driven approach to science
may however, frustrate those who pursue the technological path because
it may be seen to slow down technological progress in favour of
enriching a collective discourse. It may be seen to be a <em>limiting</em>
force on the development of technology and science. However, there is a
strong case to make that this limiting of technology is an important
function within an uncertain science.</p>
<p>Ivan Illich saw the limiting of technology as a <em>political</em> and
<em>dialogical</em> process. He argued that only by politicising tools and
scientific progress can a viable society achieve balance between the
meeting of its needs and caring for the environment which sustains it,
just as Ulrich Beck comments that</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“Technological change is legitimated social change without political
legitimation”[&#64;beck_risk_1992 203]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Illich argued:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>We must come to admit that only within limits can machines take the
place of slaves; beyond these limits they lead to a new kind of
serfdom. Only within limits can education fit people into a man-made
environment: beyond these limits lies the universal schoolhouse,
hospital ward, or prison. Only within limits ought politics to be
concerned with the distribution of maximum industrial outputs, rather
than with equal inputs of either energy or information. Once these
limits are recognized, it becomes possible to articulate the triadic
relationship between persons, tools, and a new collectivity. Such a
society, in which modern technologies serve politically interrelated
individuals rather than managers, I will call ‘convivial.’
[&#64;illich_tools_2001 xii]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Illich’s work points to a different kind of institution of science. It
is structured heterarchically not only because the hierarchies of
traditional education are ill-suited to a technological world where
individuals have vastly increased options to act. It is structured
heterarchically because the uncertainties of science itself demands an
institution able to flexibly adapt its model of an environment which is
inherently uncertain. This means that such an institution must manage
rich and flexible levels of recursion and interconnection in the way
that the theories which it builds for itself can be developed and
refined. But, just as Beer argued that a viable system must contain a
model of itself, this construction of scientific knowledge must also
construct a theory of the technologies of its scientific instruments and
its technologies of communication.</p>

<h2>Thought, Technology, Talk and Artefacts<a class="headerlink" href="#thought-technology-talk-and-artefacts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Science is the product of thought and action. Thought itself is a
process which produces theories, knowledge, tools, paintings, music and
so on. These things are epiphenomena, or biproducts of thought. David
Bohm pointed out that in the end, thought produces everything; that so
many of the things that thought produces cause the kind of problems that
Illich and Beer worried about, it is because our thinking denies that
thinking itself is responsible. Another way of putting this is that
thought generates constraints which constrain thought’s grasp of itself.</p>
<p>One aspect of confusion about thought’s role in the production of the
world is the dualistic separation that is made between what appears to
us as material reality and consciousness. Among the varieties of
intellectual position which has challenged dualism, what has become
known as ‘sociomateriality’ [&#64;barad_meeting_2007] and Latour’s
associated ‘actor network theory’ [&#64;latour_reassembling_2007] which uses
the quantum-mechanical metaphor of ‘entanglement’ as a way of
articulating reality as an aggregate of constraints produced by
‘actors.’ There has been much philosophical speculation about the nature
of objects, actors and technologies and their relation to human
activity. The rapid rise of AI and robotics lead Latour and others to
argue that technologies are actors that perform functions comparable to
those of humans, and that social reality can be seen as a set of
relations between human and technological actors. However, behind this
position is a central question about the relationship between the
processes of thought (in consciousness and human agency), and the
products of thought (in technologies and artefacts).</p>
<p>If artefacts, including technologies, are the products of thought, they
are also the constraints of thought. Artefacts constrain the environment
within which people think and act, and since everybody thinks in a
different way, an artefact can be revealing of the different ways people
think. For example, a single chair in a room might illuminate who is
most in need of sitting down, or it might illuminate who is least
thoughtful in grabbing the chair for themselves, or it might reveal who
is most disruptive in picking up the chair and throwing it, or it might
reveal who is most curious in prompting a question to others about the
chair. The point is that in an environment of shared constraints,
thought’s processes reveal one person to another. A constraint is an
invitation to make new descriptions of reality and the environment we
are in, either verbally or with our bodies.</p>
<p>Thoughts produce constraints bearing upon others, and among the things
that thought does is to make objects - either physical artefacts or
software - each of which contributes to the environment of constraint
within which thought operates. In making different descriptions in the
light of various constraints, we reveal our constraints to one another,
and it is through revealing constraints to one another that we are able
to communicate.</p>
<p>When objects (for example robots or AI) behave autonomously in an
environment, or change in their behaviour according to the different
things that are done to them, powerful and sophisticated constraints can
overwhelm the human capacity to maintain effective organisation. The
resulting uncertainty is then fed into the institutions of science,
which organise their inquiries in such a way as to defend their
structures. However, David Bohm argued that “science is involved in a
perceptual enterprise.” As a perceptual enterprise, the principle object
of scientific inquiry lies in understanding the process of thought
itself. The problem is that within the structured hierarchies of
knowledge in the institution of education, this process is becoming
increasingly difficult to coordinate.</p>
<p>Bohm was one of the pioneers of quantum mechanics, from which the
concept of entanglement comes. He argued that this ‘uncertain science’
demands greater attention to the understanding of ‘thought as
process’[&#64;bohm_wholeness_2002]. Our computer technologies, which have
further exacerbated the uncertainty of the environment, may yet provide
a means of creating a new kind of ‘institution of uncertain science’
which privileges and synergises the conditions for conversation which
Bohm believed were essential. It is to technology’s role in facilitating
the articulation of uncertainty and dialogue that we turn in the next
chapter.</p>

<div class="section" id="openness-and-scarcity">
<h2>Openness and Scarcity<a class="headerlink" href="#openness-and-scarcity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>‘Openness’ is a distinction which makes no sense unless considered in
the context of what is meant by ‘closed.’ Openness is always a challenge
to closure. The relationship between the two is dialectical: the
cumulative effect of exclusion and declared scarcity leads eventually to
a challenge to that exclusion. Such appears to be the case in the
earliest claim for openness in the wake of Magna Carta. In 1217 the
‘Charter of the Forest’ was an agreement between the crown and the
people where the crown recognised the unsustainability of its control
over vast amounts of land, eventually declaring much of the forests to
be ‘common land’ - a distinction which has remained in force ever since.</p>
<p>Claims for ‘open education’ similarly challenge the declared scarcity of
learning resources, academic publishing, certification opportunities,
and membership of intellectual discourse. The challenge has been
reinforced by the increase in opportunities to do new things with
technology, but as with all things with technology, this has been
accompanied by increasing uncertainty within education as a whole. It is
in the environment of increased uncertainty that the costs of education,
and particularly those of academic journals and textbooks have soared,
with institutions who provide reviewers and authors for free left
footing the bill for subscriptions. Governments too find that their
state-funded research is only able to be disseminated in print forms
which are exclusive and closed. The closure of academic publishing sits
in dialectical relation to the abundance of publishing opportunities
afforded by technology. The closedness of the publisher’s model results
from a declaration of scarcity upheld by intellectual property laws: for
something to be ‘closed’ it needs to be declared as scarce.</p>
<p>Scarcity in education results partly from declarations about educational
resources by institutions and publishers. More broadly declarations
about access to institutions themselves are upheld through the setting
of entry tariffs and fees. Progressive institutional movements like the
UK’s Open University sought to address this in the 1960s, but movement
towards reducing artifically-declared scarcity has been shadowed by a
parallel movement within institutions and publishers which has had an
opposite effect by using technology to <em>increase</em> scarcity, most
obviously exemplified by the journal paywall. This process reveals that
the dialectic of open/closed often amounts to shifts in the way scarcity
is generated rather than its elimination. At a deeper level, both the
drive for openness and its opposite are responses to the increased
opportunities and accompanying uncertainties generated by technology.
The institutional response has been to attenuate technological
possibility, with methods of attenuation including:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Limiting access to powerful tools and scientific instruments;</p></li>
<li><p>Proliferation of ‘professions’ which certificate and control those
‘qualified’ to operate powerful tools;</p></li>
<li><p>Creating scarcity in the acquisition of professional certification;</p></li>
<li><p>Leveraging emerging educational markets with increased
financialisation of knowledge and learning opportunities;</p></li>
<li><p>Fostering specialised discourses to drive the generation of new
powerful tools which will keep the attenuating mechanism operating;</p></li>
<li><p>Protecting the intellectual property around educational
interventions and new tools.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To say that these are all <em>closed</em> mechanisms is to say that they are
attenuative of the possibilities afforded by technology. They react to
the uncertainty produced by technology by reinforcing the boundary
between the institution and society. All measures are designed to create
and maintaining scarcity at various levels: at the level of access to
tools, access to certification for operating tools; access to financial
resources to pay for eduction; access to ideas and new thinking about
tools. Among the systemic consequences of this, the privileged role of
publishers as the gatekeepers of what is allowed to be published and
what isn’t, and who is allowed to read it is most critical.</p>
<p>Since the university’s attenuative system depends on maintaining the
scarcity of publication of knowledge, and individual academics operate
within this system by claiming their elevated status according to their
acceptance for publication, the university has become beholden to
publishers who soak up increasing amounts of the university budget.
Academics (who work for journals for free) and students (who pay
ever-increasing fees partly to cover the costs of access to publication)
get squeezed in the relationship between the mutually-reinforcing
business models of the university and the publisher as shown in Figure
<a class="reference external" href="#ref:pubuni">6.1</a>{reference-type=”ref” reference=”ref:pubuni”}. Anybody
without access to the institution’s journal holdings is at a
disadvantage if they wish to engage with the scientific discourse. With
the increased financialisation of education, this exclusion around
education is increasingly falling between socio-economic categories: the
voices lost from scientific debate are often the poor and
under-privileged. The consequence of this is that education uses
technology as a means of reinforcing the division between the academy
and the society that maintains it. Technological innovation increasingly
comes as the expense of a destroyed social environment.</p>
<p><img alt="Positive feedback between the business models of publishers andUniversities" src="_images/pubuni.jpg" />{#ref:pubuni width=”\textwidth”}</p>
<p>Why not admit blogs into the scientific literature? Why do we continue
to publish academic journal articles within a peer-review system which
is clearly broken? Why not publish open textbooks which can be modified
by teachers? Why not publish research data in forms where others can do
their own experiments on it? Why is there no incentive to communicate
science in ways other than expensive conferences or papers which nobody
reads? Why do we separate research from teaching?</p>
<p>There are initiatives to address some of these questions. Open
textbooks, for example, have acquired powerful backing
[&#64;wiley_preliminary_2012] - although there is as yet little evidence of
widespread adoption, and alternatives to peer review and the publication
of data have been attempted. For the majority, little seems to have
changed. However, the initiative to address the scarcity problem with
the greatest impact was the development of the Massive Open Online
Course (MOOC).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="moocs-and-open-scarcity">
<h2>MOOCs and ‘Open Scarcity’<a class="headerlink" href="#moocs-and-open-scarcity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The topic of openness, its aims and ambitions has become a topic within
educational technology, with its own conferences, discourse, and the
subject of books which attempt to categorise and codify it
[&#64;weller_battle_2014]. Unfortunately, as with all attempts to codify
specific aspects of practice, the ‘open education’ topic inevitably
declares the scarcity of itself where certain positions are admissible
within the discourse of “open education,” and other things are rejected.
As is a common pattern in educational technology, ‘openness’ has become
a niche area. In this ‘closing of openness,’ sight can been lost of the
necessity of ‘openness’ for understanding deeper dynamics in society,
science and politics as well as education.</p>
<p>The advocacy of openness falls into the categories of the organisation
of the institution. Openness has many underlying drivers, none of which
are entirely coherent. They include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>economic arguments which state that the re-use of resources is more
cost-effective for the institution</p></li>
<li><p>social arguments which advocate removing barriers of cost to
education</p></li>
<li><p>institutional arguments which situate open practice as a form of
widening participation</p></li>
<li><p>pedagogic arguments which present open practice as transparent
pedagogy and an opportunity for pedagogic development</p></li>
<li><p>openness as “consumerism, academic-style’ making scholarship cheaper
[&#64;fuller_open_nodate]</p></li>
<li><p>openness as a means of moving from grand narrative to bricolage</p></li>
<li><p>openness as marketing of institutions and courses</p></li>
</ul>
<p>With or without the official advocacy of groups which promote it, open
practice in education is evident on YouTube, email Listservs, Twitter,
Facebook, LinkedIn, blogs and wikis. These forms of openness have
proliferated where more formal initiatives to create repositories of
learning objects, or Open Educational Resources which can be integrated
within the institution’s VLE have floundered. JISC’s Jorum service
started at roughly the same time as Salman Khan’s ‘Khan Academy.’ Khan’s
use of short educational videos published on YouTube and made easily
discoverable by Google search, quickly grew with the support of
large-scale funding from platform owners (Google) who could exploit
Khan’s approach to increase traffic to their platform and thereby
increase revenue. Jorum, by contrasted, was visited far less and
eventually folded.</p>
<p>Institutional engagement with ‘open’ took the form of decisions by
universities to make educational content available for free online,
beginning with MIT OpenCourseware in 2001. The MOOC was a natural
development from this, which took an open ethos and packaged it up in
resources and forum-based discussions around particular topics which
individual universities could deliver. Although initially piloted as an
experiment in constructivist pedagogy [&#64;downes_03._nodate], MOOCs were
speculatively promoted by companies looking to find a financially viable
model of sustainability. In pursuit of this, the MOOC presented
opportunities to market institutions and their courses, to promote
individual star academics, to serve the needs of employers in training
employees, or in selecting new recruits, and some MOOCs presented
opportunities for paid micro-credentials. However, as with the business
models of social media corporations, their chief exploitable asset
appeared to be the data they collected about students, their interests
and their patterns of engagement.</p>
<p>Are MOOCs open? The principal criterion for judging the openness of any
educational intervention is whether it maintains (or indeed, reinforces)
or challenges the basic declaration of scarcity of knowledge, and the
consequent scarcity of the institution of education. MOOCs remained tied
to the curriculum and to the institution’s formal (non-free) offering.
They reinforced the institution as the gatekeeper of learning
opportunities where the deficiencies of the online experience could be
used to promote the richness of the face-to-face experience. MOOCs
reinforced the scarcity of the academic star, with a list of prestigious
publications behind them, and belonging to an elite institution which
itself reinforced its scarcity through admission criteria.</p>
<p>Similar critiques of other initiative to promote ‘openness’ can be made.
For example, Learning Objects
[&#64;wiley_instructional_2002; &#64;boyle_design_2003] reinforced a component-
oriented reductionism of the curriculum (which it derived from the
component-orientation of software), whilst implicitly rendering the
activity of teaching to the search for and assemblage of tools and
resources. Open Education Resources in turn reinforced curriculum
structures and disciplinary separation, while turning the teacher into a
bricoleur.</p>
<p>None of these approaches have mounted a serious challenge to the
traditional structures and practices of the institution. Few of them
dealt with the problem of science, uncertainty and knowledge production.
Most of the commercial offerings took a ‘banking’ model of education and
few of them saw the contributions of their students as the key
opportunity for developing the knowledge base (although online
initiatives like ‘ds106’ [&#64;levine_mooc_2014] did encourage creatively
diverse behaviour from participants). Few of them sought to harness
technology as a way of reorganising how the transactions between
learners and each other, teachers and other experts could be managed
better than the traditional course with its cohort models and batch
assessment. None of them sought to exploit new ways in which
technologies could be used to help learners achieve meaningful things
through the publication of new research, supporting empirical work,
developing new projects or driving new forms of community engagement.
Why not?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="status-pathology">
<h2>Status pathology<a class="headerlink" href="#status-pathology" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The systemic problems with openness go deeper than simply the engagement
with learners on courses, whether online or not. Status connects the
career ambitions of academics with assessment of students, institutional
prestige, publication in respected journals, citation metrics and
university ranking tables.</p>
<p>Any change to social standing rests on declarations by others in a
society. The university is a social entity granted the power to award
degrees to students. The university degree certificate carries a signal
which is intended to influence a potential employer to favour its
possessor [&#64;stiglitz_creating_2014] in the competition about who gets
the job and who doesn’t. Degree certificates are hard to come by not
just because they require the student to have passed certain exams in
their course, but because the university itself may be regarded as being
‘difficult to get in to,’ or a place which gives access to prestigious
social networks. Each of these are indicators of scarcity, and sometimes
proxy indicators of the scarcity of membership of a social or economic
class [&#64;bourdieu_reproduction_1990].</p>
<p>The University’s acquisition of the status to make proclamations about
the status of its students rests on government statutes which themselves
are declarations. Rather like the declarations whereby corporations or
businesses establish themselves as entities, this is the way any society
creates institutions and invests them with particular powers. Such
declarations belong to what Searle has called ‘status functions’: ways
of bringing into being the stuff of the social world - whether it is
universities, presidents, money or property rights
[&#64;searle_making_2011].</p>
<p>Recent years have seen a proliferation in the production of institutions
of higher education. Maintaining scarcity in education means
increasingly that the mere proclamation by statute that an institution
is a university able to confer degrees is not seen to be enough.
Distinctions between <em>good</em> universities and less good ones maintains
the scarcity of the good ones assessed according to a variety of
metrics, including the quality of the research the institution produces.
‘High quality’ itself then depends on further levels of declaration by
other agencies. In the case of research, the publication of
‘influential’ research in a journal which is hard to get published in is
seen as an enhanced marker of status both of the academic and their
institution. The status of research is accorded to it by an editorial
panel whose job it is to maintain the reputation of the journal. This is
shown in Figure <a class="reference external" href="#ref:pubuni">6.1</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”ref:pubuni”} on the left-hand side of the diagram.</p>
<p>For academics, publication in high ranking research journals brings the
prospect of promotion and potential job security in what is increasingly
an insecure profession, or it brings increased funding within the
institution. Institutions with many academics producing high-ranking
research papers perform more highly in international rankings of
institutions, which in turn increase their chances of winning research
funding and recruiting high calibre students. This is shown in Figure
<a class="reference external" href="#ref:pubuni">6.1</a>{reference-type=”ref” reference=”ref:pubuni”} on the
right hand side.</p>
<p>Each declaration of status is also a declaration of scarcity, and the
principal mode of operation of the institution is the declaring of
knowledge and accreditation for knowing it to be scarce. While this sits
at odds with the growth of technologies which provide access to
knowledge everywhere, beyond publication itself, citations serve as
‘evidence’ of approval by a community. Fame and status as a “thought
leader” [&#64;sismondo_key_2013] comes from many citations, which in turn
brings invitations to keynotes at conferences, editorial roles, expert
advisory positions, through to secondary studies of an author’s work.
Fundamentally, there is a demarcation between ‘academic celebrity’ and
everyone else: academic publication counts because it is (or is
perceived to be) scarce. This state of affairs raises ontological
questions about how the social world of science and education works.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="speech-acts">
<h2>Speech Acts<a class="headerlink" href="#speech-acts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Declarations of scarcity uphold the status of academics, institutions,
certificates and journals. In analysing the declarations which
constitute institutions, businesses and governments, Searle’s concept of
the ‘status function’ describes a declaration whereby something is said
to exist by somebody who is granted power by their community to make
such declarations, and where that community believes in the existence of
the thing that is declared. In Searle’s analysis , he makes a three-way
distinction between:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>a declaration of the form “<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> counts as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> in context <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C\)</span>” - which
is the basic form of declaration for degree certificates, journal
articles, university ranking tables, and so forth</p></li>
<li><p>the power of the individual or agency who makes the declaration
(what Searle calls ‘deontic power’)</p></li>
<li><p>The community for whom the declaration is asserted as being valid
whose “collective intentionality” is in agreement with the
declaration.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Status functions are recursive: somebody with deontic power to make
declarations has acquired that deontic power by virtue of other status
functions. For example, a monarch has the deontic power to ratify laws,
but this power was granted to the monarch by virtue of some ancient
declaration. In the scientific domain, the deontic power of scientists,
editors are similarly dependent on declarations. If the person making
the declaration has sufficient ‘deontic power’ and the community within
which it is made upholds it (through what Searle calls “collective
intentionality”), then the status function will be binding in its
context.</p>
<p>Declarations are oriented in practices and conventions involving people
and technologies. In the case of science, practices involve the
investigation, corroboration, falsification and publication of new work.
As Feyerabend [&#64;feyerabend_against_2010] indicates, scientific practice
involves not only the rational evaluation of theories, but also the
individual egos of scientists. The way that status functions become
established through editorial boards reinforces the “deontic power” of
those upholding them sometimes making intellectual positions resistant
to critical attack. Scientific publication is part of the dynamic
relationships between the content of intellectual inquiry, the persons
of scientists and the structure of society. In reality, many journals
struggle to make effective status declarations as evidenced by numerous
publishing ‘scandals’ such as Sokal [&#64;sokal_beyond_2009] or Vamplew
[&#64;safi_journal_2014], yet publication practices within the academy
remain largely unchallenged.</p>
<p>In academic publishing, reviewers and editors have the deontic power to
make the status declaration for a particular article. Depending on the
quality of the journal, this is also a ‘scarcity’ declaration:
publication in some journals is more difficult (and therefore more
scare) than in others. The upholding of deontic power by editorial
boards feeds into other processes of status declaration which relate to
the relative worth of different publications. Algorithmic processes
overseen by international agencies responsible for indexing published
work make higher-level declarations about the relative statuses of
journals. These processes are driven by citation indexes where highly
cited work will reflect on the statuses of the author, their institution
and the journal. Authors in academic communities uphold the declarations
of journal editors and authors by citing work, whilst scientific
indexing agencies uphold the declarations inherent in citation practices
by ranking journals, and international university ranking agencies
declare the relative statuses of institutions.</p>

<h2>From Uncertainty to the Marketisation of Education<a class="headerlink" href="#from-uncertainty-to-the-marketisation-of-education" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The problem of intellectual communication can be characterised as a
network of interacting constraints operating within an uncertain
environment. This can be related to different kinds of declaration of
status or scarcity. Among the most important of these declarations are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The declaration of scarcity of publication in journals for authors</p></li>
<li><p>The declaration of scarcity of access to journals by institutions
and publishers</p></li>
<li><p>The declaration of scarcity of status of institutions through league
tables</p></li>
<li><p>The declaration of scarcity of intellectual work within the
universities</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Technology has provided anybody with the options to publish their work
in many more ways than used to be possible. The commandeering of
technology by publishers (and some academics) to create a wall around
the official literature and keep it separate from unofficial
self-published literature has generated scarcity around official
knowledge which didn’t exist before computers. Before the internet, a
natural scarcity was created in the fact that publishing itself was
labour intensive and therefore required some kind of filter to be
created around it. The scarcity of publishing was merely a manifestation
of the inability to publish everything. With the ability to publish and
disseminate anything, uncertainties around publication have increased.
The status pathology - the creation of artificial scarcity - is the
institution’s way of mopping-up this uncertainty.</p>
<p>Status and scarcity are backed-up with associated economic mechanisms.
To make anything scarce is to increase its desirability, and
consequently, the amount of money which one might pay to become one of
the few who has access to it. It is not just a coincidence that
technology and the marketisation of higher education have grown at the
same time: they are fundamentally connected. With growth in scarcity
comes the creation of a market and the gradual financialisation of
knowledge which gains the label of the ‘knowledge economy.’</p>
<p>Access to published work in high ranking journals can attract a monetary
value greater than work published in less highly-ranked journals. Since
academic job security is dependent on acceptance by the academy, and
since the means of gaining acceptance is to engage with the scholarship
in high-ranking journals, publishers can demand a high price from
university libraries for access to published work. Scholars in less
well-ranked institutions with smaller budgets to support their libraries
will find themselves at a disadvantage in not having access to the
top-ranked journal literature. The costs of journals is passed on to
students in universities, and access to intellectual debate tends to be
concentrated within universities whose own status is enhanced by their
position as a gateway to high ranking scholarship. Universities employ
academics who they expect to be publishing in high-ranking journals and
as individual academic reputation is enhanced through publication, the
status of journals is enhanced by their maintenance of scarcity of
publication, whilst the university declares scarcity of access to ‘star’
academics. For individuals, successful publication increases job
security because it reinforces the scarcity declaration by the
institution.</p>
<p>The measurement of the relative status of institutions through league
tables is a recent development. Publishing organisations like
Thompson-Reuters [&#64;noauthor_qs_nodate], or the Times Higher Educational
Supplement[&#64;noauthor_thes_nodate] act as de-facto academic credit-rating
agencies for institutions, and their judgements have causal effects on
institutional viability. Academic ranking has become an industry in
itself. It is not normal today for position in international league
tables to be a Key Performance Indicator within university strategies.
Ranking affects the ability of universities to attract students,
research, and in seeking of new sources of funding through financial
instruments like bonds [&#64;mcgettigan_great_2013].</p>
<p>The academic journal itself was a product of the enlightenment, and
particularly the Royal Society, whose ‘Transactions’ first published in
1667 established practices of blind peer-review. Printing facilitated
the formation of large-scale scientific communities within which
reproducible empirical results could be reported and discussed. This was
not only an intervention in scientific practice and epistemology, but
also in the democratisation of intellectual inquiry and status
acquisition. Publication and admittance to the academy was technically
available to all. The overthrow of Aristotelian doctrine and the new
priority given to observation and experiment supported this democratic
movement: the epistemological shift occurred alongside the shift in
communicative practice facilitated by technology. This model was
well-suited to knowledge that was seen to be ‘objective’ where causal
relations could be established in discourse among a group of scientists
in the light of experimental results. As scientific knowledge has become
increasingly uncertain, and probabilistic, emphasis on the production of
empirical regularities has shifted towards the production of statistical
regularities. This raises a question as to how the uncertainties lying
behind claims of ‘statistical significance’ in results might best be
communicated.</p>

<div class="section" id="communicating-uncertainty">
<h2>Communicating Uncertainty<a class="headerlink" href="#communicating-uncertainty" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>While being well-suited to the detailed description of apparatus, method
and results from which speculation about causes could follow, the
journal article is less well-suited to the communication of the
probabilistic and contingent nature of today’s science. When the
probabilistic modelling of economics, patterns in DNA, the analysis of
big data, or the investigation of psychological or educational phenomena
are represented in the journal literature, the reported statistically
significant results (presented as p-values and statistical hypothesis)
mask the usually far more significant uncertainties surrounding the
work. If uncertainties are communicated at all, they are represented at
the end of papers as “future directions for research.”</p>
<p>The problem is systemic and related to the status of journals and their
relationship to the corresponding status of academics and institutions.
Attempts to address it have focused on the closedness of publication
rather than the communication of uncertainty. For example, ‘guerrilla’
tactics to open-up closed journals have appeared, with Sci-Hub being a
celebrated example [&#64;bohannon_whos_2016] which breaks the copyright of
publishers by making journal articles available for free. New models of
peer-review have been introduced alongside new models of open-access
publishing [&#64;anderson_open_2004]. Yet the “scarcity problem” remains:
open access publications offers authors or institutions opportunities to
‘buy’ increased chances of citation, leaving other aspects of the
publication system intact. Little of this, however, addresses the
problem of how scientific uncertainty should be communicated:
mis-alignment between discursive practice and a transformed epistemology
brings the scientific communication system to breaking-point. Journals
struggle to get good reviewers, bibliometrics drives research and
commodifies academics, and marketisation has made education in many
countries increasingly unaffordable. Openness of publication is very
different from openness in the communication of uncertainty.</p>
<p>These problems of scientific communication became the principal concern
of David Bohm, whose work in quantum mechanics led him to focus on the
way scientists talk to each other. For Bohm, observing academia in the
1970s and 80s, science had become a game of one-upmanship, which
ultimately meant that few would present their uncertainties about their
knowledge, and individual scientists were more concerned with defending
their positions rather than listening to each other
[&#64;bohm_dialogue_2013]. This he saw as a fundamental error of thought,
which masked the deeper nature of thought to which he believed all
scientific phenomena are related. Dialogue for Bohm was more than a way
of talking; it was itself a scientific practice of observing thought as
a process:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Dialogue is really aimed at going into the whole thought process and
changing the way the thought process occurs collectively. We haven’t
really paid much attention to thought as a process. We have engaged in
thoughts, but we have only paid attention to the content, not to the
process. Why does thought require attention? Everything requires
attention, really. If we ran machines without paying attention to
them, they would break down. Or thought, too, is a process, and it
requires attention otherwise it’s going to go wrong.
[&#64;bohm_dialogue_2013 10]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The pathologies of closedness, artificial scarcity, reductionism and
status are all symptoms of what Bohm called ‘thought going wrong.’ The
openness of dialogue was explicitly tied to Bohm’s model of the natural
world which he developed from his quantum theory: reality was
constituted by thought, but scientists deny that thought was responsible
and instead reach for the products of thought rather than seek to
understand its processes. Bohm believed that when engaged in dialogue,
the process of thought itself could be apprehended, and consequently the
fundamental structure of nature, or what he called the ‘implicate order’
[&#64;bohm_wholeness_2002] could be glimpsed:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Almost everything around us has been determined by thought - all the
buildings, factories, farms, roads, schools nations, science,
technology, religion - whatever you care to mention. The whole
ecological problem is due to thought, because we have thought that the
world is there for us to exploit, that it is infinite, and so no
matter what we did, the pollution would all get dissolved
away.[&#64;bohm_dialogue_2013 11]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Openness, from Bohm’s perspective, was not simply about shifting
declarations of scarcity by, for example, making journals free, or
institutions more accessible. It was instead an attitude of mind which
acknowledged and expressed contingency in the company of others doing
the same. Openness is part of the intersubjective relation, where the
structures of consciousness, as it was understood by Husserl and Schutz,
revealed themselves. And perhaps most importantly, openness was about
the process of revealing rather than the product of what is revealed. In
other words, Bohm’s openness dismantles the barrier between teaching and
research.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="teaching-and-science">
<h2>Teaching and Science<a class="headerlink" href="#teaching-and-science" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the modern university, teaching and research are separated. Each of
them has acquired its own kind of bureaucracy and this bureaucracy has
made it increasingly difficult to bridge the gap between the pursuit and
acquisition of scientific understanding and the communication of that
understanding. The bureaucracy of teaching involves the delivery of
lectures and seminars to ever-increasing numbers of students who
represent the core income of most institutions. Teachers have the
unenviable task of marking hundreds of exams and assignments, under
pressure to meet student expectations, and submitting to regimes of
educational ‘quality.’ In recent times, the quality of the performances
in lectures and seminars has come under further scrutiny with various
abstract metrics to indicate and compare ‘teaching quality.’</p>
<p>The bureaucratic machine around research staff revolves around
scientific communication through high-ranking journals. Researchers also
have the job of winning research contracts and running research
projects, although success here also depends of the quality of
scientific publication. While some researchers will recruit PhD students
and be involved teaching at an advanced level, many research staff are
excused from undergraduate teaching. Failure to win research contracts
or failure to publish in sufficiently impactful journals can bring job
insecurity. Success is measured in terms of publication in high-ranking
journals and bibliometric measures of esteem. Success for the
researchers can bring media attention, and enhance the status of the
institution, thereby making it more attractive to students.</p>
<p>It is not uncommon for there to exist snobbery between those on research
contracts and those on teaching contracts. Staff have different
prospects for promotion, and for the teachers, the vaguaries of
‘teaching excellence’ have lead to other bureaucratic demarcations of
privilege in the institution. Bohm’s insight into the nature of thought
as a process presents a possible explanation for this. Fundamentally,
the snobbery arises from privileging the product of thought over its
process. Bohm suggests it should be the other way round. The university,
as a place of scientific inquiry, contains processes of teaching and
processes of thinking, but if these processes are seen as functions
which produce results, and the results of research are seen to be more
prestigious than the results of teaching, then a division of these
functions is a natural consequence. However, if the process of thought
is privileged over its product, then the institution becomes a place of
dialogue and the divisions between teaching and research dissolve.</p>
<p>An example of the privileging of the products of thought over its
processes is the increasing demand on university teachers to exploit the
latest technologies to deliver their lessons. The slickness of modern
media in the communication of science creates its own kind of scarcity.
In turn this creates problems of expectation among students and staff.
For many universities, a natural temptation is to aim to imitate
professional media productions with the aid of lavishly-produced visual
effects. Yet, media spectacles all-too-often hide the uncertainties of
knowledge, rather than reveal them, just as teachers will sometimes seek
to hide their uncertainty of a subject behind a Powerpoint presentation.
Technology however, can be used to highlight the processes of thought.
The use of time-based media such as video or audio to express
uncertainties - whether with regard to a scientific idea, or in relation
to the analysis of student work - can be a spur to dialogue and openness
rather than the ‘closedness’ of the polished resource. Quickly-produced
amateur technological interventions don’t just express uncertainties of
the person making them; they also invite others to try the same thing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="technology-and-thought-as-process">
<h2>Technology and Thought as Process<a class="headerlink" href="#technology-and-thought-as-process" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In recent years, the internet has become a place for the revealing of
thought as a process. On YouTube, for example, artists and other
performers have harnessed the power of video and social media for
expressing new ideas and finding new audiences. Bloggers have
established audiences over periods of time where they have gradually
been able to articulate their identity. Social media has provided new
means of connection, publication and discussion. In each case, the
‘products’ of thought published on social media are often partially
complete, and in their incompleteness they express uncertainties which
invite contributions from others. As audiences for blogs or YouTube
channels grow, the technology has afforded new mechanisms for
communication and status enhancement.</p>
<p>This technology tells us that an uncertain world requires not the
presentation of definite results and proof, but rather the articulation
and coordination of individual understanding or expression. In such an
environment, it becomes increasingly difficult to make distinctions
between knowledge and teaching, between the products of thought and its
process. Rather than the single objective description of the academic
paper, the multiple, and sometimes contradictory descriptions of
intellectual work represented in social media, open data, blogs,
open-source tools, and video may provide the richest means of
coordinating understanding and action between scientists, and address
the current misalignment between technology and epistemology. While
technology has increased uncertainty in the social environment of
institutions, the technological environment itself shows signs of
reorganising itself in a way that its uncertainty might be manageable in
the heterarchy of the internet.</p>
<p>Given these technological phenomena which exist outside universities,
the institution of education’s demarcation of boundaries between
teaching and research, openness and closedness, status and publication,
and between ‘thought as process’ and the ‘products of thought’ suggests
the kind of institutional response to uncertainty that was analysed in
earlier chapters. The institution of education creates its distinctions
to preserve its identity where university teaching practices protect the
institution’s status as gateway to knowledge and certification in the
face of technology’s abundance of learning opportunities. The question
is how to deal with uncertainty in scientific communication whereby
uncertainty itself can be communicated and scientists can engage in
dialogue with one another about contingent outcomes, theories and
possibilities. This question is necessarily a question about teaching as
a <em>revealing of understanding</em> which is equally a revealing of
uncertainty. Both require deep intersubjectivity in communication, where
multiple descriptions can be overlaid, but - as with the scientific
communication of the enlightenment - this intersubjective engagement
operates on a <em>massive</em> scale, and embraces the diversity of
descriptions made available through the scale of its operation.</p>
<p>The means of communicating science devised in the 17^th^ century
addressed the need for large-scale involvement of scientists from many
backgrounds. In the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(21^{st}\)</span> century, we have had an epistemological
transformation and explosion of available technologies of communication,
but the exploitation of those technologies for scientific communication
is relatively unexplored, where instead technology has been used in
scientific communication to reinforce the scarcity of the traditional
journal.</p>
<p>Outside the artistic community, the use by researchers of social media,
video, blogs, open e-learning tools, or contributions to email lists
remains constrained to a relatively small groups within academia. Yet
these activities, and many other innovative forms of scientific
communication and community engagement all provide rich descriptions
both of individual scientists themselves, and of their work. The
appreciation and development of ideas within social media is occurring
through the intersubjective engagement between scientists and the wider
community. These activities carry little status in the assessment of
intellectual contribution in the academy, just as the empirical work of
the members of the ‘invisible college’ carried little status in the
17^th^ century. Some changes to scientific communication are starting to
bear fruit: there have in recent years been calls for the publishing of
research data (rather than research papers) led by Tim Berners Lee’s
appeal for ‘Linked Data’[&#64;amit_semantic_2011], but as yet there is
little institutionally-oriented incentive for authors to do this.</p>
<p>It seems infeasible that the scientific world of the future can remain
tied to the practices of the 17^th^ century enlightenment. That these
practices have stuck around despite the explosion of possibilities for
scientific communication and the increasing requirement to articulate
uncertainty may have more to do with the structure of the institution of
science, than it does for any inherent merits of the journal system. The
organisational structure of science is torn between the necessity to
deal with increasing contingencies in results, with the desire to
maintain its form. The distinction between ‘thought as process’ and the
‘product of thought’ is at the heart of this dilemma. The ‘openness
agenda’ in education is a shift to a process-oriented approach to
scientific communication, for it is only this which can address the
requirement that uncertainties are communicated.</p>

<h2>Technology and Transactions<a class="headerlink" href="#technology-and-transactions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Both technology and institutions mediate transactions between people. In
both cases, this mediation is conducted against a background of trust
and risk. All technologies present risks [&#64;beck_risk_1992] where new
opportunities are accompanied by uncertainties which constrain society
in ways which produce emergent outcomes that cannot be anticipated.</p>
<p>Because of the uncertainties accompanying new technology, predictions
about its social impact are notoriously difficult. Approaches to
prediction vary from those which aggregate data on current trends and
attempt to identify patterns, projecting them onto the medium-term
future (eg. Gartner), to those approaches which analyse the deeper
underlying mechanisms and philosophical principles which underpin
today’s phenomena, and to draw out from those mechanisms the phenomena
which might present to us tomorrow. This latter ‘analytic’ approach is
more intellectually demanding, but there is some evidence that its
forecasting is more accurate.</p>
<p>An example of a successful analytical approach to technology prediction
is contained in Winograd and Flores’s book “Understanding computers and
cognition” [&#64;winograd_understanding_1986] which sought to identify the
underlying mechanisms which produced the technology of their time using
cybernetic analysis and philosophy. Their conclusion was strongly
critical of the prevailing understanding of technology in the
pre-internet age that computers were about data processing and
Artificial Intelligence (AI). Whilst the superficial appearances of
technology suggested that AI and data indicated the future, Winograd and
Flores’s analytical approach identified human communication as the
domain of fundamental transformation by computers in 1986, and which,
they argued, would continue to be changed in the future (this was before
the Worldwide Web)</p>
<p>Within a few years it became obvious that they were right. The
‘workflow’ technology which they pioneered on the back of their
philosophical and technological critique became one of the major
components of corporate IT communications infrastructure. Their argument
was that computers were both constructed <em>in langauge</em> and were tools
<em>of language</em> focused on the ‘speech acts’ which are performed through
computers (drawing on the Speech act theory of Austin and Searle).
Computers recorded speech acts, and through them the commitments which
human beings make to each other - those exchanges which are critical to
the establishment of trust between human beings - can be managed and
tracked, even to the point that eventually</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>New computer-based communication technology can help anticipate and
avoid breakdowns … we can partially anticipate situations where
breakdowns are likely to occur (by noting their recurrence) and we can
provide people with the tools and procedures they need to cope with
them. Moreover, new conversational networks can be designed that give
the organisation the ability to recognise and realise new
possibilities. [&#64;winograd_understanding_1986]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The fact that the computer kept a <em>record</em> of all the speech acts that
everyone made was for Winograd and Flores the critical issue. Curiously,
despite their anti-AI stance, this basic idea of storing and analysing
speech acts lies behind what we now consider to be the major
achievements of modern AI: social media on the internet provides the
‘big data’ from which data mining techniques identify precisely what
Winograd and Flores were articulating: ways of anticipating - and
potentially avoiding - breakdown.</p>
<p>Prescient though they were, the fundamental changes to the world in the
wake of the internet have thrown up issues which could not have been
foreseen in 1986. Adverse consequences of technological development
manifest themselves in various forms of dystopia which are not
dissimilar from the political anxieties which underpinned Winograd and
Flores’s critique of AI in the first place. Human language -
conversation - designs systems which are tools for language. Equally,
however, designed computer systems act as constraints on the utterances
humans make and the intentions that lie behind them. Winograd and
Flores’s view of computers helping to track speech acts was a kind of
transaction management system: they even created a state-transition
diagram to illustrate the effects of the different transactions made by
different individuals on the overall management process. Today, our
tools for communication are controlled by powerful corporations who
exploit the data we send with their services to make subtle
interventions in the communications infrastructure and shape our future
utterances - and, they hope, our purchasing behaviour.</p>
<p>In the transactional system envisaged by Winograd and Flores the medium
over which the transactions occur does not participate in the
communication. On today’s internet, people exchange speech acts with
each other, but the transactions are also made with the provider of the
communications platform who exploits the communications data in various
ways. In order to understand the complexity of this three-way
transaction model we need to understand more about transactions in
general and their relationship to institutions: both the transactions
which occur between people within an institution as speech acts
(promises, assertions, commissives, etc) and transactions which occur,
often without individuals’ knowledge, with corporations who provide
tools.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="transactions-and-institutions">
<h2>Transactions and Institutions<a class="headerlink" href="#transactions-and-institutions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The relationship between transactions and institutions was first studied
in the 1930s in the economic work of Ronald Coase[&#64;coase_firm_1990]. In
developing his theory, Coase argued that economics was upside-down. It
concentrated on the means for producing economic outcomes, but ignored
the social entities through which the means and ends of economics were
negotiated. Coase highlighted that there was in economics no questioning
about the existence of markets, banks, firms, governments and so on. His
suggestion was to see that social entities like markets were created
through the transactions which individuals made with them, and that
entrepreneurs created new markets by reorganising existing transactions:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>the operation of a market costs something and by forming an
organisation and allowing some authority (an “entrepreneur”) to direct
the resources, certain marketing costs are saved. The entrepreneur has
to carry out his function at less cost, taking into account the fact
that he may get factors of production at a lower price than the market
transactions which he supersedes, because it is always possible to
revert to the open market if he fails to do this. [&#64;coase_firm_1990
40]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The establishment of an institution like a market arose because the cost
of transactions between a seller and their customers could be reduced by
the entrepreneurial creation of an entity to broker exchange between
individuals. Coase goes on to discuss the role of technology in
facilitating transactions:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Inventions which tend to bring factors of production nearer together,
by lessening spatial distribution, tend to increase the size of the
firm. Changes like the telephone and the telegraph which tend to
reduce the cost of organising spatially will tend to increase the size
of the firm. [&#64;coase_firm_1990 46]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>New technologies are themselves the result of entrepreneurial firms,
reducing transaction costs for access to the means of reducing
transaction costs. It is in this corporate provision of services to
individuals who seek to reduce their transaction costs in other ways
that we find today’s internet giants.</p>
<p>Most of us make transactions in many different domains and engage with
many different kinds of institution. Over the internet and social
software, the way transactions are made, the kinds of organisations they
are made with, the way they are tracked and recorded has all been
transformed. According to Coase, and later the “New
Institutionalism”[&#64;powell_new_1991] theorists, whilst the human action
of transacting is constitutive of the institutions through which
transactions are exchanged, patterns of communicative transactions
across different industries can lead to dynamics whereby management
functions within institutions become coordinated in what DiMaggio and
Powell identify as ‘institutional isomorphism.’ The basic mechanisms of
transaction management have in various ways led to the specialised
discourses of what has generally been termed ‘managerialism.’</p>
<p><img alt="Transaction processing in online communicationplatforms" src="_images/socmed.jpg" />{#ref:socmed width=”\textwidth”}</p>
<p>The word ‘transaction’ implies some kind of exchange. In recent years,
with the demise of state-funded Higher Education in many countries,
education has entailed an explicit financial transaction between an
individual and a ‘provider.’ Education also involves other,
non-financial, transactions - the most obvious of which is the
completing of assignments in exchange for grades from a tutor, or the
gaining of a certificate at the end of a course. However as will be
discussed in chapter 10, exchange itself is poorly understood - even in
economics, where assumptions about exchange have been critiqued both
within mainstream economics [&#64;mises_human_2012; &#64;hayek_law_2012] and
sociology where ‘gifts’ are considered as forms of exchange
[&#64;mauss_gift:_2011; &#64;graeber_debt:_2013; &#64;bataille_accursed_1991]. There
are, therefore, different types of transaction evident in educational
processes. Alongside this, there are the transactions with the
corporations who provide technology platforms. Increasingly, the
transactions learners have with institutional learning systems are also
being harvested by institutional management as ‘learning analytics.’ On
social media, and through institutional platforms, learners consciously
participate in transactions with friends and others, whilst (perhaps
less consciously) learners also engage in transactions with social media
corporations and their universities.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-transactions-of-personal-learning">
<h2>The Transactions of Personal Learning<a class="headerlink" href="#the-transactions-of-personal-learning" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>University does not have exclusive control over the transactions of
learners or staff. Like everybody, learners and staff engage in many
transactions with many different kinds of institution and technology has
transformed the process of transaction management. Many technological
barriers to managing transactions have been removed, from online banking
to MOOCs. At the same time, these changes have led to emerging lock-in
to digital services, as more expensive face-to-face services are closed.
A balance has to be struck between the viability of organisations in
maintaining and managing sufficient transactions volumes to keep them
viable, with the increasing demand that individuals are steered towards
making those transactions in ways which carry least cost to
institutions. The balance is a delicate one of mutual needs: learners
depend on their engagements with institutions and corporations for
educational success, but equally institutions and corporations depend on
transactional engagements from individuals in order to maintain their
viability.</p>
<p>If effective learning involves balancing the different transactions that
individuals have with different institutions, what then becomes of the
viability of individuals in relation to that of the institutions with
whom they engage in transactions? On the one hand, concepts like
Bandura’s self-efficacy [&#64;bandura_self_1997] provide a way of thinking
about the degrees of resilience and flexibility which learners might
display in coordinating the different levels of transaction they have
with institutional services. On the other hand, those institutional
services depend on maintaining transactions with customers in order to
survive. The transactions of the individual must be seen in the context
of the transactions with the social environment.</p>
<p>For most of their history, the exchange of scholarly communications has
been facilitated through the university. Universities took their cut
from the scholarly transactions that passed through them, while
exploiting the quantity of transactions as a way of enhancing their
reputation in order to attract students and funding. Had there been
other ways of engaging in scholarly communications which avoided the
constraints imposed on them by the academy, then it is unlikely that
universities would have evolved in the way that they have. Today the
university is not the only way in which scholarly transactions can take
place. Communication over the internet is often much easier and has
fewer constraints than scholarly communication within the institution.</p>
<p>The internet is now the locus of a rich exchange of ideas: mailing
lists, media platforms, blogs and community groups act as a focus for
scholarly communication. Each of these platforms have their own
corporate forms. Some of them are provided by social media corporations,
and whilst the transactions occur between individuals who still act on
behalf of the institution they belong to, there is an additional
transaction with the platform provider. The providers of these
platforms, just like the operators of markets, depend for their
existence on the presence of transactions which pass through them.
Intense competition between social media platforms, and the associated
capital investments which need to be acquired to keep them growing and
innovating, mean that every social media platform seeks:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>to grow its user base;</p></li>
<li><p>to increase the number of transactions that each user of its service
makes.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cool-interactions">
<h2>Cool Interactions<a class="headerlink" href="#cool-interactions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Understanding the relationship between transactions and institutions
presents a perspective on the human relationship with social technology
which emphasises its political and economic rather than its
psychological dimension. The economics behind the ‘fun’ of new ‘cool’
technology drives continual innovation online. Every week, we see news
of some new technology that facilitates new forms of interaction: it
might be a new computer game, or some new service for translation (like
Google translate’s magical ability to automatically identify text in
images and translate it), or a new feature in SnapChat, or
voice-activated devices like Amazon’s echo, or Virtual reality, or a new
phone app. One of the exciting things about technology is that we
struggle to imagine what will become possible next year.</p>
<p>Having said this, every innovation is the same in the sense that every
innovation seeks to engage users in interaction. Without interaction,
without increased transactions, the innovation dies alongside its
corporate infrastructure. Moreover, most social media corporations are
now publicly-owned business empires with budgets exceeding those of many
nation states. The share prices of these corporations are highly
sensitive to the number of users and number of transactions exchanged
through the platform. It is only through the transactions with a
company’s services that the company exists. And it is only by harvesting
the data from those transactions that the company can make profits. The
online service company has to create the conditions for the exchange of
many transactions and use the intelligence it gathers from those
transactions to:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>provide targeted advertising services;</p></li>
<li><p>provide analytic services to other corporate clients;</p></li>
<li><p>steer user behaviour by constraining the information environment in
the platform in directions which favour corporate clients;</p></li>
<li><p>steer the userbase of the platform into new practices and services
which increase their engagement and broaden the network.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The commercial importance of these strategies is borne out by the
shifting market value of social media corporations. In 2016 Twitter
experienced a fall in its usage which had a significant effect on
Twitter’s share price[&#64;bbc_news_twitter_2016]. Equally, the opening
share price demanded by Snapchat was dependent on the number of
transactions which it produced [&#64;lee_snapchat_2017].</p>
<p>The physical manifestations of technological engagement - the creation
of new physical forms like smartphones, smart watches, voice activated
devices and virtual reality - have all served the purpose of driving up
the transaction count. Part of this has been a push towards smaller and
smaller transactions. So, for example, email tends to be a larger
transaction than a Snapchat message. With mobile accessibility, the
readiness-to-hand of mobile communication tools can be exploited as a
way of driving up increasing levels of engagement. The social phenomenon
whereby most individuals will now sit on trains staring at mobile
phones, either playing online games or reading and sending messages, is
the result of a situation where corporate machinery ever increasing
transactional engagement from users. In other words, what is seen to be
‘cool’ feeds the corporate survival instinct.</p>
<p>‘Cool’ tools increase the transaction count in ways which users are not
aware. This is particularly true of online gaming platforms, fitness
trackers, AI Bots and new technological experiences like Virtual
Reality. In these cases, tiny transactions of data feeds give
information about aspects of behaviour which users themselves are
unaware: the movement of the head and eyes in virtual reality, a
person’s heart rate, location information, particular phrases used by
people talking to a Bot, or learning processes as a game player solves a
puzzle. In each case, the data can be harvested. Since users are
increasingly operating within the defined constraints of online
platforms, the data can help adjust those constraints in particular ways
so as to steer behaviour. Machine learning can record patterns of
interaction and make inferences about behaviour to steer users towards
serving the needs of the corporations who provide the communications

<h2>The Transactions of Education<a class="headerlink" href="#the-transactions-of-education" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The impact of computers on most industries, from retail to finance, has
been an ever-increasing atomisation of transaction processing alongside
ever more sophisticated means of orchestrating different transaction
processing services. The components of this are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>the breaking-down of large transactions into many smaller ones;</p></li>
<li><p>the establishment of new businesses as additional services related
to atomised transaction processing;</p></li>
<li><p>maximising interoperability and sharing of data between different
service providers (and providing interoperability as a service
through ‘Application Programming Interfaces’ (API));</p></li>
<li><p>creating new ‘risks’ for customers to encourage the take-up of new
services (for example, new forms of insurance)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In the light of this, education appears as an anomaly in its use of
technology. Whilst computers dominate the educational landscape as much
as they do everywhere else, the institutional processes of teaching,
learning and assessment - each of which is transactional in its own way</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>has been largely untouched over hundreds of years. Learners are
recruited and taught in batch, they are assessed together in batch,
their progression from one module to another is coordinated in batch,
and they all graduate in fancy dress together.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The institution seeks to defend the status declarations it makes: how
does it defend the award of degree certificates? How does it defend its
position in society as a trusted authority worthy of public funding? How
does it convince students of the benefits of having a degree?</p>
<p>The answer to all of these questions is the maintenance of <em>trust</em> and
the manufacture of <em>risk</em>. By its nature, education concerns itself with
an unknowable future onto which the hopes and fears of individuals -
students, parents, employers and government ministers - are projected.
The University, like any corporate entity, has to maintain its role as
gateway through which people engage in transactions - in its case, for
learning and certification. To do this, its declaration of the scarcity
of knowledge and certification has to be believed, where despite the
many opportunities for learning outside the institution, it is only
through the portals of the institution that socially recognised and
trusted markers of individual status may be achieved.</p>
<p>The declaration of scarcity is upheld by processes of <em>quality
management</em>. It is in the quality machinery of the institution that the
resistance to the breaking-down of its transactions has been most
effective. ‘Quality’ processes in the institution, in fitting module and
programme specifications to a norm, have tended to have the effect of
reinforcing the institution’s assessment processes, and the standard
ways that students are taught and managed.</p>
<p>At the root of the quality process are the judgements of individuals.
The principal transaction which occurs in education is the assessment
transaction where an assignment is given to a learner in exchange for a
mark. The essential problem in this transaction is that its results are
variable. The mark depends, among many factors, on the teacher’s
expectation, the student’s understanding of those expectations and the
student’s ability. Despite many attempts to establish criteria for
making objective judgements, including the detailing of ‘learning
outcomes’ and ‘assessment criteria,’ this process is inevitably prone to
bias and variability. Amplified to an institutional level, variability
and bias would undermine trust in the institution’s proclamations.
Consequently, various bureaucratic processes are established to iron-out
bias in the system, including double (and sometimes triple) marking,
external examining, together with quality processes which attempt to
codify the form of regulatable modules with clearly established criteria
for assessment and learning. For each layer of quality, there are
lengthy transactional processes whereby different committees meet,
inspect documents, and pass agreed judgements between them. It is not
uncommon in this process that subtle distinctions about learning,
creativity and the merits of particular intellectual efforts are
homogenised into blanket judgements by the system. The price for
academic quality is attenuation of the space for distinction-making.</p>
<p>Technology has been exploited by the university to uphold this process.
From assessment management systems which automatically check student
work for plagiarism, to systems for managing the workflow as documents
are passed around from committee to committee, technology maintain the
unwieldy quality machine. The effect has generally been to remove the
space for discussion. The uncertainties over academic judgements are
increasingly ironed-out through statistical processing rather than
conversation. Exam boards, where tutors would meet to discuss the
results of their students, are increasingly turned into automatic
processes whereby student names are passed through the system with
codified outcomes for progression from one module to the next. In no
institution of higher education has the anomaly of the long transactions
of educational assessment and its associated long transactions of
quality management been addressed.</p>

<div class="section" id="technology-trust-and-experts">
<h2>Technology, Trust and Experts<a class="headerlink" href="#technology-trust-and-experts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Why has education been able to uphold and defend its traditional lengthy
transactions? Would it be trusted if did anything other than exercise
its cumbersome quality systems? The expectations of government about
what education should be, what it should look like, and the conduct of
‘good’ processes of teaching and learning necessitates the assessment of
one person by another person with expertise and good judgement.
Government itself participates in the quality system with inspection
regimes. The quality system is designed to mitigate the possibility of
variability of judgement, whilst putting pressure on those responsible
for assessing learners to do it according to the norm.</p>
<p>Trust in assessment and quality is not an absolute property. It is
emergent from the organisational challenges of evaluation within the
system. The fundamental organisational challenge of evaluation in terms
of grading a piece of work, finding an ‘expert’ to do it is the easiest
thing. It is not just why we have experts in the form of teachers
assessing students, but why we have medical experts assessing diagnostic
scans, or legal experts assessing court cases. The education system
makes it its business to manufacture experts, and so experts to make
judgements can be easily found.</p>
<p>The deeper question is, How might computers change the organisational
possibilities for assessment and status enhancement? Are there ways of
organising assessment which do not depend on a single expert’s
judgement? If this simple organisational challenge might be addressed
differently, what are the implications for the organisation of all the
other institutional mechanisms for maintaining trust in the system?
Recent years have seen remarkable technological developments in
employment which provide a clue as to the future impact of technology on
trust.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="trust-and-the-algorithm">
<h2>Trust and the Algorithm<a class="headerlink" href="#trust-and-the-algorithm" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The web has been used as a tool for the coordination of contracts
between buyers and sellers since the dot-com boom of the early 2000s.
The rapid growth of Amazon and other online stores depended on giving
customers the security that the exchange of financial details over the
web was as safe and reliable as the exchange of cash over the counter.
Developments in virtual payment technologies such as PayPal assisted in
building confidence among consumers that online transactions were
trustworthy. E-Bay coordinated the transactions between individuals,
providing guarantees for purchasers.</p>
<p>E-Bay’s coordination of contractual arrangements between individuals for
the provision of goods was a precursor to a much more radical
innovation: the coordination of contractual arrangements for the
provision of <em>services</em>. This is radical because, whilst goods can be
<em>described</em> on E-Bay or Amazon (and reviewed), services can only be
<em>experienced</em>. In order to purchase a service with confidence, buyers
must be assured that their expectations of the service will be met. With
technology to track service providers in real time, monitor reputations,
record highly accurate details of services provided, provide
communication channels for interaction between buyers and sellers,
companies like Uber and AirBnB shifted the focus of expectations of
buyers from trust in the assurances of taxi firms or hoteliers to the
detailed information provided by Uber’s and AirBnB’s technologies. This
faith in ‘the crowd’ has been copied in a variety of domains, from
health (e.g. PushDoctor), to dating (Tinder). In each case, online
actions have physical consequences: the constraints of the screen bear
upon the constraints of the real world.</p>
<p>The transactions between customers and service providers on Uber,
AirBnB, PushDoctor, Tinder are multi-way transactions. Whilst customers
may perceive the technology as providing a means by which a contractual
arrangement may be reached with an Uber driver (for example), the
transaction between the coordinating company, the driver, their
subsidiaries and so on is much more complex. In some cases, the
contractual arrangements between the individual and the corporation
which manages the technology can result in major consequences for
individuals. A careless and offensive tweet can land somebody in prison,
yet the damage that such a tweet may do to another individual (for
example, through ‘trolling’ them) is one dimension in a highly complex
range of transactional relations managed by a few simple technological
competencies.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-blockchain-threat-to-institutions">
<h2>The Blockchain Threat to Institutions<a class="headerlink" href="#the-blockchain-threat-to-institutions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The technology companies which have set themselves up as the brokers of
transactions between individuals are themselves vulnerable to attack
from technologies potentially offering the same kind of contractual
coordination between individuals <em>without</em> a broker. When brokered
service companies like Uber set themselves up as a globalised version of
what was a local company (the taxi firm), customer trust shifted from
the local company to the global firm with its ubiquitous app
technologies and local economies became global economies.</p>
<p>However, the critical question is whether customer trust was vested in
the global corporation (e.g. Uber), or whether it was vested in the app,
its algorithms and the reliability of the information it provided. The
issue is important because an app is conceivable which has no central
brokerage, but which instead coordinates transactions on a purely
peer-to-peer basis. This is basis of the technological coordination
which sits behind the virtual cryptocurrency BitCoin.</p>
<p>At the heart of the BitCoin algorithm is a kind of distributed database
technology, called <em>Blockchain</em>. Nakomoto’s paper which described the
operation of Blockchain detailed the specification of a “chain of
digital signatures” which would act as an open and transparent ledger of
transactions in the Bitcoin currency [&#64;nakamoto_bitcoin:_nodate]. The
idea was that a scarce digital asset could be created where the exchange
from one owner to another could be verified</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“by digitally signing a hash of the previous transaction and the
public key of the next owner and adding these to the end of the
coin”[&#64;nakamoto_bitcoin:_nodate]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The blockchain has two principal innovations which have ensured that the
ledger is trusted. Firstly, the entire blockchain - the list of all
transactions - is distributed and duplicated throughout the internet.
This massive redundancy means that any change to any particular copy of
the ledger must synchronise with all the other copies: there is no
central authority with the power to make changes. The copying process is
similar to the copying process behind the Domain-name server (DNS)
technology which underpins the world-wide web. Secondly, the veracity of
the blockchain ledger is assured by a process called ‘mining.’ This is a
data-intensive process which aims to identify any anomalies in the
ledger. Mining serves a dual purpose: whilst it ensures the ledger is
accurate, it also rewards those who find inconsistencies with the
creation of new Bitcoins, thus tying the mechanism of verification with
the control of the money supply (a function normally carried out by a
central bank).</p>
<p>Whilst Nakamoto saw the blockchain as a replacement for trust in third
parties like banks, arguing it was “an electronic payment system based
on cryptographic proof instead of trust” [&#64;vigna_cryptocurrency:_2016],
it can better be described as a means of establishing trust without an
institution to declare it. In banking, this is a revolution since the
value of all currency is effectively upheld by a ‘promise’ by a central
bank to redeem the value written on banknotes. This institutional
promise comes with a heavy bureaucratic burden: the trustworthiness of
the bank has to be upheld by codified procedures for regulating markets,
setting interest rates, controlling the money supply, economic
forecasting and so on. The overheads of a bank lie in its requirement to
maintain trust in itself. Blockchain has excited interest in
institutions beyond banking because the same ‘bureaucratic cost to
maintain institutional trust’ is true of law, education, health,
welfare, markets, transport, journalism and government.</p>
<p>By 2015, the technology underpinning the BitCoin phenomenon gained
mainstream attention with the publication of government reports into the
potential significance of technologies like Blockchain
[&#64;walport_distributed_2016]. The idea of a distributed ledger of
transactions as an object of trust became a focus of inquiry as to how
other institutions might be affected. Whilst as with all technical
innovations, the technology and the hyperbole are ill-matched, the genie
is out of the bottle: the internet is going to be become a ‘web of
trust,’ and the institutional structures which once saw their role in
assuring the public of their trustworthiness are unlikely to remain in
their current form.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="transactions-and-educational-assessment">
<h2>Transactions and Educational Assessment<a class="headerlink" href="#transactions-and-educational-assessment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Blockchain is a transactional technology, but one that is distributed
rather than centralised. Whilst institutions exist by virtue of the
transactions that individuals make with them, they also perform a
function that declares that transactions which do not occur through them
are illegitimate. The Bitcoin experience suggests that however much
banks may seek to denigrate them, cryptocurrencies remain viable (even
if they are volatile in their value). Educational institutions too seek
to claim that legitimate educational qualifications are only available
through their certification processes. Those certification processes
themselves rely on long, drawn-out transactions supported by cumbersome
and expensive mechanisms to uphold quality and maintain trust. Under
what circumstances might educational institutions find themselves
similarly challenged by a distributed transaction technology?</p>
<p>One of the reasons why transactions are made in the first place is the
environment of uncertainty. Education’s response to the uncertainties of
knowledge has been the establishment of credentials approved through the
judgement of student work by experts. These processes have the effect of
coordinating expectations between learners, teachers, employers and the
rest of society. Education’s management of expectation and its
establishment of trust is aimed at creating confidence among the
population in things which are inherently uncertain. Luhmann, whose work
focused on the coordination of expectation, writes of the importance of
this coordination of expectation that:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The normal case is that of confidence. You are confident that your
expectations will not be disappointed: that politicians will try to
avoid war, that cars will not break down or suddenly leave the street
and hit you on your Sunday afternoon walk. You cannot live without
forming expectations with respect to contingent events and you have to
neglect, more or less, the possibility of disappointment. You neglect
this because it is a very rare possibility, but also because you do
not know what else to do. The alternative is to live in a state of
permanent uncertainty and to withdraw expectations without having
anything with which to replace them. [&#64;luhmann_risk:_2005]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In dealing with emergent phenomena in their environment, institutions
have had to adapt. Technology has changed the environment within which
institutions operate, and in many cases, technologies provide new ways
of doing the things which institutions were set up to do. Although there
is a shift of trust from an institutional guarantee that expectations
will be met, to a technological guarantee, some fundamental barriers
within education to the replacement of institutional processes by
technological processes remains.</p>
<p>The reliance on experts for the award of qualifications, the gaining of
enhanced status and the assessment of work remains a critical barrier.
The institution’s organisation of assessment practice has concerned the
organisation of the making of trusted judgements by experts, and an
institutional quality process which defends those judgements. Are there
ways technology could replace expert judgement?</p>
<p><img alt="a) The transduction of expertise producing stable judgement; b) theproduction of stable ranking through comparative judgement withheterarchical organisation of non-experts" src="_images/acj.jpg" />{#ref:acj
width=”\textwidth”}</p>
<p>In Figure <a class="reference external" href="#ref:acj">7.2</a>{reference-type=”ref” reference=”ref:acj”}(a)
expertise can be thought of as a form of transduction in the
relationship between a community of experts and a set of objects. An
expert converts a highly complex set of information in the form of (for
example) student work, or medical scans, or legal cases, into a
judgement which is understood and agreed by other experts in their
community. Were an expert to produce judgements which were inconsistent
with the judements of other experts, that particular expert would not be
trusted. The trust arises from the consistency of the judgement.
Therefore the question about expertise is not about experts themselves,
but about the consistency of the judgements which result from their
action.</p>
<p>There have been attempts to reproduce reliable judgement through other
non-individual means. Crowd-sourcing judgement, for example, suggests
averages of judgements by large numbers of assessors (for example,
peers) can often prove to be <em>more</em> effective and reliable than the
expert opinion of an individual. Among the techniques for crowd-sourcing
assessment, Adaptive Comparative Judgement (ACJ) shown in Figure
<a class="reference external" href="#ref:acj">7.2</a>{reference-type=”ref” reference=”ref:acj”}(b) is a
pair-wise comparison technique of assessment in which individual judges
are asked to make a simple ‘low stakes’ judgement as to which of a pair
of examples of work is ‘better’[&#64;pollitt_method_2012]. The result of the
ACJ process is the production of a ranking from which grades can be
derived.</p>
<p>Each judgement using the ACJ system is a transaction between the judge
of the work and the judgement community. Not only is the work which is
judged subject to assessment, but so are the judgements by the judges
themselves. Consistency and variability against a norm can become
indicators of trustworthiness of the whole process. ACJ provides a
richness of transactional descriptions from which trust in the
objectivity of the result might be established. The implication of its
effectiveness is the potential to strip the assessment process from
institutions, and alongside it, to remove the need for quality
procedures, and the other paraphernalia of educational trust management.
If trusted mechanisms for learner progress can be shown to be more
flexible and believable than institutionally-certificated processes of
assessment, then the institutional model of assessment and quality
control are under threat. What should institutions do?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="universities-without-degrees">
<h2>Universities without Degrees<a class="headerlink" href="#universities-without-degrees" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The role of the university as the provider of certificates has fed into
positive-feedback mechanism which generates the need for more
certificates. But why should universities award degrees? If trusted
transactional processes of assessment can be conducted without the
institutional machinery of expert marking, quality mechanisms and so
forth, then the need for the institution to be conducting assessments at
all is called into question, which raises deeper existential questions
about the role of universities in society. In the future, technologies
may serve to coordinate individuals in addressing the challenges of
assessment and status without an institution, but there would remain
uncertainties which cannot be managed in this way.</p>
<p>This suggests a deeper role for universities in helping society to
manage its uncertainty. Universities coordinate a rich variety of social
relations through which conversations can help society steer itself and
its other institutions in an environment of high uncertainty. Dealing
with uncertainty has always been an important institutional function:
the monastery, for example, does this by providing a context for
reflection and prayer; laboratories provide a context for scientific
investigation and dialogue; hospitals provide a context for care and
treatment. Each institution is each others’ environment, and each exists
in an environment. Uncertainties arise both in the environment and
within the institution. Institutions, in order to survive, must actively
engage with and understand their environment, rather that make
assumptions about its nature (for example, the assumption that they
operate ‘in a market’). There is a critical moment in the development of
institutions where they cease to defend what they have always done in an
environment which becomes increasingly at odds with their processes. At
such a point a new contract is required with the environment (or
society).</p>
<p>Institutions evolve by successfully absorbing and adapting to
developments in their environment. Institutions get into trouble if they
lose touch with their environment. In managing the relationship between
themselves and technology and maintaining themselves for the future,
institutions have a role in ‘powering-up’ the environment so that its
underlying features and dynamics can be more clearly understood. Citizen
science, free courses, public lectures and online engagement all have a
role to play in activities which will blend learning with researching in
ways which are not currently possible within the constraints of the
curriculum. New transactional technologies promise more flexible ways of
coordinating learning conversations between a much wider variety of
stakeholders in society.</p>
<p>This is part of the university’s scientific mission. Nobody questions
the need to have biotechnology laboratories searching for cures for
diseases, or the need for engineering labs research future power
sources, or solutions to the threat posed by climate change. The
university’s study of its continually changing environment is however,
not currently something that is seen in the same light. Technology is a
fundamental component in this shifting environment, although
universities have tended to seek to use technology to maintain their
existing structures and practices. Yet understanding the environment is
a pre-requisite for the continued viability of all aspects of the
university’s scientific mission. Rather than seeking to maintain
existing structures and practices, universities could become:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Agents for the management society’s technological environment;</p></li>
<li><p>Upholders and developers of the discursive environment in which
individuals manage uncertainty;</p></li>
<li><p>Promoters of a science of dialogue and listening, where strength of
inquiry comes from the diversity of voices engaging in learning;</p></li>
<li><p>Providers of status enhancement for learners and staff through
supporting acts which declare new concepts, theories and
innovations;</p></li>
<li><p>Drivers of technological developments which increase the range of
descriptions available to learners as they engage in their learning;</p></li>
<li><p>Upholders of a political fora for debate about technologies and
their consequences;</p></li>
<li><p>Monitors of changes to the cultural ecology of society;</p></li>
<li><p>Drivers of convivial social organisation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Today’s universities deal in trusted symbols or tokens (degree
certificates), and they support themselves by charging for the
transactions by which such symbols are acquired. If technology could at
some point coordinate these transactions instead of institutions, then
the means by which institutions support themselves would have to change.</p>
<p>Giddens makes the point that symbols and tokens are only one aspect of
trust. Behind them lie many other deeper inter-human issues which are
unlikely to be addressed by technology, and which are fundamentally
concerned with human relationships:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>We can speak of trust in symbolic tokens or expert systems, but this
rests upon faith in the correctness of principles of which one is
ignorant, not upon faith in the “moral uprightness” (good intentions)
of others. Of course, trust in persons is always to some degree
relevant to faith in systems, but concerns their proper working rather
than their operation as such. [&#64;giddens_consequences_1991]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Building on this insight, Giddens suggests a definition of trust:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Trust may be defined as confidence in the reliability of a person or
system, regarding a given set of outcomes or events, where that
confidence expresses a faith in the probity or love of another, or in
the correctness of abstract principles (technical knowledge)</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The maintenance of privilege, control of access to certification or
declarations of the scarcity of knowledge are not critical functions of
the university. The technical changes which are currently underway
signal a transition to a ‘Web of Trust’ within which universities will
need to reposition their relationship with society. Given this, it
becomes important that universities prepare for this transition by
engaging in an inquiry about their environment and improving their
understanding of what is happening around them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion-a-web-of-trust">
<h2>Conclusion: A Web of Trust<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion-a-web-of-trust" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Giddens argues that trust wouldn’t be necessary if there weren’t
absences in the information from which we might make judgements:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Trust is related to absence in time and in space. There would be no
need to trust anyone whose activities were continually visible and
whose thought processes were transparent, or to trust any system whose
workings were wholly known and understood. [&#64;giddens_consequences_1991
33]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In reflecting on this, we might ask “What if activities were continually
visible and thought processes were transparent?”</p>
<p>This raises a more pertinent question about the role of language in
producing the patterns of trust and the institutional structures we
currently have. Language is an imperfect tool. If Shannon, Luhmann,
Bateson and others are correct, then communication occurs through a
process of making multiple descriptions, articulating meanings through
making various kinds of utterances which are processed in the minds of
others, resulting in reproduction of codes in society. In this process,
there is a necessary attenuation of complexity, and consequently, social
structures - like the structures of education - emerge to address the
resulting uncertainties.</p>
<p>What if we could communicate our uncertainty better? Would we need those
institutional structures to do the mopping-up which is left behind by
the deficiency of language?</p>
<p>The attraction of technologies like Blockchain and the transaction
brokerage of services like Uber is that they appear more transparent and
open than the ‘institutional guarantee of veracity.’ If individuals
could coordinate with one another directly in confidence and trust in
each others’ actions through technology then the dance of conversation
occurs at a deeper level unhindered by many of the
institutionally-created obstacles that face us today.</p>
<p>Having said this, universities play a fundamental role in the
coordination of scientific conversations. A science of uncertainty
demands a different kind of coordination between the institution and
society: the scientific discussion needs to involve a much larger group,
each member of which communicates their uncertainty. The engagement with
an ever larger community in scientific inquiry may necessitate smaller
transactions and could bring much greater flexibility to the way the
university coordinates its social and community relationships. Might the
university become a ‘subscription service?’ Might we see a continual
social relationship between the university and the citizenry for life?</p>
<p>The technological transformation of the media industry suggest this as a
possible model for the future. NetFlix, for example, began as a
subscription-based company whose transactions were conducted partly
online, and partly through the postal service. The delivery service’s
transactions were completely transformed with increasing broadband
speeds which made streaming viable. With consequent increases in scale,
NetFlix now challenges traditional media companies and national
broadcasters whose business models are beginning to look out of date.
While educational institutions have been able to uphold and defend their
traditional methods of handling transactions with students, the way
educational transactions are managed in the future is unlikely to be
untouched by emerging technology. The transformation of transaction
brokerage and management eventually has a fundamental effect on the
structure of all institutions and businesses. It may not be any of the
current decentralised technologies available today, but something a bit
like them will pose a challenge to underlying thinking about educational
attainment, status, expertise, trust and the institution’s relationship
to society.</p>

<h1><em><strong>Part 3</strong></em> Decision, Human Exchange and Higher Learning {#part-3-decision-human-exchange-and-higher-learning .unnumbered}<a class="headerlink" href="#part-3-decision-human-exchange-and-higher-learning-part-3-decision-human-exchange-and-higher-learning-unnumbered" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Part 3 considers the possibility of a ‘world as a university’ - a form
of global scientific organisation where the intelligence of every
individual contributes to the coordination of the viability of the
planet and its inhabitants. Is it possible, as Stafford Beer hoped, to
connect people together so that ‘many brains can think as one brain?’</p>
<p>Part 3 considers three dimensions to this question: ecological, economic
and intellectual. Chapter 8 begins by considering the consequences of
the many brains of humanity working for <em>themselves</em>. Our crises of
environment, economy and politics are all the result of decisions made
by an increasingly highly educated population, acting to control
problems whose complexity seems to overwhelm them. How can we understand
the problem of human decision so that more effective decisions can be
made? In what ways might technologies support this? In what ways might
they threaten it? The chapter points to work in ecology and
communication theory which suggests that new approaches to
decision-making require a deeper understanding of how diversity and
uncertainty is managed in nature and society.</p>
<p>Of the many constraints which impinge upon human decision-making, money,
markets and personal security have a significant impact on individual
motivations, and on the extent to which individuals will act for the
common good. Chapter 9 examines human actions of ‘exchange’: both the
exchange of things like education for money, and the presentation of
things to others as gifts. The current marketisation of education, which
is itself a response to managing uncertainty, reflects the dominance of
the discipline economics within the academy. It is argued that this
discipline is subject to discursive operations within the institution,
and that a more open and generous discourse around uncertainty and
science can invert the relation between the academy and economics. The
economics of exchange, and with it the financialisation of education, is
seen as an approach to managing uncertainty. Yet in education, this must
be balanced with an approach to generosity and giving. This requirement
to balance these two approaches to managing uncertainty is presented
Using a cybernetic model, which suggests that an educational
‘meta-economics’ is necessary for their coordination.</p>
<p>The intellectual aspect of a ‘world as a university’ asks what society
wishes for from university in the form of ‘higher learning.’ Is it
simply the learning of more difficult stuff than school? Is it the
gaining of skills for high-paying employment? Is it personal
transformation? Is it creativity? Chapter 10 considers ‘higher learning’
in the context of the need to manage uncertainty and acquire personal
security. This entails a consideration of educational development from
childhood to maturity, from the relations between parents and babies to
the relations between scholars and work colleagues, from relations
between children and objects such as toys and dolls, to the dynamic
generation of new concepts, artefacts and social relations in adult
life. Cybernetic thinking, drawing on work from psychology, is used to
make a case that the intellectual journey towards a ‘world as a
university’ is the increasing effectiveness of the balance between the
management of uncertainties within the self, and of uncertainties in the
environment.</p>

<p>The manifest destruction of our environment results from human decision.
Either at an individual level, or at the level of corporations,
governing bodies, ministerial agencies, political conferences,
international agreements or pressure groups, people come together to

will turn a blind eye to the damage they cause in the name of profit,
while others may seek to mitigate damage by making better decisions -
often by attempting to limit the decisions of others. The end result is
that damage persists upheld by webs of institutions, including
universities, each seeking to uphold their identity and mission.
Education plays its role: students emerge from university as
stockbrokers, industrialists, bankers, ecologists, engineers and
artists, and everyone emerges as a ‘consumer.’</p>
<p>Decisions are made within constraints. There are the immediate
constraints which include the available information about the situation,
its accuracy, the skills and capabilities of individuals, their
psychological state, the technological resources available, and
communication channels for coordinating action. There are also more
subtle constraints including power relations within the decision-making
group and the broader political background of decision-making. These in
turn depend on the information we have about others - both those with
whom decisions are made and those who are directly affected by
decisions. Decisions are made in an inter-subjective context, even when
they are the decisions by an individual for their own needs. For
example, prospective students faced with choosing a subject or an
institution must deal with multiple constraints, including information
about judgements by others as to their suitability to a particular
course, information about career prospects, information about
alternatives, information about costs, as well as self-evaluation of
desires, uncertainties, commitment and motivation.</p>
<p>The example of the prospective student illustrates the problem. If we
are to draw the dynamics of uncertainty surrounding the student’s
decision-making process, then we might say that if a student’s goal is
to realise a future version of themselves, then society presents ways in
which that uncertainty can be managed through ‘categories of possible
actions’ - the names of subjects, courses, institutions, potential
careers, and so on. Technology has transformed this uncertain situation
by expanding the possibilities for ‘categories of possible action’ -
they now include online courses, specific industrial technologies for
which one might become self-taught, various forms of work-integrated
learning and apprenticeship. Technology has also transformed the
professional domain producing (in some cases at least) greater
flexibility of work alongside employment insecurity. In all cases where
decisions must be made, the quandary is that difficult in deciding is
increased by the range of technological choices available for acting,
where those technologies themselves are responsible for the uncertainty.</p>
<p>For each way in which society produces the means of managing the
uncertainty of decisions, new information is generated. In decisions
about the environment, for example, there is new information about the
environment, about decision problems, about threats, about the economy,
about others and their intentions and about the future. Because each
constraint on decision manifests as information, it is helpful for
analysis to say simply that <em>decisions are constrained by information</em>,
and that <em>deciding</em> entails the production of further information.</p>
<p>Information is recursive: graphs and spreadsheets, rumours, computer
models and simulations are all themselves the product of conversations
at a different level of recursion. Within each dimension are multiple
distinctions and descriptions, and each level of distinction produces
information about itself. Seen from this perspective, the predominant
concerns expressed so far in this book come together in the relationship
between information and decision: distinction-making, intersubjectivity,
conversation, technology and institutional organisation all manifest
themselves in decision in the end.</p>

<h2>Garbage cans and Paradoxes<a class="headerlink" href="#garbage-cans-and-paradoxes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are few decisions for which ‘complete information’ about the
situation is at hand. The decision-making process produces as its
outcome a choice of one thing or another, but in order to make that
choice, the uncertainties of the problem have to be managed. The
strategies for managing the uncertainties of the decision-making process
are an essential part of the decision-making process. Uncertainties
reveal themselves in the intersubjective engagement among stakeholders,
in the constraints which are revealed to block access to critical
information, in the unknowable consequences of particular actions or the
possibilities presented by new technologies. Decision-makers must
balance their uncertainty about each other with the uncertainties
relating to the problem.</p>
<p>There are many theories of decision, among which some have a heritage in
systems thinking. Those theories which deal with the problem of
complexity and uncertainty have to somehow address the problem of
rationality. As Rittel argued, humans are faced with ‘wicked problems’
[&#64;rittel_dilemmas_1973] which are ill-defined, and present no coherent
solution. Faced with these, we can ask ‘What is reasoned action?’</p>
<p>Systems-oriented approaches to this question focus on the paradoxes
faced by decision-makers operating in conditions of imperfect
information. Cohen and March’s ‘Garbage can model of organisational
decision-making’ [&#64;cohen_garbage_1972] saw decision-makers explictly
avoid ‘wicked problems’ and instead seek easier problems for which
solutions could be found. Nigel Howard’s ‘Paradoxes of
Rationality’[&#64;howard_paradoxes_1971] and its development into what
became known as ‘drama theory’ used game theory analysis to argue that
no rational outcome was possible, but it was possible for
decision-makers to identify what Howard called ‘meta-rationality.’</p>
<p>Cohen and March created a systems-oriented view to organisational
decision- making in 1972 which they presented as a systems-dynamic
model. They used the metaphor of the ‘garbage can’ to describe a process
[&#64;cohen_garbage_1972] which they observed operating in the boardrooms of
their University. In observing that committee decision-making often
attenuates the uncertainty of real problems by overlooking the difficult
problem and instead addressing a problem that can be solved with tools
already available, they used the metaphor of committee members
‘rummaging around’ the garbage can of existing solutions to easier
problems in order to agree a plan of action. This attentuation of
uncertainty has the virtue of producing a coordination between the
expectations of the members of the committee but leaves the underlying
problem untouched (and indeed, may even exacerbate it).</p>
<p>The group dynamics of the ‘garbage can’ help to explain how it is that
important and difficult problems in education such as the retention of
students, the learning experience, student employability or plagiarism
attract technological ‘solutions’ which often don’t solve the problem,
but instead become proxies for dealing with the symptoms. As a result,
the software portfolio of the institution increases: plagiarism checking
software, attendance monitoring software, lecture evaluation software or
customer relations management software are all pulled out of the
‘garbage can’ but do little to address the underlying causes. Meanwhile,
institutional decision makers solve the specific problem of how to look
as if they have taken decisive action.</p>
<p>When faced with fundamental questions as to the content of educational
programmes, similar dynamics can be seen. The University’s internal
decision-making is geared towards the reproduction of existing
categories such as ‘modules,’ ‘assessment criteria’, ‘credits’ with
which any new course offering must negotiate. These decision-making
processes are part of the institution’s processes of maintaining the
distinctions it makes about itself. Even when it is apparent that a
particular curriculum is out of date or not working and requires review,
the existing categories the institution and its decision-making
processes bear upon any attempt at radical transformation ensuring that
what emerges is little different from what went before.</p>
<p>The apparent conservativism of these processes derives not only from an
individual institution. Institutions exist in the context of other
institutions, national guidelines and student expectations. The
generation of standard categories for course offerings is an attenuator
of the uncertainties of course design within the institution, but it is
also an attenuator of the uncertainties of life choices faced by the
student. This means that the metasystem of the institution, which uses
these categories to manage its internal uncertainty is connected to the
metasystem of the student who seeks to manage their uncertainty about
choices for the future. Diagrammatically, this can be shown using the
diagram introduced in chapter 5 which connects one metasystem’s
categories with another.</p>
<p><img alt="The symbiotic relationship between the uncertainty management of theindividual and the uncertainty management by theinstitution" src="_images/opportunity.jpg" />{#ref:studentinst width=”\textwidth”}</p>
<p>Cohen and March describe organisational decision-making as a collective
response to the unfathomable complexity of real problems. The dilemma
for decision-makers is to find a compromise between the complexity of
the problem to be solved, and their own problem in being seen to take
action as ‘decision-makers.’ In economics decisions are often analysed
in terms of the ‘games’ presenting options that derived from John von
Neumann’s ‘game theory.’ Game theory considers that human beings make
decisions by weighing up the pros and cons of the different options they
have for acting. However, one problem with this approach is that it can
become impossible to determine which option is preferable, particularly
in situations where there must be cooperation between a number of
different people. Cohen and March describe a situation where the
decision is taken to ‘play a different game’: that to change the game to
one in which an option can be found. The process of moving from a game
in which a decision cannot be made to a game about the game in which a
decision is possible is called a metagame. Howard developed the basic
idea of game theory by arguing that humans were not rational but could
be metarational, and he later called this ‘drama theory.’</p>
<p>Drama theory concerns everyday situations where human action does not
appear to be rational. Instead of making the cool rational judgements
about situations, individuals become stressed, emotional and impulsive.
In a heightened emotional state, they play a different game. Such
situations present themselves regularly in the plays of Shakespeare, and
Howard’s theory was an attempt to reason about the <em>metarationality</em> of
the choices made in difficult situations [&#64;howard_paradoxes_1971].
Howard argues that decisions often arise out of crisis, or what he calls
‘paradoxes of rationality.’ The first paradox concerns the situation
where the rational move in a game yield a worse outcome than an
apparently irrational move.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="are-we-doomed">
<h2>Are we doomed?<a class="headerlink" href="#are-we-doomed" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Both the garbage can model and Howard’s metagames explain what seems to
happen in the boardrooms of corporations, universities and governments,
but it raises a worrying problem: if the dilemmas of decision-makers
lead them to play a metagame and make decisions to implement
technologies which do not address fundamental problems, then the
underlying problems of society go unaddressed as well as new problems
being introduced through the new tools. Doesn’t this then simply feed
the problems which board meetings seek to address? How is it possible to
escape the pathologies of organisational decision? How can the many
brains involved in organisational decision-making work as one single
brain focusing on the important problems that need to be solved?</p>
<p>Tools increase uncertainty by increasing the options for acting, but
they also help to manage uncertainty through attenuation and
amplification. The attenuation of uncertainty stems from the possibility
that a tool might be selected which transforms difficult problems into
simple problems. Howard understood that the perception of a problem as
being difficult is partly a function of the metasystem within the
individual, and this individual uncertainty stems further from the
individual’s perception of their place in a social structure and the
imagined implications of failing to make a decision. Organisational
decision-making becomes a search for powerful tools that attenuate
external uncertainty because of internal uncertainty of the individual’s
metasystem. The tool that is selected becomes part of the individual’s
metasystem as a way of managing their internal uncertainty. But what if
an alternative way was found whereby individuals involved in
decision-making processes could articulate their uncertainty more
clearly, become more aware of each other, and coordinate their
uncertainty together as an approach to decision-making?</p>
<p>Ivan Illich identified what he called ‘convivial tools’ which were
limited to performing a simple function that required people to work in
concert together. Illich argued that the use of such tools could
contribute to the creation of a ‘convivial society’ which should:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“allow all its members the most autonomous action by means of tools
least controlled by others. People feel joy, as opposed to mere
pleasure, to the extent that their activities are creative”
[&#64;illich_tools_2001 33]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>For Illich, the problem of tooling and decision was that tools had
become too powerful: human beings no longer operated in a world at a
human scale, and consequently found that they could not engage with one
another on a human level. In focusing of the conviviality of simple
tools, Illich uses cybernetic language where, for example, the scythe
was a “mere transducer[s] of the energy generated by man’s extremities
and fed by the intake of air and of nourishment.”[&#64;illich_tools_2001].
In Illich’s interpretation, the selection of the tool from Cohen and
March’s ‘garbage can’ was a problem not because it evaded the addressing
of important questions (although this it does), but because the tools
selected are so powerful that they create a barrier between people: the
use and control of such tools is handed over to experts. In this vein,
Illich sees ‘tools’ in a broad way, focusing not only on instruments
like “drills, pots and syringes,” but also on “productive institutions
such as factories that produce tangible commodities like corn flakes or
electric current, and productive systems for intangible commodities such
as those which produce “education”.” Illich’s identification of a
connection between conviviality and tooling provides a framework for
rethinking society and decision.</p>
<p>Illich charts the effect of the increase in the power of tools in
society, and the consequent loss of conviviality. The process is one
which connects the concept of conviviality with that of <em>knowledge</em>,
<em>information</em> and artificial scarcity:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“In limited and well-integrated tribes, knowledge is shared quite
equally among most members. All people know most of what everybody
knows. On a higher level of civilization, new tools are introduced;
more people know more things, but not all know how to execute them
equally well. Mastery of skill does not yet imply a monopoly of
understanding. One can understand fully what a goldsmith does without
being one oneself. Men do not have to be cooks to know how to prepare
food. This combination of widely shared information and competence for
using it is characteristic of a society in which convivial tools
prevail.” [&#64;illich_tools_2001]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Through the need for ‘widely shared information and competence,’ Illich
connects his concerns for the convivial tools of the goldsmith with the
availability of information as to what it is the goldsmith does. This
availability of information is threatened as the institutional
structures which disseminate information - education - declare it to be
scarce. By contrast, he sees in modern tools declarations of scarcity of
information and skill as to how to operate them:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“When centralization and specialization grow beyond a certain point,
they require highly programmed operators and clients. More of what
each man must know is due to what another man has designed and has the
power to force on him. The city child is born into an environment made
up of systems that have a different meaning for their designers than
for their clients.” [&#64;illich_tools_2001]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This process of scarcity-production in society typifies the tools which
amass in the ‘garbage can’ of institutional decisions. Tools of
excessive power which require specialised operators are developed and
promise to <em>fix</em> societal problems, and attract decision-makers with
easy ‘wins’ for dealing with difficult problems. For example, the
university with a student ‘employability’ problem seeks a solution in a
Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system; the university with a
student retention problem seeks a solution in the technologies of the
‘learning analytics’ panopticon.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ecology">
<h2>Ecology<a class="headerlink" href="#ecology" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Illich was one of the early champions of the study of the ecological
connections between the different aspects of society and technology,
arguing for a broadening of the concept of ecology to embrace the
political domain. ‘Political ecology,’ as he called it, involved among
other things, the politicising of decisions about technology. He saw the
process of engagement with tools, the widely-shared information and
competence for using tools, and the ‘autonomous action by means of
tools’ as the essential components of a dialogical process whereby a
convivial society could not only harness the full potential of their
tools, but participate in the decisions as to which tools should be
developed or limited in which ways. At the heart of Illich’s convivial
society is the belief that development of tools beyond the scale of
human society was a pathological process set in motion by the
declaration of scarcity.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“Ecology, during the last ten years, has acquired a new meaning. It is
still the name for a branch of professional biology, but the term now
increasingly serves as the label under which a broad, politically
organized general public analyzes and influences technical decisions.
I want to focus on the new electronic management devices as a
technical change of the human environment which, to be benign, must
remain under political (and not exclusively expert) control.”
[&#64;illich_silence_1983]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Illich’s demand for political control of technology is echoed in a
similar (later) call by Feenberg, who argues for “Democratic
rationalisation”:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>In the future, those who today are subordinated to technology’s
rhythms and demands may be able to control it and determine its
evolution. I call the process of creating such a society “democratic
rationalisation” because it requires technological advances imposed by
wide public participation in technical decision making
[&#64;feenberg_between_2010]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The democratic deficit of technology is highlighted by Beck, who simply
states that “Technological change is legitimated social change without
political legitimation”[&#64;beck_risk_1992]. Illich’s point is not simply
that technological development should be provided with political
legitimacy. It is rather that technologically-engaged political
processes should serve to shape the ways tools develop in society.</p>
<p>The convivial society would limit of the power of technology through
political discourse as to what tools ought to be created and for what
purpose: his polemic against institutionalised health, education,
transport and work was against institutional forms which find themselves
caught in a positive feedback-loop, reacting to environmental
uncertainty by producing ever-increasing domination over individual
lives. It was an inflationary process of creation and reinforcement of
<em>regimes of scarcity</em>, which in turn produced professionalisation,
certification, and institutionalised education and health systems.</p>
<p>Beck [&#64;beck_risk_1992] elaborates on Illich’s thesis. He too is
particularly aware of the pathology of the institution of education as
an ‘over-powerful’ tool. He writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Everywhere educational reform is accompanied by a dependence on
education. More and more groups get caught up in the race for
educational credentials. As a result there emerge new internal
differentiations. Whilst these may still respond to traditional
differences between groups, the impact of education makes them
fundamentally different from traditional ones. […] In conjunction
with novel patterns of upward and downward mobility and increasing
local labour mobility as well, new hierarchies and differentiations
develop which are internal to social classes. They presuppose the
expansion of the service sector and the creation of new occupations.
[&#64;beck_risk_1992]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In what way might a balance be struck between the organisation and
coordination of institutions, the appropriate limiting of technologies,
and the maintenance of a society within which lives may be lived within
a human scale? As increasingly powerful tools dominate social life, the
fundamental political challenge is to maintain a grasp of the coherent
‘whole system.’ Here Beer’s work on the topology of ‘whole systems’
complements Illich’s point about living within a human scale and
limiting technology: as was discussed in chapter 5, Homo Faber will
always build ever more powerful tools; but what Beer called ‘Homo
Gubernator’ (steering, or governing man) was required to ensure that
society’s metasystem did not lead to the positive feedback loop of
increasingly unmanageable uncertainty described in chapter 4. Beer
argued that a ‘metalanguage of organisation’ in society’s metasystem was
an essential component in the construction of a viable world. In other
words, what was required was a ‘systems ecology’ which addressed the
problem of effective organisation in an environment of uncertainty.</p>

<h2>Systems Ecology and Regimes of Scarcity<a class="headerlink" href="#systems-ecology-and-regimes-of-scarcity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The ecological movement arose through a cybernetic intervention. James
Lovelock’s identification of the synergistic relationship between
atmosphere and planetary life (the Gaia hypothesis) depended on basic
cybernetic concepts of feedback, regulation and self-organisation
[&#64;lovelock_gaia:_2016]. Illich is not alone in identifying the social
and epistemological dimensions to this system. Bateson, in attempting to
articulate an ‘ecology of mind’ was precisely aiming at the root of the
ecological crisis: it lay in the decisions of human beings taken in the
light of what he considered to be faulty reasoning.</p>
<p>The nature of the reasoning processes and the technological context
within which reasoning occurs are all varieties of constraint which bear
upon decision. Illich recognises that it is not enough to simply tell
people that they have a faulty epistemology (most institutional leaders
are well-defended against any criticism that their world-view might be
wrong). The very mechanisms by which epistemologies are acquired must be
tackled: not simply in the messages they convey, but in how they
themselves are organised. Merely by virtue of their organisation,
schools and universities declare the scarcity of knowledge even to those
who never set foot in them.</p>
<p>Illich painted a rich picture of the continually shifting constellations
of limiting forces on thought and action. When he speaks of ‘Political
Ecologies,’ he is concerned with the interconnections between human
needs, their tools, and the environment. The pathology that leads to
over-powerful tools and over-bearing institutions is one where increases
in power result from declaring the scarcity of knowledge and the
separation of the function of a tool from other elements in society. The
attenuation of uncertainties produced by tools is partly achieved
through the translation of differences between human needs and tools in
terms of market value. Institutions, including markets, universities,
churches, banks and the post-office are tools for managing uncertainty.
Another way of expressing this is to say they ‘codify expectations’
among those who engage with them.</p>
<p>Society has always generated institutional mechanisms for managing
uncertainty: family, the church, the law, and government all perform
this function. More recently we have seen the welfare state, mass
education, universal healthcare and the organisation of public
utilities. Institutional structures have been adjusted continually in
response to availability of resources, changing political circumstances,
changes in technology and changes to the environment. The major
institutions of health, welfare and education have seen dramatic
re-engineering (and in some cases dismantling) since the 1980s. These
processes have not been a move towards more effective ways of managing
uncertainty. Instead, there has been a process of heightened scarcity
production: since the 1980s technologies created new uncertainties to
which existing institutional structures adapted by defending themselves,
and which in the process created more uncertainty. Part of the increase
in uncertainty has resulted from the information explosion produced by
technology. Each of us now swims in an ‘information environment.’ How is
it that an information environment should make us more uncertain?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="information-and-environment">
<h2>Information and Environment<a class="headerlink" href="#information-and-environment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The word ‘information’ is used in many contexts and arguments continue
at the forefront of physics, biology, theology and technology with
regard to a coherent meaning of the word [&#64;davies_information_2014].
There is some consensus that information can be considered as
<em>constraint</em> [&#64;deacon_incomplete_2012] and this has implications on the
way we think about the relationship between technology and human
organisation. For example, the predominance of information in the
environment leads Floridi to talk of the <em>ethics</em> of information as an
<em>environmental</em> ethics [&#64;floridi_ethics_2015]. The information produced
by every institution, company and individual constitutes a shared
environment within which every other institution is part, just as each
organ of the body is part of the environment of every other organ. This
information conveys distinctions about the identity of each component.
The result is that the different components within an environment exist
in an informational relationship to one another in a similar manner to
different components in an ecosystem.</p>
<p>The measurement of ecosystem diversity has been attempted by a number of
ecological researchers since the 1950s. Odum’s <em>Fundamentals of Ecology</em>
was published in 1953 beginning an extensive line of research into the
way that information theory could be used to explore the diversity of
ecosystems. These approaches have been developed over the years, most
recently in the work of Robert Ulanowicz
[&#64;ulanowicz_information_2001; &#64;ulanowicz_reckoning_2014]. In Ulanowicz’s
work, the diversity of the ecosystem is empirically measured in terms of
the relationship between the different components which make up the
system. These relationships are measured according to the information
which is exchanged them: more specifically, Ulanowicz is interested in
what Shannon [&#64;shannon_mathematical_1949] calls the <em>mutual information</em>
between the components of the system.</p>
<p>In a biological ecosystem, organisms convey information in their
respiration, excretions, feeding and habitat. The overall life of an
ecosystem can be measured by the total throughput of events between all
the components. Each event from component <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a\)</span> to component <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b\)</span> either
share patterns in their surprisingness or they don’t. In Shannon’s
terminology, this means that entropy is either high (very surprising) or
low. If the entropy of one system aligns closely with the entropy of
another, then there is high mutual information between them. Such a
closely-coupled biological system is one where if one part of the
systems dies, the other part dies too. Ulanowicz argues that mutual
information can be seen as an index of the ecosystem’s development.</p>
<p>In systems with a high degree of mutual information, there is a low
amount of flexibility because there is a tight degree of coupling
between the information one system produces and the information the
other system produces: it is a relation of mutual dependency (see Figure
<a class="reference external" href="#ref:ulan1">8.2</a>{reference-type=”ref” reference=”ref:ulan1”}(a)). By
contast, in systems with low amounts of mutual information, there is a
higher degree of capacity for adaptation, but this is accompanied by a
lower level of system cohesion: systems produce complementary
information independently, but their relation to one another is loose.
This is shown in Figure <a class="reference external" href="#ref:ulan1">8.2</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”ref:ulan1”}(b). The balance between the two extremes can be
seen as the optimal conditions for ecological development (Figure
<a class="reference external" href="#ref:ulan1">8.2</a>{reference-type=”ref” reference=”ref:ulan1”}(c)):</p>
<p><img alt="Ulanowicz's statistical ecological model of rigidity andflexibility" src="_images/ulan1.jpg" />{#ref:ulan1 width=”\textwidth”}</p>
<p>These statistical measurements of ecological viability can help in the
decision-making processes of managing a fishery or a forest. They supply
a means by which the complexity of the system can be assessed, grounded
in a fundamental theory, and used to monitor the effects of different
interventions. If bad decisions are made with regard to the management
of an ecosystem, then the impact of those decisions is observable in the
loss of population and variety of species. Techniques like this provide
the foundation for discussion at a metasystemic level, where theory,
empirical evidence and practice can be brought together in discourse.</p>
<p>Ulanowicz’s analysis provides an empirical basis for understanding
growth in living systems. For example, in the information flows between
components in an ecosystem, new elements in the system can supplant
existing elements where the system can develop its structure as shown in
Figure <a class="reference external" href="#ref:ulan2a">8.3</a>{reference-type=”ref” reference=”ref:ulan2a”}.
It is striking that these patterns of growth are not only applicable to
the growth of ecosystems, but more deeply to the organic growth of a
discourse, a piece of music, or even a learning conversation:</p>
<p><img alt="Growth of an ecosystem with the replacement of component D withE" src="_images/ulan2a.jpg" />{#ref:ulan2a width=”\textwidth”}</p>
<p>While Ulanowicz’s measurements produce a network of relations, and he
has shown how different networks of relations reflect the viability of
particular ecosystems, it is also important to note that this
statistical analysis is an attenuation of complexity. What makes it more
powerful than superficial statistical measurements is the relationship
to theory: Ulanowicz’s measurements are derived from a sophisticated
theoretical model which predicts possible phenomena in the environment.
The scientific work of the metasystem has to negotiate the difference
between what is predicted and what is observed. The result of this
process is then to consider what about the theory is reliable or not, as
well as what in the system may require intervention.</p>
<p>In a social system like education, the ecosystem dynamics of information
are such that the processes of measurement of system dynamics themselves
produce information which becomes part of the ecosystem. Indeed, the
effect of performance indicators, targets and other metrics produce
higher degrees of mutual information in the system, but with a
consequent loss of flexibility. For example, techniques associated with
‘learning analytics’ are often blind to the effects of measurement in
injecting further information into the ecosystem dynamics of education.
The significance of Ulanowicz’s work is not that measurement and
analysis can guide management; it is that theoretical modelling,
empirical practice and operational interventions can be combined in an
effective metasystemic operation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="education-s-ecosystem">
<h2>Education’s Ecosystem<a class="headerlink" href="#education-s-ecosystem" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Is education an information system which exhibits similar ecological
properties to those studied by Ulanowicz? It is not difficult to see the
observable information that scholars produce: there are, after all,
academic papers, citations, projects, conferences and so on. However,
there are deeper problems in an ecology like education than appear to be
presented in biology. For example,</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>the measurement of information in metrics produces new information
in the ecology which has knock-on consequences;</p></li>
<li><p>performance metrics are often generated without a grounding in
theory, and so there is little way of evaluating what is predicted
with what is observed, and whether a particular theory is a good one
or not;</p></li>
<li><p>the signs of real systemic failure can be masked by information
produced by metrics which indicate all is well;</p></li>
<li><p>algorithmic calculations producing information can take the form of
what O’Neil calls ‘opinions expressed in code’
[&#64;oneil_weapons_2017];</p></li>
<li><p>metrics are used as a tool for attenuating uncertainty in the system
which in turn increases uncertainty.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Having said this, techniques for measuring the information dynamics of
the educational ecosystem can be revealing. Shannon’s concept of mutual
information, exploited by Ulanowicz, can also be applied to the analysis
of a scientific discourse. Leydesdorff has used techniques similar to
Ulanowicz to study the academic literature focusing analysis on the
occurrence of words in research
papers[&#64;leydesdorff_knowledge-based_2006; &#64;leydesdorff_interaction_2009].
Like Ulanowicz, Leydesdorff focuses on the mutual information in the
system as an indicator of its coherence. In situations where, over time,
the mutual information across discourses increases, Leydesdorff argues
that this can be used as an indicator of innovation activity in
economies. Of particular importance, he argues that coherence between
government, industry and academia is essential for vibrant economic
development. This means that the institutions of government,
universities and industry have a shared stake in the management of
uncertainty in their coordination of information between them.</p>
<p>Work on social systems raises complex questions which are not as
immediate in biology. Social theory must be included within the
information-theoretical analysis. Drawing on the sociological cybernetic
theory of Niklas Luhmann [&#64;luhmann_social_1996], Leydesdorff presents an
analytical framework aimed at identifying the patterns of coordination
of understanding among scholars as reflexive agents operating in a
dynamic (and uncertain) environment. This means that information
produced as utterances in documents must be selected through reflexive
processes, and those reflexive processes have some relation to the
meaning which lies behind the utterances. Leydesdorff’s argument is to
say, with Luhmann, that social systems like education are ‘meaning
processing systems,’ where meaning can be studied as the ‘negative
image’ behind the dynamics of observable information.</p>
<p>The deeper problems of an information ecology, where analysis produces
more information which contributes to the overall dynamics, remain
unfathomably complex. In a system of reflexive agents, attempts by
academics to ‘game’ the publication system or reliance on bibliometric
techniques for academic employment and promotion are emergent processes
which can disrupt any codified attempt to describe the dynamics of an
educational ecosystem. However, these complexities arise within the
context of observable information dynamics, like Ulanowicz, Leydesdorff
works with a generative model on the principle that what is observed in
nature may be compared with what is predicted by the model. Theoretical
refinement and elaboration go hand-in-hand with empirical observation.
Beyond the validity of any particular analytical technique for making
sense of the dynamics of an ecology, there is a more practical question
as to how the coordination between the different functions of an
ecological management system might be coordinated. Analysis inevitably
produces distinctions about the inter-relationships between different
functional components, and the job of any metasystem is to coordinate
the relationships between those different functions.</p>

<h2>Education as an Ecological ‘Commons’<a class="headerlink" href="#education-as-an-ecological-commons" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The issue of hierarchical and heterarchical control in the management of
‘commons’ resources such as fisheries and forests has been the subject
of debate for many years [&#64;robbins_political_2011]. The ‘Commons’
provides an empirically observable situation to inform the ways in which
the organisation of decision-making and ecological balance are related.
Eleanor Ostrom analysed the ways in which the commons could be managed,
arguing that centralised management was considerably less successful
than collective self-governance among the community of stakeholders for
whom the commons was meaningful. She developed a social-ecological
framework for developing criteria within which effective governance
could be established.</p>
<p>This community management of the commons entailed the creation of
particular distinctions about specific functions that needed to be
performed in order to manage resources. For example, from the analysis
of forest managment, Agarwal showed that the commitment by members of
the community in protecting the environment, and being clear about what
it is they are protecting is paramount[&#64;agarwal_participatory_2001]. The
demand for clarity in community-based distinction-making leads to the
creation of entities such as guards, patrol groups or a council. Local
control in such situations produces what Robbins argues is “a
concomitant institutional change, a kind of “technology of governance,”
which obligated local committees to track and categorize the forests of
the region, to work with thousands of residents to establish rules, and
to launch an ongoing census of forest resources.”
[&#64;robbins_political_2011]</p>
<p>Ostrom’s analysis of the commons draws on game theory, identifying that
the basic problem with centralisation is that managers are left with
trying to change rules relating to different parts of the operations of
the system about which they do not have complete information. Like
Beer’s analysis of hierarchy, the attenuation processes mean that
inevitably the model of reality that managers have does not represent
the full complexity of the system to be managed. For management to take
action under such circumstances, for example by changing rules of
managing the commons, results in shifts in emphasis and evolution which
then create a new narrative among the stakeholders that produces further
consequences.</p>
<p>Like Beer, Ostrom’s approach to this is to attempt to understand the
diversity of action within institutions better. She attempts to model
what she calls the ‘action-situation,’ developing an ‘institutional
grammar.’ In doing so, she aims ‘to describe institutions in ways that
transcend normative categories or ‘slogan words’
[&#64;ostrom_understanding_2005]. Ostrom’s theoretical language is a
language of distinctions between ‘rules’ that coordination the actions
of different individuals in the system. One of the questions she tries
to address is how distinctions are agreed and stabilised. In
distinguishing ‘shared strategies,’ ‘norms’ and ‘rules’ she aims to
identify those rules which have to be agreed if the commons is to be
managed successfully. She lists:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Boundary rules: rules about who is able to enter a particular
position in the institution</p></li>
<li><p>Position rules: The set of actions role holders are permitted to
make</p></li>
<li><p>Choice rules: The set of constraints bearing upon an individual in a
position when making a decisions</p></li>
<li><p>Information rules: the level of information available to each
participant</p></li>
<li><p>Aggregation rules: The extent to which cooperation is required to
make a decision</p></li>
<li><p>Payoff rules: rewards and sanctions for particular actions taken, or
for particular reading of state variables</p></li>
<li><p>Scope rules: the determination of a range of outcome responses in a
known variable</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Rules are distinctions, and like any distinction, they have two sides:
there is the side within the distinction which says that this is the way
to obey the rule; equally, there is the distinction about what isn’t
within the rule. ‘Boundary rules,’ for example, distinguish different
participants; ‘position rules’ distinguish the positions between
individuals, and ‘choice rules’ determine the choices of action
individuals can make. Ostrom applied her distinctions to real situations
of commons management. From empirical evidence she identified a large
variety of attributes which determined the ‘Boundary rules’ concerning
who was allowed access to commons resources, what she terms an
‘authorized appropriator.’ These included concepts like nationality or
residency, but also the ability or skill to use a particular technology.
As distinctions, these categories have to be agreed: conversation sits
at the heart of the process.</p>
<p>Ostrom can be seen as expressing a complementary view to Beer’s
perspective on the viable system, and like Beer, she articulates the
different levels of analysis (recursion) which are required. Deriving
from an argument about the distribution of information in an
organisation, Ostrom’s rules act as filters throughout the organisation,
in a similar manner to Beer’s different regulating mechanisms. However,
Ostrom’s organisations are explicitly human beings attempting to
coordinate the management of a shared resource, where Beer’s VSM
identifies the generic principles of whole systems, recursion and the
distinction between system and metasystem. It is notable that there is
no explicit metasystem in Ostrom’s model beyond the rules and
environment within which agents act. The definition of these rules
within the community result from the interactions of the many
metasystems of the individuals for whom the commons is meaningful.
Ostrom’s analysis of the commons is successful if the definition of her
distinctions within a community succeeds in managing uncertainty among
that community and their actions succeed in managing the commons.</p>
<p>Education appears similar to this: a common set of practices, resources,
buildings and opportunities which is meaningful to the community of
people who engage with it. At the same time, the relationship between a
society and a forest is not the same as the relationship between a
society and education. The difference, I suggest, is that a forest is a
relatively stable part of the lifeworld of each person responsible for
managing it. This means that agreement about what needs to be done is a
tractable task. By contrast, as was discussed in chapter 1, ‘education’
itself is a contested concept. It is this contested concept which
produces the various institutional forms of education, and while the
different institutions of education may regard themselves (or indeed
govern themselves) in a similar way to a commons, the fundamental
uncertainty about the concepts of education, and the political
environment within which these concepts are formed, mean that governing
a ‘commons of education’ presents challenges which lie beyond Ostrom’s
approach. The concept of education, and the institutions which arise
from it, are a means of managing something else which does have
collective meaning. This ‘something else’ is uncertainty.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-social-commons">
<h2>A Social Commons<a class="headerlink" href="#a-social-commons" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The way society manages its uncertainty - through its institutional
structures, its available technology, and through the capacity of its
population to organise themselves to manage uncertainty individually -
is something in which everybody has a stake. It is the critical factor
that determines whether a society can make good decisions, or whether
many brains can work as one brain. A ‘social commons’ might then be
considered to be the totality of structures, resources and capacity for
managing uncertainty.</p>
<p>Education is a means by which the uncertainties of the environment may
be managed. If environmental uncertainty increases - as it does, for
example, through concern for climate change, renewable energy, or
disease - then education provides the space for conversation about
uncertainties as they are experienced by individuals in a community.
This sometimes leads to concerted action in the form of new
understanding about climate, new forms of energy, or new drugs. However,
‘uncertainty’ is the ‘commons’ which nobody wants to admit exists, and
whilst the denial persists, so too do the pathologies identified by
Cohen and March, and by Illich. In Illich’s language, ‘regimes of
scarcity’ are produced in an effort to attenuate uncertainty, and to
appear to aid decision-making without addressing fundamental problems
underneath.</p>
<p>Illich’s message is important because it also concerns the tools for
analysis themselves. Some emphasis in this chapter has been given to
information-theoretical tools for measuring ecological health. This is
partly because they exemplify cybernetic principles and techniques. The
study of biological phenomena, or even the information theoretical
dynamics of a discourse provide insight into the broader cybernetic
principles underlying the theories which sit behind such measurements.
Since these cyberrnetic principles appear to be transdisciplinary, it
seems a defensible to claim that evidence from ecosystem dynamics
display similar organising principles to social systems. Indeed, this
was the fundamental point behind Luhmann’s work, which provides the
impetus behind Leydesdorff’s calculations. Institutions exist within
ecologies of other institutions, they exchange information with one
another through journals, and technological development is continually
shifting the constraints within which each operates. Moreover, a
technical development which increases uncertainty by providing new
options for action makes a difference to the total system of uncertainty
governance. But the choice of how the total system adapts relies on
knowledge about the kinds of uncertainty that need to be managed, the
ways in which new capabilities obviate existing institutional
structures, the impact of institutional restructure on the environment
of uncertainty, and the avoidance of a positive feedback situation.
Powerful though today’s information theoretical techniques are, we
remain a long way from any kind of metasystemic metrics about the
institution of education.</p>
<p>Ostrom’s work on the commons, although perhaps not directly applicable
to education, is nevertheless important because of the central place
that conversation plays in her model. It is through conversation that
rules and functions are agreed, and the exploration of the most
appropriate ways to adapt institutional structures and individual
behaviour relies on the coordination of multiple descriptions of
uncertainties through conversation. It is in the space of producing rich
descriptions about society that Illich’s concept of conviviality becomes
a functioning component of uncertainty governance. It is in the
convivial and creative conversation about means and ends that effective
stewardship of uncertainty management can be achieved in a
technologically-rich society.</p>

<div class="section" id="financialisation-and-uncertainty">
<h2>Financialisation and Uncertainty<a class="headerlink" href="#financialisation-and-uncertainty" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Money presents humanity with a means of symbolically codifying their
expectations. In an uncertain world, it is a powerful attenuator of
reality which maintains stability through rationalised economic
exchange: within a monetary system, I need not worry about whether my
pig is a fair exchange for your grain; I can assure myself of the
encoded value of pigs and grain with reference to what a market says
about it. As uncertainty increases, it is therefore not to be unexpected
that more and more things get ‘turned into money,’ and the modern
university, like much else in late capitalism, epitomises this.</p>
<p>Knowledge, courses, certificates, classrooms and even conversations
acquire a price. The process of ‘financialisation’ has not only
converted the tangible assets of institutions into money, but in turn it
has used this monetary conversion to produce new kinds of financial
opportunities. So institutions now raise capital by selling bonds in
themselves, property development has become one of the principal areas
of institutional activity and strategic alliances and mergers between
institutions follow patterns established on the stock exchange.</p>
<p>In education, it seems, despite (and because of) financialisation’s
processes in response to uncertainty, uncertainty proliferates driven by
the mismatch between the monetised reduction of education and the human
experience of education. At the heart of the problem is the discipline
of economics, the privileged role that that discipline has adopted in
the recent development of universities, and the manifest failures of the
discipline in society as a whole. It is notable that few major
economists have much to say about education, with the exception of
Veblen [&#64;veblen_higher_2015; &#64;veblen_theory_2017], although the emerging
financialisation of education, including changes to funding, has
attracted contemporary figures to consider education as an economic
activity
[&#64;stiglitz_creating_2014; &#64;wolf_education_2011; &#64;mcgettigan_great_2013]
or the relation between universities and the broader economy
[&#64;leydesdorff_knowledge-based_2006]. Over its intellectual history,
economics has richer explanatory frameworks than financial reduction,
some of which bring more powerful explanatory insight into the world of
education which coincide with themes already explored in this book.
Among them are the issues of scarcity, abundance and value.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="scarcity-and-economic-value">
<h2>Scarcity and Economic Value<a class="headerlink" href="#scarcity-and-economic-value" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Scarce things tend to have high economic value. This may be due to a
real physical scarcity, such as with precious metals and gemstones, or
it may be constructed in society, such as with scarce access, rights,
privileges or statuses which are conferred by authorities or constructed
through discourse. Usually, a number of different aspects of scarcity
surround a commodity.</p>
<p>Scarcity can be visceral. In acts of generosity and giving, there is a
distinction between the experience of individuals exchanging abundant
objects and individuals exchanging scarce objects. To give somebody
something precious is to imbue an exchange with significance beyond the
act of exchange. In education, such acts of generosity are not uncommon:
the sharing of an original insight, the giving of books, or the giving
of time are all aspects of generosity which express hope and confidence
in the future through the giving up of something in the present. To
provide ‘education’ is to do more than exchange a service for money; it
is an act of faith. Arendt argues:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“Education is the point at which we decide whether we love the world
enough to assume responsibility for it, and by the same token save it
from that ruin which except for renewal, except for the coming of the
new and the young, would be inevitable. And education, too, is where
we decide whether we love our children enough not to expel them from
our world and leave them to their own devices, nor to strike from
their hands their chance of undertaking something new, something
unforeseen by us, but to prepare them in advance for the task of
renewing a common world” [&#64;arendt_krise_1958]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Economic theory tends to begin with wants and needs, means and ends and
views money as a way of matching one with the other. The abstracted
coordination of means sits at the heart of the etymology of the word
“economic,” which referred originally to ‘household management.’ In
education, focus on the coordination of ‘means,’ together with fuzzy
thinking about ‘ends’ has fed into economic thinking about education
from both sides of an argument about whether education is a business,
and about how it should be funded.</p>
<p>Some economists felt that the word ‘economic’ was a poor description of
the scientific discipline. In the 19^th^ century, Richard Whately asked
if what went by the name ‘economics’ studied not wants and needs, but
<em>exchange</em>. He suggested an alternative:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>[Adam] Smith, indeed, has designated his work a treatise on the
“Wealth of Nations” but this supplies a name only for the
subject-matter [economics], not for the science itself. The name I
should have preferred as the most descriptive, and on the whole least
objectionable, is that of ‘Catallactics,’ or the “Science of
Exchanges.”[&#64;whately_introductory_1832]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Catallactics was preferred and developed within what became known as the
Austrian economic approach first by Von Mises, and later by Friedrich
Hayek. It was a way of thinking which emphasised subjectivity and
guarded against abstractions of large-scale economic processes through
modelling [&#64;hayek_law_2012]. Von Mises’s subjectivism is set-out in his
book <em>Human Action</em> [&#64;mises_human_2012] where he touches on one of the
fundamental issues in economic exchange, and directly acknowledges the
fact that education is a special case of exchange:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“There are things which are not for sale and for whose acquisition
sacrifices other than money and money’s worth must be expended. He who
wants to train himself for great achievements must employ many means,
some of which may require expenditure of money. But the essential
things to be devoted to such an endeavour are not purchasable. Honor,
virtue, glory, and likewise vigor, health, and life itself play a role
in action both as means and as ends; but they do not enter into
economic calculation.” [&#64;mises_human_2012 216]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Hayek developed a systematic subjectivist theory which bears much
similarity to cybernetic epistemology [&#64;hayek_sensory_2014]. In dealing
with larger-scale economic processes, he extended these cybernetic ideas
and focused on the relationship between information in markets (through
price signals) and their associated social consequences.</p>
<p>To make education fit an economic calculation, the scarcity of what
education does has to be constructed and codified. The social structures
of university, school, college, publisher and scholarly society contrive
to make education and knowledge scarce. Declarations about the scarcity
of knowledge and skill can be reinforced by restrictions on entry to
professions or other forms of employment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="economic-transduction-and-scarcity">
<h2>Economic Transduction and Scarcity<a class="headerlink" href="#economic-transduction-and-scarcity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To declare something as scarce is to make a particular distinction, and
like any distinction, this results from a transduction process. The
process of upholding a distinction about a category of thing must also
uphold the distinction between what counts as a thing and what doesn’t.
Sometimes things which appear ordinary or abundant are declared to be
scarce. In such cases, it can be that the act of decaring scarcity is
more important than the object which is determined to be scarce.
Fairytales and religions are full of ordinary objects imbued with
declared scarcity through granting them magical powers: from Aladdin’s
lamp to the transubstantiation of the christian eucharist, this
artificial scarcity remains a powerful force. Might it be the same with
declaring knowledge to be scarce?</p>
<p>The scarcity-making process can be visualised as a function of the
metasystem in its management of uncertainty surrounding ‘wants and
needs’ as is shown in Figure
<a class="reference external" href="#ref:moneypic">[ref:moneypic]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”ref:moneypic”}. Declaring the scarcity of knowledge, skill
and opportunity is not a modern invention. Declared scarcity was the
cornerstone of medieval guilds, and a principal model of the early
universities. Today’s professional bodies, trades unions, global
corporations and universities follow in the same pattern. The
codification of scarcity has further developed within professional
discourses within Universities. The economics discourse maintains its
own practices and journals and in recent years has increased its
influence in providing a codified narrative for comprehending the
organisational dynamics of all aspects of the education system.</p>
<p>Codifying wants and needs through money is not the only way of making a
transduction, however. As von Mises’s insight points out, there are
things which are not for sale but for which sacrifices other than money
are made. In other words, there are things which are not codified as
money, but nevertheless appear in human exchange as mediators of human
action.</p>
<p>Gifts by definition are not for sale (although they may of course be
purchased by the giver). The transduction which declares something as a
‘gift’ also declares its scarcity but it doesn’t do this to uphold the
exchange value of the gift object, but instead to uphold the
significance of the act of giving. Such is the case with ancient
sacrificial rituals, the vestige of which survives in modern religious
practice (for example, the Christian Eucharist). A diagrammatic way of
presenting this is shown in Figure
<a class="reference external" href="#gift">[gift]</a>{reference-type=”ref” reference=”gift”} where the gift
object is a mediator between two metasystems (of the giver and receiver)
which both express their uncertainty through the gift situation. Giving,
in this sense, is a kind of revealing of the soul.</p>
<p>In this gift situation, which has been studied by economists as
‘potlatch’ [&#64;mauss_gift:_2011; &#64;bataille_accursed_1991] uncertainty and
vulnerability revealed through the process of giving invites a
corresponding revealing of uncertainty by its receivers, in the wake of
which new conversations and new transductions make take form. It is not
just an act of love; it epitomises the depth of the human identification
as a single species. The dynamics of the ‘potlatch’ are important in the
management of uncertainty, and while the marketisation of education has
pursued an exchange-related economic model, the potlach provides a
complementary and equally effective method of managing uncertainty.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="potlatch">
<h2>Potlatch<a class="headerlink" href="#potlatch" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is the ambiguity of the gift and the act of giving which makes it so
powerful. Where economic exchange is a codified transaction whose
meaning must be clear to all who participate in it, a gift is an object
which functions in an intersubjective relation which reveals something
of the inner worlds of the giver and the receiver. As an invitation to
reveal individual uncertainty, social cohesion arises from a deeper
intersubjective understanding which facilitates communication.</p>
<p>The suspicion that economic phenomena rest on something more primitive
is a view pursued by a number of thinkers in the 20^th^ century. George
Bataille [&#64;bataille_accursed_1991], for example, influenced by Mauss’s
concept of potlatch [&#64;mauss_gift:_2011], argued that the potlatch
arrangements within communities were processes of acknowledging the
fundamental uncertainties of existence. Bataille notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Classical economy imagined the first exchanges in the form of barter.
Why would it have thought that in the beginning a mode of acquisition
such as exchange had not answered the need to acquire, but rather the
contrary need to lose or squander? […]</p>
<p>Potlatch is, like commerce, a means of circulating wealth, but it
excludes bargaining. More often than not it is the solemn giving of
considerable riches, offered by a chief to his rival for the purpose
of humiliating, challenging and obligating him.
[&#64;bataille_accursed_1991]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Bataille argues that squander was then the principal economic act, and
in early societies it took the form of war, ritual sacrifice and lavish
feasts. He pointed out that throughout history, the regularities of
human civilization involved waste, not rational productivity: from the
pyramids to the palace of Versaille, from the Crusades to the world wars
of the 20^th^ century, waste appears to be the most significant feature.
Arguing that such waste can be accounted for by theorising the needs of
human beings to expend ‘excess energy’ Bataille wrote a remarkable
economic theory - although much disregarded by modern economists. There
is a mystery about economic exchange, and those economists who have
sought deeper than simple mathematical descriptions have numbered
themselves in the discipline since its beginning.</p>
<p>What Bataille calls ‘excess energy’ might equally be called ‘unmanaged
uncertainty.’ The making of gifts, or the squander of wealth, is a
powerful communication of whatever uncertainty lies at the heart of
existence. As a public symbol, it invites other communicative acts to
make sense of it by those it is presented to. In terms of the management
of uncertainty, squander makes sense.</p>
<p>In education, the squandering of large sums of money both for learning
and enjoyment has been a feature of student life since the beginning of
the universities. It is not explicable as a rational economic
transaction. When Mises discusses catallaxy in the pursuit of pleasure
or the gaining of honour, he is left without a rational explanation,
having to bracket-off those aspects of exchange which cannot be
conceived of in terms of money. Bataille provides a rational explanation
not in terms of a bargain, but in terms of a logic of squander which
expresses a social order.</p>
<p>Bataille never discusses education. However, his principal insight that
the original purpose of economic exchange might be loss to the giver,
rather than gain for the receiver also applies to education: why do we
assume that the drive in education is for students to ‘gain’ knowledge,
rather than for lecturers to pass it on for free? Thorstein Veblen made
the observation of the apparently illogical and squanderous behaviour of
the bourgeoisie, and in this context he commented that higher education,
with its peculiar rituals, vestments, and orders of status, was a
fundamentally ‘atavistic’ aspect of social life belonging to the world
of the “angekok and the rainmaker”[&#64;veblen_theory_2017] rather than
early modern America. The dark motives behind Bataille’s logic of
squander find expression in Veblen’s description of the desire by the
leisure classes to gain what he calls “intimacy with the occult forces.”</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-higher-education-market">
<h2>The Higher Education ‘Market’<a class="headerlink" href="#the-higher-education-market" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Education involves economic exchange <em>and</em> giving. Teachers have to be
paid, and in recent years, the economic rationale for payment to
teachers has led to an increasing codification of what they do in terms
of money and the successes of their students. This process has achieved,
if nothing else, the exposure of deeper confusion about the distinctions
which are made about education. Although Roger Brown may be correct to
say that “the market is unstoppable”[&#64;brown_higher_2010], the direction
of travel and momentum of the market in education seems to be towards
ever-increasingly fine-grained distinctions about what education does.
The ‘unstoppable’ process is driven by the continual inadequacy of
preceding distinctions to capture the essence of what education does,
leading to successive ‘fixes’ which attempt to codify the next level of
activity. For example, measurements of teacher success by examining
student grades has given way to measuring student satisfaction, and more
recently, ‘learning gain.’ One may comfortably predict that each new
metric will be as inadequate as the last, each requiring some new
refinement to tweak the performance measure.</p>
<p>At the heart of this process are not metrics per se, but the question of
whether the distinctions made about intellectual accomplishment,
certificates, personal growth, social networks, employability,
knowledge, skill, judgement and wisdom can be interpreted through the
lens of money. ‘Marketisation’ is monetary colonisation - more
specifically, the colonisation of the debate about higher education by
the discipline of economics. The completeness of the colonisation is
evidenced by the fact that critics of the transformation of education
into a ‘market’ tend to adopt the received economic narratives in order
to challenge it. For example, it will be argued that marketisation does
not offer ‘value for money,’ or that it is ‘wasteful’ of public
resources, or that it increases ‘inequality,’ where value for money,
waste and inequality are all determined within the economic discourse.
Stiglitz, for example, presents an argument for creating a ‘learning
society’ by relating prosperity, innovation and productivity and
situating their causal nexus as the learning engendered in a
society[&#64;stiglitz_creating_2015]. Producing impressive data relating
growth and levels of education, Stiglitz uses an armoury of econometric
techniques which situate education at the heart of a model of idealised
agents. Stiglitz has been a powerful critic of the marketising forces of
education; yet at the same time uncritical of the theory-practice gaps
which open up within his own discipline as one tries to reason about the
deeply complex processes of skill development.</p>
<p>In an analysis of recent UK Higher education policy, Andrew McGettigan
remarks that:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“Education is being re-engineered by stealth through a directed
process of market construction, each move designed to protect the
elite and expose the majority, At the same time, the gamble involves
running the risk of sub-prime degrees. Existing quality assurance,
which has its faults, is supplanted by ‘value for money’ a
‘risk-based’ system, and a regulator tasked with promoting
competition.” [&#64;mcgettigan_great_2013]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Such worries about ‘quality’ are predicated on an economic intervention
whose efficacy is partly tied up with instruments of assessment together
with economic thinking that concerns the ‘production function’ of
education. The provision of resources for education, how it should be
paid for, who should pay for it, what its benefits are, and so on form
the nexus of these arguments. On both sides of the debate, rational
predictions are made for the access to higher education, for the
long-term social effects of policy. Criticism of policy is often made on
economic grounds: that the new system of ‘loans’ is more expensive than
the previous system, and so on.</p>
<p>Accounts of the costs of Higher Education in the US are well-documented,
as is the rapidly rising burden of student debt in the UK. Demand for
education - at least for the moment - remains high. Institutions of
Higher Education have established themselves as businesses, with their
leaders stylising themselves as ‘captains of industry,’ on salaries to
match. Many educational institutions have become real-estate developers,
ploughing the sums of student loans collected into new buildings. In
many towns, universities are the only organisations that have the
capital resources to transform the built environment in this way, making
them important business partners for cash-strapped civic leaders, who
are in turn rewarded with the trappings of academic status.</p>

<h2>Education’s Challenge to Economics<a class="headerlink" href="#education-s-challenge-to-economics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Education hosts the economic discourse as it stands, and it now shapes
itself on the tenets of certain aspects of that discourse concerning
financialisation. Yet as a highly complex social phenomenon, ‘education’
is in a unique position to <em>challenge</em> the conduct of economic discourse
as a whole with phenomena which demand explanations which are not
readily available through conventional mainstream economics.</p>
<p>Education’s phenomena are tangible: not only institutional finances, but
student success, staff and student wellbeing, institutional status,
human perception, conversation, excitement, boredom and, perhaps above
all, the economic import of ideas. These are phenomena which can be
explained far less easily than the broad characterisation of ‘society’
or ‘markets’ with which much economics concerns itself. Moreover, as
education hosts and embraces the economics discourse and its allied
disciplines, and institutions covet the trappings of status surrounding
such things as Nobel prizes, it is more than surprising that the context
within which the whole thing happens is never discussed. Economics
instead shrouds itself in the embrace of obscure econometrics as the
foundation of most of its intellectual outputs, despite loud criticism
that such mathematisation is either useless
[&#64;hayek_use_1945; &#64;keynes_treatise_2013] or perpetuates a deeper social
malaise [&#64;lawson_economics_1997].</p>
<p>The commandeering of technology to measure academic performance through
bibliometrics has encouraged reproduction of mainstream economic
narratives, whilst critique in the form of heterodox economics, or
<em>critical</em> management studies has been marginalised as a niche domain
with its own journals and conferences. Mainstream economists skilled in
econometrics - and increasingly ‘big data’ - find jobs in high powered
finance and government which those who concentrate on critique struggle
to find academic positions. The education system, the publishing system
and the economic system contrive to maintain the financialisation
process. And yet, none of it really works.</p>
<p>The structural support that education provides to the discipline of
economics is vulnerable to technological disruption. Changes to the way
status is accorded to publication, the push to publish open data for
analysis by other scholars, or to communicate ideas in new
technologically-empowered ways are likely to have an effect on the way
economics is <em>taught</em> and the way its concepts are interpreted,
critiqued and understood. Open educational resources for economics which
feature highly dynamic visualisations are becoming important features of
the online educational landscape. Free online MOOC-style courses for
disseminating economics such as the CORE project [&#64;noauthor_core_nodate]
and the Marginal Revolution University [&#64;noauthor_marginal_nodate] at
least serve to drag the subject out of the cloister. Perhaps more
importantly however, technology itself, and technology for learning and
communicating, are becoming fundamental features of social life about
which economics is not only challenged to produce explanations, but
through which it will coordinate its discourse. The means of
communication and the means by which everyone can coordinate their
understanding of society will change. It was, after all, cheap printing
which provided the means by which miners could carry copies of the
Communist Manifesto to work. The web and self-publishing may function in
a similar way.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="institutional-dependency">
<h2>Institutional Dependency<a class="headerlink" href="#institutional-dependency" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Among the constraints within which students enter higher education is
the fact that students have been inculcated into the world of classroom,
lesson and assessment since an early age. Schooling, which for most of
the 20^th^ century has been funded by the state instils <em>institutional
dependency</em> within learners so that they become conditioned to demand
the same practices in early adulthood for which they are then required
to pay, upholding the financialisation process within education.
Society’s education system stacks the cards in favour of students taking
on debt to maintain a process of institutional dependence.</p>
<p>In an educational market, students bargain large sums of money (which
most they haven’t yet earned) for imagined increases in social status
brought about through certification from an institution with a
particular status. This is particularly true in a post-industrial
landscape where alternative institutional structures such as
mass-employing heavy industry no longer present an alternative option.
Existential anxiety about a future without a degree equates to a future
without the comfort and security of membership of an institution,
whether it is an employer, a loving family or an educational
institution. This anxiety is fed by the various mechanisms which
reinforce the scarcity of certification and effectively force
individuals back into the arms of an educational institution.</p>
<p>The exchange of money for education is a ‘leap of faith’ where the
burden of risk falls on the purchaser: if it goes wrong, it is the
student’s fault. Exchange itself, however, is not always as simple as
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a\)</span> exhanges money with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b\)</span> for good <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c\)</span> in order to meet basic or
material needs. Mises’s thinking about ‘catallactics’ revealed that he
also saw the drive for attaining what he called ‘ideal’ needs:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“The subject of catallactics is all market phenomena with all their
roots, ramifications and consequences. It is a fact that people in
dealing on the market are motivated not only by the desire to get
food, shelter, and sexual enjoyment, but also by manifold “ideal”
urges. Acting man is always concerned both with ‘material’ and ‘ideal’
things.” [&#64;mises_human_2012 234]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Here lies the heart of education’s challenge to economics. The
establishment of a ‘market’ in education throws the spotlight directly
on to that zone of conflict where critical inquiry into the nature of
exchange itself is most pronounced, where the boundary lies between
‘material’ and ‘ideal’ things. As Veblen noted, education only gives the
superficial appearance of a rational enterprise. The need for education
(like the church) to inculcate institutional dependency through
schooling is an indication that the institution of education’s rational
foundation is insecure. In other words, education’s rationalisation and
financialisation leaves a large amount of unmanaged uncertainty which
leaves it requiring to exert forms of oppression. The response of
politicians and economists to this uncertainty has been to create
ever-more elaborate theories, often implicitly upholding oppression, and
developing instruments for codifying it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="information-and-employment-screening">
<h2>Information and Employment Screening<a class="headerlink" href="#information-and-employment-screening" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The decision problem of education is faced by an ever-increasing number
of people across the world: most young people (and some older) now ask
“what should I study?” “where should I go?” “can I afford it?” “what
will I do with it?” How does a person decide to use their time and spend
their money on educating themselves? What problem does the decision to
engage in education solve? When so much is available online, why do more
not simply say “I can teach myself?”</p>
<p>The market-oriented rationale of education sees the grounds for decision
as rational processes which are determined by the evaluation of possible
pay-offs of different courses of action. A market economy in education
requires an information environment within which comparative
distinctions can be made. In the UK, this information environment has
been politically constructed in an attempt to drive the education
market. Every year sees new statistical comparative measures of
institutional performance: “Key Information Sets” articulate data on
employability, course salary expectations, fees and staff-student
ratios. Student Surveys produce data on what students think about their
courses. Data is produced on the graduate destinations of students,
number of students dropping out of courses, research metrics rate
universities by their publications, and teaching assessments on the
quality of their teaching. Each metric features as a priority for every
university’s strategy because each poor performance in any area
translates into negative news coverage and potential damage to
institutional reputation.</p>
<p>The data amplify the problem of educational choice, but does little to
help make a decision. The problem is not the availability of
information, but the assumption that this information carries equal
meaning for all individuals in a society such that their actions can be
rational bringing ‘competition’ to the education marketplace. But since,
as Popper argued, knowledge, and consequently the ability to interpret
the data, is distributed, the effort to establish ‘information’ about
education is a centrally-planned attempt to coordinate a system of
pseudo-independent institutions through propaganda. Popper argues:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The holistic planner overlooks the fact that it is easy to centralize
power but impossible to centralize all knowledge, which is distributed
over many individual minds, and whose centralization would be
necessary for the wise wielding of centralized power. But this fact
has farreaching consequences. Unable to ascertain what is in the minds
of many individuals, he must try to control and stereotype interests
and beliefs by education and propaganda. [&#64;popper_poverty_2002 89]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>As O’Neil has noted, data has become almost indistinguishable from
propaganda [&#64;oneil_weapons_2017]. And yet, educational qualifications,
the institution that one graduated from, the testimony of skill and
capability given by others, are all pieces of information which are
important when graduates look for work. Stiglitz developed his theory of
<em>screening</em> as a way of explaining the decision-making processes of
employers recruiting a new employee [&#64;stiglitz_theory_1975]. The signals
produced by education feature as deciding criteria to manage the problem
the employer is faced with. Second-guessing these signals and finding
the best way of presenting them is the problem of the student. Stiglitz
explains his focus on the ‘labelling of individuals’ as on:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>the economic costs and benefits of labelling, the institutions that
provide it, and the determination of the equilibrium amount of
screening under various institutional arrangements
[&#64;stiglitz_theory_1975]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Stiglitz is highlighting the structure of transductions which surround
the selection of an employee. Because each of the transductions -
surrounding the ‘labelling,’ the costs and benefits, and the other
institutional arrangements - are mutable the process of choosing an
employee remains inherently uncertain irrespective of the amount of
information available. Equally, for the student seeking to convince an
employer to hire them, choices concerning the institution they attend or
the course they study are no guarantee that the right signals will meet
with approval.</p>
<p>The problem of choice of a new employee in a company’s recruitment
process is mirrored by the problem of an educational institution in
selling what they offer to potential students. For the employer, the
identification of a specific problem is determined through the writing
of a job description. This is a transduction which attempts to codify
the imagined work of a person in the organisation in the future. While
the job description stipulates the screening signals which a candidate
should present, it cannot stipulate the precise qualities which
determine whether a candidate will fit into the organisation. It might
be hoped that such qualities will be identified at interview, but both
the process of stipulating job descriptions and interviewing are fraught
with uncertainty. Deficiencies in skill in one area may be surmountable
in a candidate with the personal qualities to fit in to an organisation,
where the possession of requisite skill is not indicator that a
candidate will do what’s expected when in post.</p>
<p>Any signal is the result of a transduction process. That means, a
process of attenuating reality, generating an imagined world from those
attenuations, and checking that they are aligned. Educational
certification presents a complex attenuation operating in many levels of
society. But like any transduction, they operate in time. In the
job-search process, there are specific moments in time when particular
stages of transduction are important: there is a time to gain
qualifications in a university, a time to search for available jobs, a
time to apply, a time to attend interview, and so on. In each case, the
structure of attenuations is different.</p>
<p>While education concerns itself with the exchange of money for the
capacity to emit the appropriate signals which may match the ‘problems’
identified by employers, the matching of problems in this way doesn’t
account for the inherent uncertainty in the specification of problems or
in the gaining of qualifications. The context is always time, and time
can produce opportunities for individuals to engage with employment and
other life-chances which run counter to the prevailing narrative of
gaining qualifications. Through such opportunities, it is likely to be
‘gifts’ which establish a different kind of coordination of opportunity.
But it is this dimension of time and uncertainty, and the opportunity
for giving which introduces uncertainties into the business of selling
education.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="education-and-giving">
<h2>Education and Giving<a class="headerlink" href="#education-and-giving" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Institutional structures and practices and societal expectations declare
scarcity which imbues university degrees with economic value. At the
same time, the deeper goals of education - the pursuit of honour,
prestige and understanding - arise through mechanisms closer to those
described by Bataille and Veblen.</p>
<p>The most basic form of gift in education is intellectual generosity.
This can have many motives: ideas can be given in the hope that the
uncertainty that the act expresses might evoke a similar revealing of
uncertainty by the receiver, and that this in turn helps to stimulate
new conversations. Intellectual giving can also be an act of rebellion
against institutional structures which might seek to maintain the
scarcity of knowledge. The potlatch is both a mechanism for maintaining
social relations - for example, between a monarch and their subjects -
or it can be a mechanism for <em>challenging</em> or transforming social
structures. Generosity highlights the <em>abundance</em> of knowledge, and in
so doing challenges a received order which seeks to make knowledge
scarce. Intellectual generosity, like all educational interventions,
creates new communicative options generating new concepts and further
conversation.</p>
<p>Intellectual generosity is the creation of new options, and the
generation of uncertainty. In dialogue between a teacher and a student,
the intersubjective tuning-in which Schutz discusses can be seen in the
light of this process. The teacher’s revealing of their understanding
creates opportunities for asking new kinds of question. If the student
is sufficiently committed to the relationship with the teacher, then
this increase in options is an uncertainty to which the student must
adapt by generating new kinds of questions and expressing new
descriptions of their own understanding.</p>
<p>The potlatch of intellectual generosity challenges the economic
calculation of the value of a teacher or a discourse based on the number
of students that are taught. In the ‘intellectual potlatch,’ the work a
teacher puts in to transforming one student is done in the hope that the
communicative competencies gained by the student are contagious. Thus
through the transformation of communicative competences in one person
arises the potential to reformulate social relations more broadly.</p>
<p>Technological transformation has delivered new means for acting
generously. For example, in open source software development, a software
developer may make communicative and generous acts through sharing their
programming and any practical problems which they have encountered.
These acts may then become an invitation to others to similarly share
their problems with code. Online sites like <em>stackoverflow</em> become
places of exchange between programmers where the uncertainties of coding
are openly explored.</p>
<p>Artists using YouTube do something similar. The rationale of giving
online results in new communications with a wide audience, some members
of which may either contribute to the development of the work, or help
artists enlarge their audience through recommendations to others. Social
media platforms have built their business models around the ability of
individuals to ‘share’ other online artefacts they find interesting.</p>
<p>Sharing culture on Facebook or Twitter may itself be seen as a kind of
potlatch where uncertainty is exposed in the diversity or ambiguity of
resources that are shared. While the social media corporations have
found ways to financialise this behaviour through data analysis, the
behaviour itself, rather like education, speaks of the basic desire to
manage uncertainty through giving and the revealing of uncertainty.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="uncertainty-and-the-free-market">
<h2>Uncertainty and the ‘Free Market’<a class="headerlink" href="#uncertainty-and-the-free-market" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The preceding analysis has suggested a connection between potlatch acts
of generosity and the management of uncertainty. The financialisation of
education and the broader financialisation of other social systems like
health and welfare are related. The problems of education are little
different from the problems of society at large. Markets are social
phenomena which depend on codified expectations, but what is called a
‘free market’ is a similar phenomenon to the runaway technology
discussed in chapter 8, which Illich and others criticise: indeed, for
Illich, a market is simply a kind of technology which coordinates human
transactions. The problem with financialising education lies in the
failure to understand that monetary codification does not fit all the
ways in which uncertainty is managed, and that gifts present an equally
effective and complementary mechanism.</p>
<p>Uncertainty plays a central role in the thought of two of the 20^th^
century’s leading economists: Keynes and Hayek. Hayek’s thinking
extended the subjectivist perspective of von Mises, focusing on the
uncertainty of information. Hayek’s picture of information in society is
very close to the concept of ‘multiple descriptions’ presented in
chapter 2. Hayek argued that there is not one single source of
information, but many different descriptions, which in economic terms
are conveyed by many different prices. The fact that this diversity of
perspective results in the behaviour of a single market suggests that
there is a heterachical organisation of multiple descriptions which
produces a coordinated frame of action:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The whole acts as one market, not because any of its members survey
the whole field, but because their limited individual fields of vision
sufficiently overlap so that through many intermediaries the relevant
information is communicated to all. The mere fact that there is one
price for any commodity — or rather that local prices are connected
in a manner determined by the cost of transport, etc. - brings about
the solution which (it is just conceptually possible) might have been
arrived at by one single mind possessing all the information which is
in fact dispersed among all the people involved in the process.
[&#64;hayek_use_1945]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Hayek’s view was that it was impossible to organise an effective economy
centrally because information was never distributed evenly and this
created inequalities which favoured those in power. While he pointed to
the problems of central control in Soviet Russia, he could have equally
pointed to the centralising behaviour of right-wing governments in
attempting to create artificial information mechanisms which are loaded
with bias in favour of maintaining an artificial market in education.
Hayek’s defence of the ‘free market’ on the basis that central planning
could not work pitted him against those who advocated government
intervention as a way of managing uncertainty, like Keynes.</p>
<p>Drawing on his early work on probability [&#64;keynes_treatise_2013], Keynes
argued that decisions were taken by individuals in the context of an
unknowable future, and that individuals in making decisions had to take
steps to manage their uncertainty. For this reason, the codification of
expectations provided by money and markets was a kind of technology
which helped to coordinate uncertainty giving individuals flexibility to
act as they saw fit in the future. Keynes understood that the behaviour
of markets could be such that they started to feed uncertainty rather
than help manage it. It was this problem which he identified in the Wall
Street Crash when he remarked “we have magneto [alternator] trouble”
[&#64;keynes_essays_2009].</p>
<p>Since the 1980s it has been the ideas of Hayek and not Keynes which have
dominated the world financial system. Hayek’s work on information led to
information itself becoming a commodity as the markets became the source
of endless innovation in creating new options for investment and making
profit. As with any other technology, new options equal new
uncertainties. Hayek assumed that economic agents would react rationally
to new options, selecting those most favourable to them. But as with
institutions, it seems to be that it is the uncertainty to which
individuals react.</p>
<p>For the individual, how to manage the uncertainties created by new
financial instruments, metrics or opportunities may invite the
temptation to express those uncertainties in what Bataille would regard
as acts of squander. Although on the surface this might appear
irrational, from the perspective of the individual’s uncertainty
management, it can be seen differently. A related strategy for dealing
with uncertainty is what Veblen identified as <em>sabotage</em> being one of
the principal mechanisms at work in the price system.</p>
<p>Sabotage of education’s information environment conducted by both
institutions and students does appear to be present. While governments
have sought to support free market principles through the creation of
information with which students can make choices about institutions, the
impact of this information, alongside policy decisions to increase fees
and raise interest rates, has been to increase uncertainty. Institutions
have responded to this uncertainty by attempting to ensure that the data
they submit to government statistical agencies shows them in the best
possible light, and direct their educational activities accordingly,
offering inducements to students to complete satisfaction surveys or
offering internships to boost employability statistics.</p>
<p>Students react to the uncertainty created by new information by
attempting to break the connection between ‘improved student
satisfaction’ and higher fees. If enhanced information scores means
higher fees, then why submit information which will provide an excuse
for it? Non-compliance with student survey data, through to deliberate
sabotage are political acts - perhaps not of squander, but certainly of
exuberance, as students seek to render the politically-determined
information system of education increasingly unstable.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="homo-meta-economicus">
<h2>Homo Meta-Economicus<a class="headerlink" href="#homo-meta-economicus" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Throughout this book, the idea that technology creates uncertainty has
been central. In this chapter we have considered that economic exchange
presents two fundamental ways of managing uncertainty: through
codification of expectations and through gifts. Education has become
increasingly beholden to the discipline of economics, and through this,
has deployed technologies to measure educational activities, the
performance of teachers, research outputs and knowledge exchange.
Uncertainty is generated by the tools used to feed the economic calculi.
But the economic calculi are themselves a form of technology, creating
uncertainties in their own right.</p>
<p>In the runaway economic world we inhabit, technology and economics are
increasingly indistinguishable: trading systems, for example, are
econometric theories encoded as technology. In chapter 5 it was argued
that the university’s scientific mission should focus on managing the
uncertainties created by technology, and consequently seek to limit the
power of technology within a human scale. Now the same thing can be said
of economics. Economics is a source of environmental uncertainty for the
university, and if that uncertainty is to be managed, then the
university needs to become the locus of power to limit economic
innovation. As with any other technology, it can only do this if it
understands the nature of the environment within which economic
technologies operate.</p>
<p>From a cybernetic perspective, economics’s twin processes of
codification of expectation and gifts into the environment can be seen
as two aspects of a metasystem function which must manage uncertainty.
Here, we start to see a similar topology to that of Beer’s VSM, where
one function of the metasystem focuses on internal operational
codification (exchange) - what Beer calls ‘System 3,’ and the other part
of the metasystem engages directly with understanding the environment
and considering what adaptation might be necessary - what Beer calls
‘System 4’ (see chapter 4). This metasystem relationship is shown in
Figure <a class="reference external" href="#ref:economictotal">9.1</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”ref:economictotal”} which illustrates two ‘people’ managing
their internal and external uncertainties within a shared environment.
The figure shows that if these are two basic metasystem features of
economic exchange in education, then a third element in the metasystem
must coordinate the balance between the two: essentially, when to give
and when to depend on codified norms. This third element is a
‘meta-economics.’</p>
<p><img alt="The balancing of an economic system in education which coordinatesgiving (generosity) with the environment and codification ofexpectations (exchange)" src="_images/gsd3.png" />{#ref:economictotal
width=”\textwidth”}</p>
<p>The diagram also applies to institutions themselves. The challenge
articulated in this diagram relates to the way the university
understands and can adapt to its environment. The gift is a way of
coming to know the uncertainty of the environment: to give is to invite
the expression of uncertainty by others. While it seems unthinkable in
the marketised world we have constructed for today’s universities that
they might consider offering what they do for free to society, to give
like this provides a way in which the university can understand its
environment well enough that it might be able to adapt to it
successfully.</p>
<p>At the same time expectations codified by money in human exchange also
play a role: economic exchange remains an important way in which
uncertainty can be managed, and teachers paid for. But the critical
element is the nature of the coordination process within the metasystem,
and the role of technology in creating synergy between the interacting
systems. The ‘meta-economics’ in the two metasystems might be thought of
as a way of steering economic thinking between those processes which
engage with the uncertainties of the environment and those processes
which deal with internal uncertainties. Technology, meanwhile, is a
medium for the articulation of expressions of shared uncertainty in the
environment. Education’s ‘meta-economics’ may provide society with a
mechanism whereby the technology of economics might be brought under
control.</p>

<h2>Higher Learning and Schooling<a class="headerlink" href="#higher-learning-and-schooling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Educational achievement at all levels is considered to provide increased
personal security and a foundation for success in life. The university,
being the highest level of education, is assumed to provide the highest
level of security and success. But is what happens in the university
<em>that</em> different from what happens in the school or kindergarten? Is it
simply that a person is better prepared for life, or has a greater
chance of personal security and success after gaining a degree rather
than a school certificate? We need to understand the intrinsic nature
and value of levels of education, and particularly higher learning.</p>
<p>This question cannot be answered unless the social environment within
which education occurs is taken into account. Degree certificates, or
even PhDs are only worth something if they are meaningful to others (for
example, employers) in society. They are declarations of personal status
by an institution which, if trust is lost in the institution, may be of
little worth. Trust in institutions is easier to establish in a world
where those institutions perform a role in managing society’s
uncertainty. As society’s uncertainty increases, and the capacity of
institutions to mop-up uncertainty diminishes (or indeed, they
exacerbate it), then there will naturally be a consequent loss of trust
in degree certificates. Therefore, the guarantee of increased security
with the ‘higher learning’ of the university should be treated with some
caution.</p>
<p>However, beyond the certificate, there are other aspects to the stages
of education which may have intrinsic value. Certificates - whether from
university or school - carry an implicit claim that personal
developmental progress occurred conforming to the processes of the
institution. Kindergartens, schools and universities are different kinds
of institutions and so they indicate different kinds of developmental
progress. But if there is intrinsic value to these stages of
developmental progress, there is little foundation for believing that
any progress was purely the result of the institution’s procedures. Each
individual has a present and personal history of relationships and
conversations. Different institutional settings provide different ways
of coordinating conversations. If there is an intrinsic difference
between higher learning and schooling to be identified, then we should
ask about how the relationships and conversations of the university are
different from all the other relationships and conversations both in the
preceding development of the individual and in their extra-institutional
life.</p>
<p>Institutional structures and processes are an important factor in the
coordination of conversations, and those structures and practices, I
have argued, have reacted to uncertainty in the environment. Since
institutions - universities, schools, hospitals and so on - are
populated by people, we need to ask how and why human beings react to
uncertainty in the different ways that they do within their
institutional context. In what ways are their reactions to uncertainty
shaped by their own personal histories? In what ways might higher
learning or its absence have a bearing on the ways that individuals -
professors, students, managers, cleaners and caretakers - handle
uncertainty?</p>
<p>Why, for example, does it appear that some individuals in organisations
reach for powerful technologies and use them in ways which reinforce
their position in existing institutional structures at the expense of
others? (Sometimes these people are very well-qualified!) Is there a way
of rationalising about the diversity of human behaviour in organisations
where some people compete with others for domination, while others give
generously irrespective of the circumstances? What do we <em>hope</em> for as a
result of the ‘higher learning?’</p>

<p>The idealism of those who hope for the best is met with a pessimistic
response regarding ‘human nature.’ Konrad Lorenz, one of the first
cybernetic thinkers about animal behaviour says:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The competition between human beings destroys with cold and diabolic
brutality… Under the pressure of this competitive fury we have not
only forgotten what is useful to humanity as a whole, but even that
which is good and advantageous to the individual. […] One asks,
which is more damaging to modern humanity: the thirst for money or
consuming haste… in either case, fear plays a very important role:
the fear of being overtaken by one’s competitors, the fear of becoming
poor, the fear of making wrong decisions or the fear of not being up
to snuff… [&#64;lorenz_aggression_2002]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Lorenz’s pessimism invites the question “where does the fear come from?”</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>is it ‘inside’ or is it ‘outside,’ or does it lie at the interface
between the two? While the insecurity and uncertainty produced by fear
may produce the behaviour Lorenz describes, cases of selfless and
generous behaviour throughout history, even in a climate of fear,
attests to the human capacity to transform one’s management of
uncertainty in one’s relation to others. What is the difference in the
development of a human being who responds destructively to those who
respond selflessly? Notwithstanding differences in genetics and any
behavioural traits which might be ascribed to them (whatever spurious
causal claims are made for this), a coherent theoretical examination of
the differences between individual motivation and behaviour, and the
differences between the educational development of individuals remains
an open question for which various theoretical apparatus exists within
psychology, sociology, biology and their systems-theoretical
counterparts.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The individual human organism, like all organisms, is surrounded by
uncertainty from its earliest development. The complex and developing
structure of the organism gives it the capacity to manage uncertainties
and coordinate actions which help it to survive and develop. This
relationship between organism and environment might be drawn as in
Figure <a class="reference external" href="#ref:basictransduction">4.3</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”ref:basictransduction”} from chapter 4. To make this diagram
more realistic, we can imagine that the principal source of uncertainty
in the environment of an organism is <em>other organisms</em>, for whom
adaptation in the face of uncertainties are circularly reproduced.</p>
<p>Lorenz studied animal behaviour focusing on the relationship between the
individual and the environment of other organisms. In his work with
geese, he noticed how the movement of chicks maintained proximity to the
mother. He called this mechanism of maintaining proximity ‘imprinting’
and explored its parameters by replacing real mothers with a wire-frame
model which was presented to the chicks within hours of hatching: as a
consequence, the baby chicks maintained proximity to this object as if
it was the mother. It was a cybernetic experiment where theoretical
models and empirical evidence combined convincingly. Lorenz was acutely
aware of the power of cybernetic explanation:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Cybernetics and general systems theory have relieved the
coming-into-existence of entirely new properties and functions of the
odium of being a miracle. It is no miracle if a pre-existent linear
chain of causes and effects becomes closed into a circle, though the
consequences may be truly epoch-making. [&#64;pribram_biology_1970]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>His ‘linear chain’ pinpointed a systemic logic to the behaviour of the
very young which raised questions as to what might happen with regard to
similar mechanisms between humans, and particularly in early childhood.</p>
<p>Psychologist John Bowlby extended Lorenz’s thinking in considering what
might happen if the imprinting process was disrupted in some way in
human relationships. Might this give rise to the psychological traumas
which were so closely studied by Freud and Jung? Bowlby called his
mechanism ‘attachment’ and expressed it in cybernetic terms: “What
principles of organisation are necessary if behaviour is to attain these
ends?” In stating his organisational principle, Bowlby sets the stage
for an analysis of personality arising from mechanisms of early life
relations and the organisational dynamics of development. He focused
particularly on the relationship between the child and the mother -
although the issue is really about the principal caregiver of whichever
sex. Like Lorenz, it appeared that proximity was the key feature:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>the child’s tie to his mother is a product of the activity of a number
of behavioural systems that have proximity to mother as a predictable
outcome. [&#64;bowlby_attachment:_1997 71]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The demonstration of the thesis demanded attention on what happened if
the proximity to the mother is <em>not</em> a predictable outcome. What
happened where the mother or father rejected the child’s affection, or
attachments were affected by death or drastic changes in circumstance?
In exploring this, Bowlby turns to some of the fundamental problems of
psychoanalysis. In examining Freud’s work on the subconscious, Bowlby
argued that the principal theme which underpinned the psychotherapeutic
approach was associated with dealing with trauma. Freud gave these
different trauma exotic names like the “Oedipus complex,” but Bowlby saw
something rather more straightforward whose systemic description cut
through some of the tortuous categories of Freudian psychoanalysis. He
noted that the consequences of damage to attachments was long-term:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>young children, who for whatever reason are deprived of the continuous
care and attention of a mother or a substitute-mother, are not only
temporarily disturbed by such deprivation, but may in some cases
suffer long-term effects which persist [&#64;bowlby_effects_1956]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The consequences of this view was that human behaviour could not be
studied individually. It had to be studied historically and
relationally. As Joan Riviere, who was Bowlby’s psychotherapist,
remarked:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>There is no such thing as a single human being, pure and simple,
unmixed with other human beings. Each personality is a world in
himself, a company of many. That self… is a composite structure
… formed out of countless never-ending influences and exchanges
between ourselves and others. These other persons are in fact
therefore part of ourselves… we are members of another.
[&#64;riviere_inner_1991]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Importantly, the consequences of attachment problems may not simply be
depression or other psychological trauma. It may result in social
behaviours which appear to be ‘normal,’ conforming to rules and
conventions, but which in other ways are blind to deeper consequences.
Bowlby points out that if attachments to caregivers become unreliable,
then new strategies for managing the uncertainties of the environment
can be found: attachments to objects, a sense of order, even attachments
to ideas, personal theories, or symbols of status accorded by a
professional position or title, or by material possessions. There is
some evidence to bear this out, particularly in the analysis of forms of
addiction [&#64;flores_addiction_2011]. Bowlby used a systems representation
to maintain consistency in the explanations for a wide variety of
psychological problems where psychoanalysis had been forced to generate
a wide variety of different categories. Most importantly, what his
systems perspective gave him was the ability to focus on the context
within which psychological problems arose in early childhood.</p>
<p>The value of a context-oriented approach is that it draws attention away
from the details of a manifest behaviour and inquires as to what kind of
mechanism might give rise to that behaviour. Among the more serious
consequences of attachment problems that Bowlby studied, the propensity
to violence he saw as a systemic consequence of loss:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>we take it for granted that, when a relationship to a special loved
person is endangered, we are not only anxious but are usually angry as
well. As responses to the risk of loss, anxiety and anger go hand in
hand. It is not for nothing that they have the same etymological root.
[&#64;bowlby_secure_2012]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>But it is not just violence. We might ask about the emergence of
<em>political</em> behaviour as a consequence of individuals seeking to
maintain stability in an uncertain environment [&#64;kraemer_politics_1996].
The circular consequences of such a connection would suggest that
political decision, which has an impact on the social context within
which children are born and educated, can itself become framed by the
damage that a previous generation was subjected to by their parents: the
sins of the father and mother are indeed laid upon the children. What
might this mean our society today in a world where inter-generational
inequality is manifest - not least by the marketisation of education?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="psychodynamics-and-attachment">
<h2>Psychodynamics and Attachment<a class="headerlink" href="#psychodynamics-and-attachment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Bowlby’s relational approach can be contrasted with Freud’s focus on the
individual psyche. Bowlby placed the individual psyche within the
context of the developing relations between the person/baby and others.
Where Bowlby doesn’t challenge Freud is in the constitution of the
psyche of the individual which leads to attachment behaviours with the
individual’s environment. Considering the constitution of conscious
experience gave Freud his most basic idea of an inner process which
produced differentiated thoughts and actions from an undifferentiated
“ocean” of experience. Freud suggested that there must be two processes
within conscious life:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>I described the type of process found in the unconscious as the
‘primary’ psychical process, in contradistinction to the ‘secondary’
process which is the one obtaining in our normal waking life.
[&#64;freud_beyond_2003]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Just as the external environment presents uncertainty, so does the
internal psychic environment, and just as Bowlby would suggest that
attachment is a strategy for managing environmental uncertainty, Freud
suggests that his psychodynamic primary and secondary process manages
the psychic uncertainty in the relations between what Freud called “Id,”
“Ego” and “Superego.”</p>
<p>Here some of the systems modelling techniques we have explored in
previous chapters are useful in speculating on the relationship between
the management of uncertainty in the psyche and the management of
uncertainty through attachment. Beer’s basic diagram of uncertainty
management which was first introduced in chapter 5 [&#64;beer_platform_1995]
can be used to present the basic relationship between the Freudian
categories of Ego, Superego and Id, as shown in Figure
<a class="reference external" href="#ref:Beerfreud">[ref:Beerfreud]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”ref:Beerfreud”}:</p>
<p>Here, the Freudian Ego represents conscious life which contains
undecidable questions, or uncertainties which require management. For
Freud, the relationship between the uncertainty of unconsciousness (the
Id) and the Ego is managed by the Superego which creates rules, asserts
norms, and so on for managing uncertainty: in Beer’s language, it is a
‘meta-language of categories.’</p>
<p>Bowlby sees attachment as a process whereby each individual seeks to
manage the uncertainty of the environment, and in this sense, the
mother’s behaviour to the child complements the child’s behaviour to the
mother. If attachment behaviour is seen to arise from the Superego’s
identification of ‘proximity’ as an organising principle for the baby
and mother, then the uncertainty management processes of maintaining
proximity and the processes of managing the psychodynamic relationship
between subconscious and conscious life are connected. This speculative
mechanism is shown in Figure
<a class="reference external" href="#ref:attach">[ref:attach]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”ref:attach”}.</p>
<p>Drawing the uncertainty management process in this way helps to connect
both the psychodynamic mechanism of Freud with the relational mechanism
of Bowlby in a coherent way. It further suggests that the damage to
attachment relations will inevitably have psychodynamic effects. The
struggle to manage uncertainty with regard to proximity to a caregiver
must be related to some deeper uncertainty concerning the
undifferentiated experience of a baby (and indeed, the mother), and the
more concrete ‘categories’ of experience which arise whereby ‘proximity’
becomes a thing over which the child attempts to exercise control. In
this way, the undifferentiated subconscious of the baby and the mother,
and the mechanism by which the uncertainty of the subconscious is
managed form a coherent part of the attachment process.</p>
<p>If the attachment relation between caregiver and child is one of mutual
management of uncertainty emerging between the undifferentiated psyche
of the individual and the behaviours which manifest between individuals,
then this raises the question as to the systemic nature of the relations
which emerge as the child gets older and becomes an adult. Whatever
occurs in infancy has a bearing of what occurs later, and here perhaps
there is a way of determining the types of relations which distinguish
the different activities at different stages in education. One of the
most significant activities which have attracted the attention of
psychotherapists and educationalists, is that of creativity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-psychodynamics-of-creativity">
<h2>The Psychodynamics of Creativity<a class="headerlink" href="#the-psychodynamics-of-creativity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The creative process is privileged as one of the highest attainments of
the human intellect. Within hierarchies of learning such as Bloom’s
taxonomy [&#64;bloom_taxonomy_1956], we find ‘creativity’ at the top of a
range of intellectual achievement from memory recall at the bottom to
synthesis and analysis in the middle. Similar hierarchies exist in
Bateson [&#64;bateson_steps_1987] who suggests ‘levels’ of learning, which
begin with the kind of reflex actions that might be associated with
memory, to high level reflexive ‘learning to learn’ functions. In
Bloom’s view, which is widely shared, the high-ness of higher learner is
an ascent up this kind of hierarchy.</p>
<p>In psychoanalytical approaches to the creative process, it has been
suggested that creativity is a state of being which connects the Ego
with the Id in a continual dialectical process
[&#64;read_education_1958; &#64;ehrenzweig_hidden_1968; &#64;milner_not_2010]. This
can be compared to Freud’s therapeutic process which is
conversationally-oriented (a ‘talking cure’), drawing out utterances
from the patient where the ‘primary process’ material of dreams is
summoned into the world of the Ego and language. The cure for
psychological trauma through this conversational process lies in the
delineating of psychodynamic blockages and bringing them into the
therapist-patient conversation.</p>
<p>How is the psychotherapeutic relationship different from the learning
conversations which happen in university, or indeed in school? Referring
to Figure <a class="reference external" href="#ref:attach">[ref:attach]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”ref:attach”}, we might say that for higher learning to aim to
stimulate creative activity then something must happen in the
conversational process of education which stimulates the internal
psychodynamic process, and conversely, the creative flourishing which
results from a healthy psychodynamic process can produce novel
utterances which feed the conversational dynamic which sustains it.</p>
<p>This circular mechanism whereby conversation stimulates creativity can
be compared to Whitehead’s statement that higher learning is simply a
matter of “investing facts with imagination.” That implies a balance
between inner psychodynamic activity (imagination) with the social
conversational coordination which produces knowledge (facts). In this
sense, almost any aspect of knowledge can potentially become a vehicle
for higher learning, whether it is mechanical engineering, hairdressing
or sports car engineering. From the perspective of Gordon Pask, explored
in chapter 2, the critical feature of being ‘invested with imagination’
is to be able to generate a richness (or ‘redundancy’) of description of
whatever activity is engaged in.</p>
<p>More recent educational criticism of higher learning has focused on
particular aspects of inner development which relate to issues of
psychotherapy and addressing trauma. Ron Barnett argues that:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“A genuine higher learning is subversive in the sense of subverting
the student’s taken-for-granted world, including the world of
endeavour, scholarship, calculation or creativity, into which he or
she has been initiated. A genuine higher education is unsettling; it
is not meant to be a cosy experience.” [&#64;barnett_idea_1990]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>What Barnett describes (although he doesn’t present it like this) is an
intervention in the balance between psychic and social dynamics. This
might be a shock induced in the educational journey from which new
categories of experience find expression in new concepts. Ray Land’s
idea of the ‘threshold concept’ could then be seen as an epiphenomenon
of reconfigured psychodynamic processes:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>A threshold concept can be considered as akin to a portal, opening up
a new and previously inaccessible way of thinking about something. It
represents a transformed way of understanding, or interpreting, or
viewing something without which the learner cannot progress.
[&#64;land_overcoming_2006 3]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>For Land the idea that knowledge might be ‘troublesome’ is central. Some
concepts might seem initially objectionable or shocking, and that the
encounter with such knowledge causes trauma to which the conversational
process of learning must adapt - in a comparable way to how the
psychotherapist deals with trauma in their patients. For example, one
might consider a supporter of the National Rifle Association being
challenged with the direct consequences of lack of gun control.</p>
<p>Emphasis on trauma is also found in the work of Jack Mezirow, who argues
that a disorienting trauma is the first stage of a journey that
O’Sullivan calls “a shift of consciousness that dramatically and
irreversibly alters our way of being in the world.” In developing
Transformative Learning theory, Boyd and Meyers have made an explicit
connection between depth psychology and education, but unlike Land,
Mezirow is careful not to claim that the university is the principal
locus of such personal transformation, or that the troublesome knowledge
possessed by university teachers isn’t itself potentially subject to
‘unsettling’ - potentially, by students.</p>
<p>University teachers have the luxury of being able to create a stable
world of discourse to inhabit. Although it is argued that the point of
higher learning is to empower students with similar ‘epistemic access’
[&#64;young_alternative_2010] to lead them to “ways of shaping and guiding
inquiry so that it discovers truth”[&#64;morrow_bounds_2009], there is
something cosy in the relationship that academics have to their
discursive universe (what Young calls ‘powerful knowledge’
[&#64;young_powers_2013]) and the demand that students enter this universe
on the terms of the academy. However, why not make the same ‘unsettling’
arguments for university academics themselves? Doesn’t upholding a
position that demands epistemic challenge to students also uphold a
position of cosiness for academics who (perhaps understandably) defend
this as “higher learning?”</p>
<p>Clearly, the knowledge, status and world-view of university professors
is vulnerable to unsettling just as much as the students’ knowledge. In
recent years, this vulnerability has been exposed in the assault on
academics by management. At the same time, marketisation has led to
metrics of student satisfaction which has also challenged the
professors. Such ideas as ‘threshold concepts,’ ‘unsettling’ or
‘troublesome knowledge’ are at one level a defence against these
threats. At the same time they appear to uphold the status quo of
knowledge. The critical issue lies in accepting that trauma is indeed an
important part of learning, but that trauma can happen anywhere to
anyone.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="unsettling-unsettling">
<h2>Unsettling unsettling<a class="headerlink" href="#unsettling-unsettling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Universities are not the only places where people are challenged to
‘wake up’ and change their views about the world. Everyone is unsettled
by the death of a loved one, or a significant change to one’s
environment. Rites of passage, including sexual discovery, getting a
first job, close escape from death, emotional entanglements and violence
are all potential moments of self-realisation and awakening. Equally,
trauma resulting from these events can fall into the category of damaged
attachments that Bowlby describes. Education (and sometimes
universities) can be the locus of behaviour by staff where trauma is
inflicted by those who carry their own trauma from the past, behaving in
ways which may be cruel, insensitive or abusive. It is not uncommon to
be on the receiving end on such behaviour - so what price ‘higher
learning?’</p>
<p>The ontogeny of both staff and students follows a pattern of uncertainty
management both in relation to psychodynamic processes and social
relations. It will be in the background of the ‘withdrawn student’ as
much as it is for the ‘pompous professor.’ The biographies of
professors, as with any adult, follows a path through all stages of
education from earliest childhood. The ‘pompous professor’ at some level
reveals the impact of relationships with their mother and father,
siblings and school friends, the impact of life traumas and
disappointments, as well as successes.</p>
<p>The experiences of school are no less unsettling than the experiences of
university. For school teachers too, experiences in primary and
secondary education can be deeply unsettling. Cosiness is threatened at
moments when a situation any individual finds themselves in challenges
expectations.</p>
<p>In this sense, everyone bears the scars of ‘unsettling’ at various
stages of life. If ‘troublesome knowledge’ or ‘powerful knowledge’
cannot be the distinguishing feature of higher learning, then
distinguishing the nature of the conversations within the university
might be more promising. The higher learning of the university is
characterised by conversations and relationships which are different
from those which characterise school or kindergarten. The challenge to
identify the nature of higher learning is to identify the specific
nature of these conversations, and the difference between higher
learning conversations and those which occur at other levels of
education.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="individuation-and-psychodynamics">
<h2>Individuation and Psychodynamics<a class="headerlink" href="#individuation-and-psychodynamics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In Boyd and Meyers’s analysis of Mezirow’s work, they argue for an
explicitly psychoanalytical approach to Transformative Learning:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>A psychoanalytic view of Transformative Learning is seen as a process
of individuation, a lifelong journey of coming to understand oneself
through reflecting on the psychic structures (ego, shadow, persona,
collective unconscious, and so on) that make up an individual’s
identity. [&#64;boyd_transformative_1988]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>‘Individuation’ is Jung’s term for the process whereby the self emerges
from undifferentiated unconciousness. Although Jung uses different
terminology from Freud to identify the components of consciousness, the
essential concept of a dynamic relation between those components remains
the same. Putting the concept in terms of the previous discussion,
individuation is what happens when the uncertainty of the psyche is
balanced with the management of uncertainty of social relations.</p>
<p>This is also the definition of individuation developed by Simondon. He
sees the dynamics between the psyche and the world in terms of
transduction processes much in a similar way to that which Beer and
Bowlby describe, and which is shown in Figure
<a class="reference external" href="#ref:attach">[ref:attach]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”ref:attach”}. This is a continual process, and involves
transductions both inside (what he calls psychic individuation) and
outside (what he calls collective individuation) as Scott explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“Psychic and collective individuation incessantly and persistently
creates being as it advances, maintaining in each created or
individuated scope of being, hic et nunc, an operation of
individuation. After all, an individual exists and is only capable of
individuating as a result of the relations it establishes with others
and that others establish with it” [&#64;scott_gilbert_2014]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Where Simondon’s approach is particularly important lies in the fact
that his concept of transduction makes no separation between the psyche
and technology. Transductions occur at computer interfaces, between
individuals and institutions, between cells, or in conversations. Every
level of transduction is connected to every other. While Freud and Jung
concentrated on the linguistic transductions, Simondon’s awareness of
technology’s importance reminds us of the contexts within which our
utterances are formed. However, it is conversation which is the most
outward sign of an individuation process taking place.</p>
<p>These are not simply <em>educational</em> processes, but the processes of
personal growth entail the transductions that Simondon describes. This
frees us from rigid thinking about the stages of education within
particular institutions, and encourages us to consider the broader
context. The context of individual coordination is not only determined
by school or family. For example, the well-studied correlation between
economic constraints within the home and educational outcomes testifies
to the impact on personal growth of economic pressures - not only felt
in the way it directly impacts the individual, for example, through
child poverty - but in the indirect effects of economic pressure on
relationships in the home, perception of social position in a community,
access to good quality housing and healthcare, or the upholding of the
value of learning within the home. For this reason, the simplistic idea
of a ‘meritocracy’ based on educational success is blinkered: social and
economic circumstances render the playing field uneven from the
beginning, and the apportionment of social uncertainty is often the
direct consequence of government policy. Beck characterises this
apportioning of uncertainty as inequality in risk in society
[&#64;beck_risk_1992]: economic poverty gives families fewer options with
which they can manage uncertainty, and many of the means of managing
uncertainty, such as short-term loans, produce more uncertainty through
punitive repayment regimes. The consequence is increased anxiety and
damage to relations. That such policies which produce such inequalities
are conceived in a society is, in the final analysis, a failure of
education and a sign of a lack of individuation on the part of those in
power.</p>
<p>Here our questions about policy makers, pompous professors, status
acquisition and destructive power struggles within institutions all
point back to the fundamental question of higher learning and the
psychodynamics of creativity. When Illich criticises the production of
‘regimes of scarcity,’ he is identifying the result of a broken psyche -
what Beer characterises as the result of ‘homo faber’s’ untramelled
creation of new tools which threaten the enslavement of humanity
[&#64;beer_platform_1995]. The different ecologically-connected productions
of scarcity in society, from economics, housing, health, education and
knowledge produces scarcity of opportunity to develop as an organism
which is directly connected, as Bateson reminds us, to the ‘ecology of
mind’ [&#64;bateson_steps_1987]. In “Mind and Nature” [&#64;bateson_mind_2002],
Bateson highlights “The Cartesian dualism separating ‘mind’ and ‘matter’
” as one of the principal problems which render modern education
obsolete.</p>
<p>How then should we frame our questions about higher learning? The frame,
it seems, extends well-beyond the confines of the institution. A
coherent response to the question is indeed a challenge, and one which
goes unaddressed in the current research. In the educational discourse,
the effects of policy, economics or family are seen as separable factors
from the concerns about pedagogy in the classroom, or approaches to
learning. The principal value of a systems approach is that a coherent
approach may be found to addressing them. This approach must address
some fundamental questions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In what coherent ways can the different forms of constraint between
different stages of life and education be determined and studied?</p></li>
<li><p>How can the economic constraints be understood for their pedagogical
impact?</p></li>
<li><p>How might increasing financialisation and marketisation in higher
education be understood in terms of the psychodynamics of those who
support such policies and the effects of those who are subject to
them?</p></li>
<li><p>More broadly, what are the effects of education on human ontogeny in
those who acquire power to steer education for future generations?</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="scarcity-and-transduction">
<h2>Scarcity and Transduction<a class="headerlink" href="#scarcity-and-transduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>An holistic understanding of higher learning is possible. The preceding
discussion can be considered as describing transductions within the
psyche and how those transductions relate to communication patterns,
where both dimensions are managing their respective uncertainties. The
horizontal and vertical processes are similar to those discussed in
chapter 4, where we considered the vertical relations between the
components of an institution, and the horizontal relations between each
of those components and their environment.</p>
<p>The cybernetic response to bigger questions about society, economics and
education considers transduction processes at all levels. The
educational phenomena observed by scholars such as Bourdieu, Bernstein,
Wolf, Freire, Piaget or Bruner (to name a few) need to be situated
against the phenomena observed by economists and sociologists, and
alongside those observed by psychotherapists, artists and historians.
Each observed category is a manifestation of a transduction implicating
the observer, their discourse and the world they observe. This opens the
possibility of speculating about maps of transductions which cross the
boundaries of disciplines (which are themselves the result of
transductions at a higher level). Essentially the challenge lies in
explaining how what Illich calls the ‘regimes of scarcity’ emerge.</p>
<p>In modern western society, the arrival of a baby is accompanied with a
plethora of new objects. Prams, cots, bottles, blankets, baby-grows,
nappies, mobiles and teddy bears are the beginning. TV and interactive
technologies are having an impact at an earlier and earlier age. For the
parents, the acquisition of these objects is a signal that their world
has changed, and their relationship to one another must now focus on the
child. The objects mediate the attachment relation between parent and
child as shown in Figure
<a class="reference external" href="#ref:objattach">[ref:objattach]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”ref:objattach”}, but they also represent declarations of
scarcity where the uncertainty of child-rearing is addressed with
products, brands and marketing.</p>
<p>The distinction that arises in Bowlby’s attachment theory has two sides:
on the one hand, proximity manages the uncertainty of the organism’s
environment; on the other, the systemic need to maintain proximity
declares the scarcity of the object of attachment: just as in economics,
what is <em>scarce</em> is also <em>precious</em>. Although Illich’s criticism is that
scarcity is artificially declared throughout education, scarcity is
implicit in the very process of drawing the most basic distinction in
biological processes.</p>
<p>This is not to say however, that the caregiver is a ‘resource.’ This was
Freud’s view of the mother-baby relation which Bowlby argued against,
saying that the caregiver has a symbiotic relationship with the child,
revealed when proximity is maintained by an abundance of love and care -
an overwhelming multiplicity of sensory descriptions. The transduction
between parent and child is so powerful because of the richness of the
intersubjective relation and the flexibility and responsiveness of the
‘conversational’ dance.</p>
<p>This dance is mediated, as Winnicott observed [&#64;winnicott_playing_2005]
through objects: the breast or the bottle, the baby’s dummy or a
favourite toy. The world of object relations to the child is different
from those of the parents. To parents, baby buggies, feeding bottles,
sterilisers, nappies and so on are scarce objects: every parent is led
to believe there is a right way to bring up their child with the right
stuff. Consequently, every manoeuvre with a small child is a negotiation
around material artefacts and emotions. Every negotiation must be
coordinated against social expectations and the affordances of a world
which is unsympathetic to the demands on parents dealing with the early
development of children. This is a process which continues as children
grow older. Objects become important as a strategy for parents to occupy
the developing minds of children: toys and games and electronic devices
mediate the developing attachment relation. Some objects become tools
for experimentation and exploration.</p>
<p>Objects mediate relations between people. Stages of development are
distinguished by different kinds of objects, but more importantly,
stages of development are distinguished by different objects in the
<em>company of others</em>. The objects with which one learns to read and
write, books, films and other tools of inculcation into a society become
important in the child’s relation with the world. In the developmental
process, the intersubjective conversational coordination around objects
becomes closely associated with proximity to those objects. From here,
notions of provision of ‘good’ and ‘bad’ objects can give rise to
notions of privilege, personal worth, and ‘good’ and ‘bad’ education.</p>
<p>Parents and children become accustomed to the paraphernalia of objects.
They become accustomed to a world view which declares scarcity: the
scarcity of entertainment, the scarcity of knowledge, the scarcity of
friendship, the scarcity of time, of space and so on. Each object which
declares scarcity opens doors onto new things which also are scarce: for
example, modern computer games and apps generate artificial desires and
needs in children leading them to pester their parents to spend money on
them to keep the kids happy! Fads are established around objects -
whether skateboards, favourite music, football stickers and so on, each
making a claim to scarcity. Inquiry and conversation between friends
mediated by objects leads to the discovery both of new objects and new
ideas. The world opens-up from one ‘secret garden’ to another.</p>
<p>Language gives people the power to declare their own objects. It gives
them the ability to explore ways in which new social coordinations might
uphold or change existing coordinations. Slowly we move from relations
with objects and parents into a world of discourse and friends and
colleagues. Bodies and hearts formed by early childhood find new
discursive expression. Early behaviour and object relations gradually
translate into political beliefs, social groupings, and other practices.
The formation of expectations, and the mastery of skill are fundamental
to these processes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="school">
<h2>School<a class="headerlink" href="#school" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The difference in orientation between the school and the university is
highlighted in the relationship these institutions have to the objects
they structure their activities around. Educational processes and events
are mediated through objects: not just books, computers and pencils, but
bodies, hands, eyes, and so on. The skilled performances of hands in
manipulating tools, or instruments is essential to the kind of practical
mastery upon which deeper intellectual insight depends. Body movements
and behaviours become objectified within educational schemas along with
the tools with which bodies have to perform. Unexpected body movements,
uncontrolled gestures can have real impacts which in turn can be
upsetting and sometimes dangerous.</p>
<p>At any level of education, unfamiliar situations where retraining bodies
is necessary can be anything but cosy. In such a situation, there are
networks of expectations, rights, responsibilities shared by both
teachers and learners: the ‘right’ way to use such-and-such a tool,
awareness of dangerous practices or the provision of safe environments.
Lack of predictability in the behaviour of objects, and the behaviour of
bodies causes particular kinds of objects to be handled in particular
kinds of ways. Comparing the practices of schooling, where the behaviour
of individuals might be less predictable, with the practices of
university - where they might be expected to be more predictable -
suggests that expectations associated with different environments can
create very different kinds of conversation.</p>

<h2>Objects and Discourse in the School and the University<a class="headerlink" href="#objects-and-discourse-in-the-school-and-the-university" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If there is a principal difference between objects in the schoolroom and
objects in the university, it is that the school reinforces discourse
through objects and practices, whereas the university sets about a
process of turning objects and practices into discourse.</p>
<p>In the school science classroom for example, a <em>wheatstone bridge</em> is an
object for teaching electronics whose descriptions in textbooks and exam
papers reinforce the identity of the object and ensure that on being
questioned about the nature of the object, the students’ responses will
be uniform. Higher learning often (but not always) turns objects into
questions: what is <em>resistance</em> really? Is current really a flow of
electrons? Might electric charge be due to something else?</p>
<p>In the school, objects codify expectations about knowledge. The objects
of the schoolroom are standardised for everyone: the chairs, tables,
blackboard, pens, exercise books, readers and increasingly iPads and
computers are designed to produce equivalent experiences for each child.
Like the objects of the hospital, school objects are surrounded with
standardised protocols and procedures, rights and responsibilities which
carry meaning for the various stakeholders who work with them. Around
each object there are rules which apply to each child: each rule is
generally intended to limit the unpredictability of the child’s
responses to the different artefacts. The school situation is
characterised by potentially large variety in the learner’s response to
diverse objects. Reproduction of objects and their rules helps in
reinforcing norms of behaviour amongst a large number of children whose
sheer number and diversity would otherwise produce management problems.</p>
<p>In codifying expectations about knowledge, the objects of the classroom
also encode rights and obligations of stakeholders, and to some extent
the legitimate activities that may be performed with them. The rights
and obligations of teachers in relation to these objects is reflected in
professional performance indicators which measure the extent to which
they handle classroom resources, curriculum delivery, and the lesson
plan.</p>
<p>Not all approaches to schooling reproduce this hegemony of objects. The
most subversive pedagogical techniques turn objects into discourse. The
radical pedagogies of Freire [&#64;freire_pedagogy_1996], Boal
[&#64;boal_theatre_2008] or Shor [&#64;shor_critical_1987] are exemplified by a
process of taking material reality as a question about freedom and
coercion in the lives of students. This stimulates learners early on to
make their own declarations about the constitution of the world, and to
challenge those ideas which are imposed upon them, often by formal
education. Another way of turning objects into discourse is to place
more emphasis on play, focusing on the articulation of experiences,
emotions and exploration.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, experiments in radical pedagogy in schools are not
mainstream. Increasing emphasis on testing, targets and qualifications
has produced an environment where it is increasingly difficult to find
the necessary space for play or challenge to authority. This
institutional reaction by schools and government probably has similar
roots to the increasing conservativism of the university: it is a
reaction by governments, schools, parents and many teachers to an
environment of increasing uncertainty. It enlists objects as tools for
reinforcing the status quo: a situation which begs for change once
learners reach university.</p>
<p>University potentially offers students a greater diversity of objects to
engage with, encouraging them to find their own articulations of what
objects mean, and how they are connected. In this process, students
begin to make their own declarations about the world: to create their
own ‘objects’ in discourse. In doing so, they may well encounter some of
the ‘troubling’ that is discussed by Land and others, and gain what
Young calls ‘epistemic access.’ But in this process, the university
engages in a different form of objectification - once which has
increasingly become associated with status and money.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="discourse-and-money-in-the-university">
<h2>Discourse and Money in the University<a class="headerlink" href="#discourse-and-money-in-the-university" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If the process of higher learning is to turn objects into discourse,
formalised patterns of practice within the discourse can create new
kinds of objects. Publication in high-status journals can lead to
high-status and high-salary jobs in the university; authorship of
patents produces commercial opportunities for institutions and
collaborations with industry can bring lucrative contracts; Degree
certificates, academic prizes, sporting success and artistic
accomplishment also have a status as sought-after objects. University
converts its objects to discourse on the one hand, but in recent years
has proceeded to convert discourse back into objects with monetary and
status value. The university also invests in new kinds of physical
objects for science - mass spectrometers, DNA sequencers, electron
microscopes, MRI scanners, quantum computers and other paraphernalia of
modern science - which are objects unlike the objects of the schoolroom.
They are instead tools for opening up new interventions in the
discourse: the possession of a quantum computer or a DNA sequencer is an
opportunity for publishing more papers.</p>
<p>The objects of the university are diverse where the school objects are
uniform. Where the behavioural unpredictability of children and the
teacher’s concern for safety and coordination might have dominated the
practices in the school, the university embraces diversity and
unpredictability as a way of making effective interventions in the
discourse. The university can claim to be the custodian of its academics
who are the ‘queens and kings of a discourse’ and consequently can
coordinate the discursive development of their students. In practical
subjects - most notably medical education, but equally various forms of
computer-related design - mastery over the transformation of objects
becomes an educational objective, which in turn demands control of
physical dispositions and rational awareness of the nature of the task
and the tools. Of itself, the acquisition of skill alone may not be
higher learning, but the requirement that students reflect on their
development is specifically aimed at turning physical skill into
discourse, which is.</p>
<p>The diversity of objects and people in the university invites students
to encounter and challenge their expectations of the world. Each object
presents a question: sophisticated mathematical modelling tools,
medieval manuscripts, cadavers, musical instruments and library
catalogues potentially offer an opportunity to ‘unsettle’ prevailing
expectations. Equally, the encounter with theologians, mathematicians,
physicists, engineers and musicians provides an opportunity to converse
with those whose higher learning journey has given them a different
descriptions coordinated in different ways. Furthermore, irrespective of
the disciplinary background, conversation also leads to encounters with
racism, sexism, religious fanaticism, and other forms of bigotry.
Discourse plays the lead role in creating the means to make new
declarations about objects and ideas. Even when some transformations
result in new kinds of object: e.g. pictures, sculptures, performances,
pieces of software, videos, being able to say something about it, to
make a new declaration about something and to coordinate a conversation
around it lies at the heart of meaning.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="objects-and-uncertainty">
<h2>Objects and Uncertainty<a class="headerlink" href="#objects-and-uncertainty" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>From a cybernetic perspective, an object is a stabilisation of
observation. In the perceptual theory of Heinz von Foerster, for
example, an object is characterised as a stabilised recursive pattern
between perception and the world called an <em>Eigenform</em>
[&#64;von_foerster_understanding_2003]. We see ‘chairs’ not because there
are mind-independent chairs, but because between the constraints of
perception, language, culture and the environment, coherence can be
established in seeing, pointing at, talking about, and sitting on a
chair. Another way of putting it is to say that the chair is the result
of transduction between perception and its environment. Such coherence
can be disrupted if expectations about ‘chairness’ are not met (for
example, the chair collapses upon sitting on it), or a holographic chair
reveals itself to be immaterial. What happens in such cases is that
uncertainties which the stabilised object can absorb, reappear requiring
new distinctions to be made (a <em>broken</em> chair, a hologram).</p>
<p>Gordon Pask saw concepts in a similar way: a concept was a stabilisation
in discourse - in itself, a kind of object. Therefore, to convert
objects to discourse is really to transform one kind of object into
another, the difference between them being that one is more mutable that
the other. Transformation of concepts can be achieved through argument
whose function is to highlight uncertainties not addressed by existing
concepts, and therefore requiring a reconfiguration of the discourse.</p>
<p>This idea may be seen in the light of the earlier discussion about
psychodynamics. Objects mediate discourse by making a connection between
perceptual transductions (those between Ego and Id, for example) and the
transductions of conversation. It is in this way that we reveal our
inner selves through our engagement with objects. Schutz’s ‘pure
We-relation’ that was discussed in chapter 3, lies in the rich and
complex coordination processes between individuals, objects and the
world. The capacity to manipulate computer objects means that the ways
this coordination occurs is changing and creates new possibilities,
which in turn contextualises the reaction of the university to the
consequent increases in uncertainty about communication.</p>
<p>The reaction of the modern university’s hierarchical structures is to
ramp-up its own objectification processes. The reinforcement of
authority in respected journals is an attenuation of new possibilities
for communication (for example, blogging or the use of online video)
which might disrupt any kind of discursive coherence. The university is
in tension as a place of reflexivity which turns its objects into
conversations, and as a place of actions which turns its conversations
into objects with monetary value. Degree certificates, statistics on
graduate salaries and employability, league table rankings, high-status
publications and patents are all manifestations of this
re-objectification.</p>
<p>The university’s approach to managing the tension depends on its
interpretation of its own environment. In an environment of extreme
uncertainty, the interpretation of that environment is subject to
attenuative forces which seek to render uncertainty manageable. Is the
university’s environment a <em>market</em> into which it must sell what it
makes? Or is the university’s environment society as a whole, for which
it serves multiple (and sometimes nebulous) functions?</p>
<p>The market in education is a powerful lens through which the
uncertainties of the environment may be viewed. Whilst it is blinkered
to reduced everything to money, it is not surprising to see most modern
universities seeing themselves as operating in a market, and guiding
their activities accordingly (encouraged by government which suffers the
same reaction to uncertainty). The consequences of the market
orientation set in place an approach to uncertainty which favours
objectification as an operating principle. The consequence of this is
that the mechanisms and structures of the university which manufacture
objects, including modules, learning outcomes, certificates, patents and
papers, are reinforced. Increasingly, these functions are tuned to
market demands, with new processes of objectification feeding in to the
process in the form of league tables, and other forms of status-related
information. Management of uncertainty in the environment is gradually
replaced with a coordination of expectations at all levels of the
education system: objectification goes hand-in-hand with scarcity, and
the best university is coveted by parents who believe only the best
school will prepare their children for entry. Increasingly, market
mechanisms become the attenuators of uncertainty.</p>

<h2>The Endosymbiotic Global University<a class="headerlink" href="#the-endosymbiotic-global-university" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is likely that technology will eventually provide new forms of
transduction of communication whose uncertainties the traditional
university will not be able to adapt to. It may be AI or Virtual Reality
or Blockchain or even telepathy, but the complexity and richness of
transductions through technology will eventually destabilise the
established order. In the event of this, the critical question is how
does society transform its process of higher learning? How does it
support the creative individuation process of individuals turning
objects into discourse?</p>
<p>This is really a question about the relationship between the environment
and global higher learning. Universities, like cells, have shown
tendencies for endosymbiotic development [&#64;margulis_symbiotic_1998].
That is, over time, they absorb elements from their environment just as
cells contain mitochondria which (according to Margulis) used to be
independent organisms. By this process, an individual university
acquires the local art school, or practices emerging at the fringes of
society like jazz gradually become transformed into subjects on the
curriculum. The adaptation of institutions is tied-up with their social
environment. Equally, the adaptation of individuals as they engage in
the individuation of higher learning is also a process of acquiring
flexibility to act by absorbing elements from the environment.</p>
<p>So, if the institution of higher learning is endosymbiotic, what happens
with technology? Although social technology is in its infancy, it also
shows endosymbiotic features in its development. The dominion of the
computer prevails over the research practices of almost all disciplines
today. So far this takeover has been kept separate from the institution
of education’s processes of assessment, and its according of status and
intellectual authority to academics. But for how much longer? Already
bibliometrics is used as a crude marker of intellectual status, and it
may well be that over time, practices of assessment and the conferring
of awards involve global technologies which make the distinctions
between one institution’s practices and another’s impossible to defend.
One of the drivers for change may lie in the current pathology of
academic status that exists in the academy in its awkward relationship
with uncertainty where what Fromm calls ‘irrational authority’ prevails
in corridors of academic power over ‘rational authority’:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Rational authority is based on competence, and it helps the person who
leans on it to grow. Irrational authority is based on power and serves
to exploit the person subjected to it. [&#64;fromm_have_2013 68]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In the wake of rising uncertainty, universities have produced
increasingly irrational authorities: from senior management teams
devising crazy plans for ‘institutional change’ to ambitious individuals
who covet academic titles for their own sake, status has become
pathological. In the process rational authority can find itself
squeezed-out by irrational authority, particularly if the latter sees it
as a threat. It is into this gap that technology is likely to step,
providing the space for rational authority, and gradually challenging
the status of irrational authority.</p>
<p>There are signs that this is starting to happen. The use of email
listservs and online forums by scientists from across the world to
discuss their work replaces what used to happen in cloisters and coffee
bars. Moreover, technology affords opportunities for creative expression
which cut deeper than the stilted forms of approved publication. Yet the
university remains the custodian of books, manuscripts, students,
academics, spaces, technologies for research and their own history. As
organisms themselves, universities will adapt to their uncertain
environment. But that adaptation will only be successful if universities
seek to understand their environment better.</p>
<p>Since the environment is suffused with technologies which afford a
similar function to higher learning, the best strategy for future
viability is to amplify the environment of technology, understand how
individuals can exploit technology to manage their own uncertainty
outside the institution, and then to think about those aspects of the
task of managing uncertainty which still require institutional
structures to maintain them (for example, an archive or a library).</p>
<p>In the future, those tasks which remain critical to the institution’s
viability are unlikely to be printing degree certificates, validating
modules or writing learning outcomes. They are more likely to involve
continually studying the environment of education, coordinating and
monitoring political ecologies, observing and cataloguing discourse,
providing a home for those who wish to think, preserving knowledge,
identifying societal threats and making recommendations for effective
intervention. In each case, the university’s function is to manage
uncertainty by converting observations of dynamic processes into objects
of discourse which feed into those processes.</p>

<h1><em><strong>Part 4</strong></em> Making Education Better {#part-4-making-education-better .unnumbered}<a class="headerlink" href="#part-4-making-education-better-part-4-making-education-better-unnumbered" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The critical question which remains to be addressed concerns the
practicalities of implementing better education. Part 4 considers the
problems and challenges of educational research as necessary groundwork
for making improvements. Few people would argue that the objective of
educational research is to make education better by increasing knowledge
about what happens in education and developing new practice. Often,
however, educational researchers have to meet bureaucratic demands that
measure the quality and impact of their publications, where the concrete
developments in classrooms and institutions which are felt by staff and
students are of secondary importance.</p>
<p>The difficulty of the challenge is also a factor: on what foundation
could educators agree what needs to be done? How could educators
coordinate concerted action in their institutions to make education fit
the needs of society? With what methods might justifiable knowledge
claims about education be made? These questions concern both methodology
in educational research and the practical ways in which large-scale
improvements might be coordinated through small-scale interventions.</p>
<p>Chapter 11 concerns methodology. It argues that the complex nature of
educational phenomena necessitate an ‘analytical’ approach to research.
Most educational research (and indeed most research in all disciplines)
is not analytical, but synthetic: it attempts to arrive at new
explanations and knowledge by co-opting existing theories and methods in
explaining new observed phenomena. The analytic approach considers all
observed phenomena as epiphenomena arising from the operation of simple
generative mechanisms. Chapter 11 argues that the coordination of
research efforts can be achieved through the coordinated inspection of
generative mechanisms, and the collective perception of unity in
diversity. As part of this process, there needs to be a coherent way of
understanding the different ways in which research is understood:
different perspectives on education - whether critical, functionalist or
phenomenological - must at some point arise from some originating
source. In this way, what can sometimes appear to be tribal behaviours
in educational research can be seen to be coherent and explicable at a
deeper level.</p>
<p>Chapter 12 illustrates a more analytical approach to education research,
drawing on the work of psychotherapist Marion Milner in the 1930s.
Milner’s book “The Human Problem in Schools” provides an example of
analysis which directly focuses on the deep generative mechanisms from
which educational phenomena arise. Milner’s mechanisms are described in
terms of Jungian psychoanalysis, but by using the cybernetic techniques
developed in this book, it is shown how her descriptions may be seen in
a more coherent way in terms of ‘structures of transductions.’ With
understanding of the different transductions of a system of
inter-relating human concerns, small-scale interventions can be examined
to see the ways in which practices, categories and distinctions change.</p>

<h2>Tribal loyalties and Educational Values<a class="headerlink" href="#tribal-loyalties-and-educational-values" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Increasing uncertainty in society makes distinctions harder to draw:
recent concerns about ‘fake news’ and confirmation bias online provide
simple examples of the effects of this. However, uncertainty may have
some positive side-effects. Within much of the discourse in the social
sciences, including education, there are different groups that have
developed distinct identities and values in their approach to research.
While increasing uncertainty might initially cause groups to assert
their identity more strongly (as indeed, has been the effect of
confirmation bias online), eventually, uncertainty means that
distinctions become blurred and almost impossible to uphold.</p>
<p>In the social science discourse, a example is the distinction between
the positions of ‘functionalism,’ ‘phenomenology’ and ‘critical theory.’
Each of these has a pseudo-definition which situates it against
competing paradigms. Functionalism, for example, is an approach to the
study of the phenomena of social life which “distinguishes structure
from processes,” and “attempts to pursue a unified methodological
approach to uncover underlying mechanistic, or organic processes”
[&#64;burrell_sociological_1982]. Cybernetics itself is often considered to
be functionalist, although it would be more accurate to say that
cybernetics can be turned towards functionalist ends (and sometimes is)
inasmuch as it can be turned towards critical or phenomenological ends.</p>
<p>The 19^th^ century advocates of functionalism in sociology, who included
Comte, Spencer and Durkheim, believed that a better society would arise
from a clearer understanding of mechanism underpinning society’s
complexity. The application of mechanistic scientific thinking to
complex social problems was part of this approach: ultimately,
functionalists believe there is no division between the hard sciences
like physics and the social sciences like education.</p>
<p>Those who criticise this approach come from different traditions.
Critical theorists will point out the naivety of the functionalist’s
assumptions, and moreover identify that within those assumptions lie the
roots of oppression: functionalists (among whom are more than a few
learning technologists and educational innovators!) may believe they
have created a better world, but there are inevitably people who lose
out in the wake of innovation.</p>
<p>Phenomenologists and existentialists - grouped together partly because
of the close relationship between Heideggarian phenomenology and French
existentialism, identify in functionalism a failure to grasp the
complexity of human consciousness and experience. Functionalists, they
argue, tend to see people like robots, devoid of feelings and ready to
be plugged-in to some new techno-system of their invention. Some
sociologists, like Talcott Parsons or Niklas Luhmann, wish to account
for these deeper phenomenological concepts from a systems standpoint,
but for the phenomenologist critics of functionalism, these attempts to
embrace the study of consciousness within functionalism are deficient.</p>
<p>The consequence of these different positions is that research into
education is ‘tribal’: supporters of functionalist approaches will work
on technology projects and publish in journals which are largely read
and supported by academics with a similar orientation, whilst supporters
of ‘critical’ approaches to education will publish in different
journals. Phenomenological and existential inquiries into education tend
to exist at the boundaries between education and philosophy. Sometimes
even these broad positions split into factions of researchers.</p>
<p>So the question, “How should education be made better?” becomes “better
for whom?” or “better in whose eyes?” Is there a concept of “better”
which everyone can agree? The problem appears intractable. And yet, if
we were to inquire into the roots of this tribalism - which is to adopt
a meta-description - we would note that the discourse forms against the
context of institutions themselves, their publishing practices, the
methodologies and ideas about education which have become enshrined in
PhD programmes, and the fundamental unfairness which has been introduced
into the education system. We might even note that the splits and
bifurcations in the discourse only really serve the interests of those
in power in institutions: without a coherent line of research for
improvement then the status and position of powerful people remains
unchallenged in any meaningful way. The meta-description should be able
to account for the critical aspects which give rise to tribalism, the
phenomenological aspects of consciousness and provide a deeper
mechanistic description of multiplicity of values, practices,
experiences and understanding which results.</p>
<p>One of the objectives of this book has been to coordinate multiple
perspectives of education through a particular methodological and
theoretical lens. No claim has been made that this lens or approach is
correct - only that the different aspects under consideration can be
approached consistently. The value of a cybernetic approach is that it
is generative of possibilities. Some of those possibilities might be
realised, or realisable at different levels, and others not. But the
fundamental essence of the inquiry is cosmological: it is about a
meta-language with which the complex specific phenomena of the world can
be discussed. So the question is more about the underlying directional
motivation with which research inquiries are pursued.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="from-synthesis-to-analysis">
<h2>From Synthesis to Analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#from-synthesis-to-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The tribalism of education research arises from a way of thinking about
research more generally. The predominant mode of research across most
disciplines - not only education - is synthesis. A synthetic approach to
research is one which gathers evidence from a variety of empirical
situations and attempts to fit an explanatory framework over the
perceived phenomena. The problem with synthesis is that the perception
of phenomena is an epiphenomenon of underlying mechanisms. In order to
comprehend what those underlying mechanisms are, one has to see beyond
what is perceived. The synthetic approach dominates most of what goes by
the name of ‘research’ in universities, and in many fields it has been
unsuccessful. In physics, for example, the attempt to combine existing
theories of basic forces into a unified theory has been the goal for
many generations of physicists. In particular, the attempt to unify
quantum mechanics with relativity has so far eluded conclusive success.
In biology, the problem is worse: synthesis leads to a variety of
specialised theories concerning epigenetics and genetics. As with
physics, nothing coherent has yet emerged, and indeed there remains
little explanation for the ways in which cells organise to produce
hearts, brains and fingers. In medicine, synthetic methods gather
evidence of ‘markers’ for disease from genetics, neurology,
endocrinology, and so on, and then seek to explain disease through the
presence of these markers.</p>
<p>Research efforts into learning and education (of which biological,
physical and physiological theories are a subset) have similarly pursued
a synthetic approach, and similarly lack coherence and explanatory
power. However, the reason for the lack of progress in educational
research is often given that it is a different kind of inquiry to that
of physics or biology, and that it cannot attain the rigour and
precision of the physical sciences. Yet education has largely followed
medicine in seeking ‘markers’ for success and failure, often attempting
to identify a particular pedagogy or technology as the independent
variable in educational improvement, and even inviting calls that it
should, like pharmacology, adopt randomised control trials. The
synthetic approach to research provides little coherence in research
activities in <em>any</em> science. In this sense, the failure of educational
research is no different from the failure of physics or biology. What is
needed instead is an <em>analytical</em> approach.</p>
<p>Figure <a class="reference external" href="#ref:rowlands">[ref:rowlands]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”ref:rowlands”}, reproduced from Rowland’s work on physics,
represents what he sees as the difference between synthesis and analysis
in science [&#64;rowlands_fundamental_2017]. Where synthesis gathers
together manifest observations, analysis considers the fundamental
nature of perception itself and speculates on the possible relations
which might connect the perceiver with the perceived. The history of
science is peppered with major breakthroughs brought about through
analysis, not synthesis. It is from one of the early instances of
analytical thought - that of Copernicus - that we call the discoveries
of Newton, Einstein, Boltzmann, or Bohr ‘Copernican.’ Einstein’s early
thought experiments about relativity are a classic example of the power
of speculative imagination to overturn institutionalised scientific
dogma.</p>
<p>Where the synthetic mode supports an institutionalised scientific labour
which is regulated, rigorous, apparently precise, the analytic mode
belongs to insight, intuition, imagination and creativity. The synthetic
mode attempts to carve-up observations into cognate fields, often
drawing-up spurious boundaries of convenience so that the perceived
phenomena can be analysed more easily. By contrast, the analytic
approach looks for connections across boundaries and underlying patterns
which indicate common mechanisms.</p>
<p>A synthetic approach to educational research has to generate
distinctions which separate those cognate observations which will be
synthesized from factors related to those observations which are deemed
to lie outside the domain of inquiry. Yet education is essentially
transdisciplinary, and its basic function involves the making of
distinctions. An analytical approach to education must seek connections
from the basic processes of perception to the development of
distinction-making capabilities which underpin the construction of the
identities of individuals and the reproduction of society and its
education system.</p>

<div class="section" id="synthesis-and-educational-technology-research">
<h2>Synthesis and Educational Technology Research<a class="headerlink" href="#synthesis-and-educational-technology-research" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Research into uses of technology in education technology provides a good
example of a synthetic approach to science. This discourse often takes
the form of advocacy for the use of new tools, learning designs or
pedagogical approaches which (it is claimed) produce improved
educational results. Advocacy is usually accompanied with some kind of
grounding in existing theory or methodology. The mode of argument is to
appeal for the validity of research findings on the basis of assumed
coherence with whatever underlying theory and methodology is chosen.
Despite the sometimes hollow ring of research claims, publication
nevertheless contributes to the public profile of researchers, serving
the function of gaining citations and establishing reputation with
associated technologies or approaches for which authors can become
thought-leaders. Feyerabend noted this aspect of ‘gurudom’ which can
attract the promoters of the latest fashion across many fields of
inquiry. He was the first to point to the disruptive role of ego in all
kinds of research remarking that:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Experts have a vested interest in their own playpens, and so they will
quite naturally argue that ‘education’ is impossible without them (can
you imagine an Oxford philosopher, or an elementary particle physicist
arguing himself out of good money?) [&#64;feyerabend_against_2010]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Equally, why would advocates of a new technology in education point to
the the holes in their methods or epistemologies? The advocacy of
technology in education is often established according to the answers to
simple questions like: Have more students passed or got higher grades?
Have students been happier? Have fewer dropped off the course? These
indicators are usually generated through standardised methodologies in
the social sciences, for example, qualitative methods like ‘Grounded
Theory’ or quantitative methods which seek to establish statistical
correlations between interventions and outcomes.</p>
<p>Philosophical objections to such research approaches are not difficult
to make: all social theories and methodologies for investigation carry
with them implicit ontological assumptions about how the world is as
Mingers, following Bhaskar, has argued
[&#64;mingers_realising_2006; &#64;bhaskar_possibility_1979]. Whilst studies
seek to establish the administration of technology as an ‘independent
variable’ in the production of ‘better learning,’ or the ascription of
statistical hypotheses, p-values and so on, in each case, it appears as
if a pretence of objective science overrides common sense considerations
of the variability of human behaviour or the dependence on context. The
presence of many journals of ‘educational technology’ speak both of the
industrialisation of education and of the socio-economic mechanisms
which now surround academic publishing (as part of that
industrialisation process) which demand academics and learning
technologists in universities publish. What it doesn’t do is address any
coherent attempt to advance insight and understanding of technology in
education: how does education actually get any better as a result of it?</p>
<p>This is not to say that a deeper insight into the relationship between
education and technology is not possible. In order to address this, a
realignment of critical method, technological approach, experiment, the
communication of results and scholarly debate is required. Technology
plays a fundamental role in all of these. Why write papers about
technological innovation in education using a medium which is little
changed since the 17^th^ century? Why research practices in institutions
whilst ignoring the vast array of social, economic and material
constraints within which those practices occur? Why argue for ‘better
learning’ without asking what is meant in the first place? Why write
critical papers on the state of universities if criticisms do nothing to
stem the financialisation of the education system, the systematic
closure of unpopular subjects (like philosophy), the growing
inequalities in the treatment of academic staff, and enormous rises in
the costs of education to students?</p>

<h2>Tweaking the Transducers<a class="headerlink" href="#tweaking-the-transducers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In Chapter 1 the difficulty of making distinctions in education was
explored. All research concerns itself with the inspection and sometimes
the adjustment of distinctions (Deleuze’s description of philosophy as
the “continuous creation of concepts” [&#64;deleuze_what_1994]is a good
example of this): awareness of transduction processes highlights how
distinctions come to be drawn. In the research discourse, assumed
categories and their relations may come under the spotlight and
suggestions made for their reconception, or new phenomena are produced
which invite the creation of new distinctions. Through the development
of technologies, new distinctions and practices emerge with regard to
processes of teaching, learning or organisation. It is through such
intellectual and social processes that we have e-Portfolio, MOOCs,
Bitcoin, Adaptive content, Flipped classrooms and social media. In
Simondon’s language [&#64;simondon_mode_2017], this is a process of
‘concretisation’ of these technologies through transduction, and as part
of this in all contexts research efforts are bounded by areas where
distinctions are not considered: there are always assumptions about
‘epistemology’ or ‘ontology’ which are either untouched by research, or
are revealed in relief against the background of the research. Their
identification by others (who might critique the absence of attention on
assumptions) amounts to another set of distinctions.</p>
<p>Methodologies for investigation also carry assumptions about the nature
of the world, the nature of education, ethical and political biases
which require exploration. They are also the product of transduction, as
are the increasing array of sophisticated statistical tools designed to
analyse text from questionnaires and interviews whose results form the
basis of much reported research work.</p>
<p>Transductions occur at various levels: at the very least we might
distinguish transductions of perception and transductions of language.
The transductions performed by technologies seem to fall between the
two: technical change is rather like ‘art’ (the latinized word for the
Greek <em>technics</em>). Like art, technologies present changes of perception
and invite changes in language to describe them.</p>
<p>Possibly because of the in-betweenness of educational technological
interventions, the methodological and technical approaches to
educational research appear inconsistent in their ontological and
epistemological assumptions. It is difficult to find a coherent view
regarding the question: “If this technology really works (as researcher
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> might claim), and its underlying theory is correct, what would the
world look like?” Equally it is difficult to unpick a possible answer to
this question and challenge it with: “how does your model of the world
differ from the world as it actually is?” More often than not, there are
manifest inconsistencies when addressing these kinds of questions:
conceptual vocabulary is used in different and inconsistent ways, where
the meaning of a concept slips from one thing to another as an attempt
at a coherent explanation is made.</p>
<p>Research is a learning process. Research into anything is a process of
inspecting, playing with and adjusting transductions. As transductions
are adjusted at one level, so transductions are altered at another. The
initial impulse for inquiry is usually the result of an encounter with a
puzzle or some perceived uncertainty. The researcher may defend a
particular approach drawing on various assumptions, some of which they
will inspect and others they won’t. As interventions are made, and as
concepts are invented, some fundamental transductions will inevitably
shift in their relation to others. It is through this process that some
of the basic concepts of society like ‘education,’ ‘ethics,’ ‘faith’ or
‘truth’ are both generated and become very slippery.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="slippery-concepts">
<h2>Slippery Concepts<a class="headerlink" href="#slippery-concepts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Do the different ‘tribes’ of educational research arise through a deeper
process which underpins not only the way we think about science,
research and education, or the way we organise its discourse, but in the
way that consciousness itself works? The problem of ‘slippery concepts’
was first faced by David Hume, who was interested in the way that
arguments about ethics - about what <em>ought</em> to be the case - related to
questions about fact - what <em>is</em> the case. Hume’s argument is worth
inspecting partly because the distinction between <em>is</em> and <em>ought</em>
remains a fundamental distinction in educational research and the
expression of ‘value,’ and also that in attempting to explain what Hume
calls the slippage between <em>is</em> and <em>ought</em> insight can be gained into
how other distinctions which cement tribal behaviour are similarly
slippery.</p>
<p>Hume complained of the ease with which an argument about what ‘<em>is</em>’ the
case slips into an argument about what ‘<em>ought to be</em>’ the case:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“In every system of morality, which I have hitherto met with, I have
always remarked, that the author proceeds for some time in the
ordinary ways of reasoning, and establishes the being of a God, or
makes observations concerning human affairs; when all of a sudden I am
surprised to find, that instead of the usual copulations of
propositions, is, and is not, I meet with no proposition that is not
connected with an ought, or an ought not. This change is
imperceptible; but is however, of the last consequence. For as this
ought, or ought not, expresses some new relation or affirmation, ‘tis
necessary that it should be observed and explained; and at the same
time that a reason should be given; for what seems altogether
inconceivable, how this new relation can be a deduction from others,
which are entirely different from it. But as authors do not commonly
use this precaution, I shall presume to recommend it to the readers;
and am persuaded, that this small attention would subvert all the
vulgar systems of morality, and let us see, that the distinction of
vice and virtue is not founded merely on the relations of objects, nor
is perceived by reason” [&#64;hume_enquiry_2007]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Jumping forwards 200 years and we meet slippery concepts in a different
guise. Warren McCulloch was interested in the logical properties of
neural nets. He argued that considering the way that the brain consisted
of neurons wired together in a heterarchical fashion, the idea that
logic was a matter of ‘true’ and ‘false’ with nothing in-between did not
make sense (the ‘Law of the Excluded Middle’). He presented a diagram in
which he sought to explain the circular complexity of mental processes
and the ways in which Aristotelian logic breaks down in circular neural
logic. McCulloch presents a diagram similar to Figure
<a class="reference external" href="#ref:mcculloch1">11.1</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”ref:mcculloch1”}.</p>
<p><img alt="The 'is-ought' gap presented within the context of McCulloch's modelof perception as multiple levels of interconnectedtransduction" src="_images/mcculloch1.jpg" />{#ref:mcculloch1 width=”\textwidth”}</p>
<p>In Figure <a class="reference external" href="#ref:mcculloch1">11.1</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”ref:mcculloch1”} shows an adaptation of McCulloch’s diagram
detailing four loops. The outer two loops represent two aspects of the
environment of thought: one for the ‘inside and now’ and the other for
the ‘outside and then.’ The inner two loops represent Hume’s ‘is’ and
‘ought.’ we might say that arguments about ‘is’ and ‘ought’ result from
varying degrees of excitation among these loops. To make an argument
about ‘is’ is to have the ‘is’ loop excited more than the ‘ought’ loop,
and vice-versa. Excitation of one loop results in suppression of the
other loops, while each loop excites itself and suppresses the other
loops. What might cause one loop to be activated and the other to be
suppressed? There will be unspecified processes both inside and outside
that could potentially cause this to change over time.</p>
<p>Is and Ought are simple distinctions, but when it comes to the education
discourse, we find more sophisticated labels being ascribed to
intellectual positions. For example, the distinction between
phenomenology, critical theory and functionalism: where each label is an
aggregation of work by many different thinkers, many of whom didn’t
agree with each other even when they worked in the same field. In the
same way that we might attempt to identify the slippage between is and
ought, when does “phenomenological” refer to Husserl, or to Heidegger
(or even to Hegel)? Equally, when does talk of “critical” refer to Marx,
or to Adorno, or to Horkheimer, or to Fromm?</p>
<p>The issues get thornier. Critical discourse can slip into what is
generally referred to as <em>identity politics</em> where issues of gender,
sexual orientation, race, class and so forth are brought into contact
with ethically and politically-motivated arguments. Whilst critical
theorists and identity theorists point to the deep latent forces in
society which create bias and inequality at various levels, what of the
transductions which apply to a critic’s own self-identification? The
critical attitude is a reaction to a variety of environmental factors,
some of which will be acknowledged, and other which won’t.</p>
<p>The discourse on education and technology derives from social theory as
it has been constituted since Comte. Within that vast domain of concepts
and ideas, there are many grey areas where concepts align, collide and
move apart. In the same way that <em>is</em> and <em>ought</em> might slip from one to
the other, so the distinctions between more fundamental philosophical
approaches might also slip: the 20^th^ century has provided us with
examples of how the aspirations of a Marxist (critical) discourse can
become something deeply functionalist and unpleasant, particularly in
Soviet ideology. Or the complexities of phenomenology cross-over into
functionalist theory, as in the example of Talcott Parsons’s use of the
work on intersubjectivity of Husserl and Schutz. Alternatively, a figure
like Sartre represents the boundary between existentialism and Marxism.</p>
<p>Burrell and Morgan’s text from Management Science, “Sociological
Paradigms and Organisational Analysis” [&#64;burrell_sociological_1982]
identifies four principal ways of thinking about the world (what they
call ‘paradigms,’ drawing on Kuhn’s ideas). Their situating of the
19^th^ and 20^th^ century sociological tradition presents the slippery
concept problem in a way that is used to delineate the discourse and to
counter functionalism’s dominance. Burrell and Morgan’s basic categories
are interpretive approaches, radical Humanism, radical structuralism and
functionalism. This provides a framework within which various approaches
to organisational analysis could be situated. It is in the grey areas of
contact between their paradigms that the same kind of ‘slippage’ between
concepts can occur: the Marxist who displays functionalist tendencies;
the phenomenologist who perceives the principal constraints of
experience in society; or the functionalist who seeks to apply their
equations to consciousness. In the same way that McCulloch’s diagram
could represent the difference between Hume’s ‘is’ and ‘ought,’ so too
it might be used to distinquish the grey boundaries between
functionalism, phenomenology and critical theory in Figure
<a class="reference external" href="#ref:mcculloch2">11.2</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”ref:mcculloch2”}.</p>
<p><img alt="different research paradigms as different levels of interconnectedtransduction" src="_images/mcculloch2.jpg" />{#ref:mcculloch2 width=”\textwidth”}</p>
<p>These grey conceptual areas testify to the contextual reality of
educational research: educational practices are inseparable from the
political context of institutions, the socio-economic context of
societies and the experiential aspects of individuals and their personal
histories. No aspect of education exists independently of any other. Yet
it is not unusual to find researchers creating a separation of
convenience between their work, their professional position and status
and their personal experience. Moreover, the designation of research
approaches as ‘critical,’ ‘phenomenological’ or ‘technical’ are
distinctions which depend on an orientation to alternative ways of
thinking. For example, critical approaches situate themselves against
what they see to be the functionalism of technical or managerial
attitudes, yet this position rarely explores the boundary between the
adopted approach and those approaches which they critique. McCulloch’s
diagram in Figure <a class="reference external" href="#ref:mcculloch2">11.2</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”ref:mcculloch2”} is useful insofar that it suggests that
these boundaries are fluid transductions which are not consistent or
coherent within the discourse, but instead constituted in a dynamic
relation between uninspected assumptions about alternative perspectives.
Unlike Mingers and Bhaskar, these boundaries are not codified but their
categories are the result of emergent transduction processes.</p>

<h2>The Conditions for Social Improvement<a class="headerlink" href="#the-conditions-for-social-improvement" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Why shouldn’t improving education be as possible as improving aircraft
safety or improving dentistry? Smith [&#64;smith_what_2010] argues that
Social change occurs when society’s concepts change and new norms
appear. If conceptual change is accompanied with material evidence -
such as with metal fatigue in an aircraft, or pain in dentistry - then
accompanying conceptual change in society also follows. However, the
process can be slower if society has to challenge its concepts or values
about itself. This transformation of social ‘concepts of self’ lie
behind social changes with regard to racism or equality of opportunity:
through democratic and legal reforms, a society that once thought
nothing of slavery is transformed into one where discrimination with
regard to race, gender or sexuality is punishable by the state.
Educational transformation also requires a shift in society’s concepts
of self: much in educational practice remains unchanged from the 19^th^
century - not least in the idea that schools and universities are
‘factories’ of learning. When evidence supporting change is contestable,
and current practice appears to many to do little damage, then change
remains unlikely. Education remains stuck in a world which is changing
very fast around it.</p>
<p>The challenge is to articulate a meta-level of description which
explains how the many different accounts of learning are produced, and
the many varied educational outcomes - from good to disastrous - are
generated. A meta-level description, must encompass the interactions
between the full gamut of constraints within which teachers, learners,
administrators and parents have to negotiate in their educational
journeys.</p>
<p>In his study “What is a Person?” [&#64;smith_what_2010], Christian Smith
identified a number of conditions for social change where each of his
descriptions can be considered as examples of different adjustments to
constraints. So, for example, Smith argues that:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“Social change occurs when new relationships between different groups
are initiated and when old relationships are weakened or terminated.”
[&#64;smith_what_2010 369]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Relationships between groups and people are dependent on the
intersubjective interactions within which the ways in which different
distinctions about the world - different transductions - are shared. To
change one’s relationships is to change the basic mechanisms whereby
distinctions are drawn. Smith elaborates this change in
distinction-making processes:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“Social change occurs when the categories of understanding of
prevailing social structures change. For example, social structures
change when people no longer think in terms of “lords, peasants and
knights and imagine life instead in terms of burghers, citizens,
traders and entrepreneurs” [&#64;smith_what_2010 370]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>And while distinctions resulting from inter-subjective relations are
transformed, distinctions made about the shared material environment can
also be transformed:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“Social structures change when sustaining material resources are
significantly reduced (and sometimes when then are increased).
Political structures, in particular, become vulnerable with a
reduction in material resources.” [&#64;smith_what_2010 371]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>So a loss of funding, or the loss of a premises for a group meeting can
lead to the dissipation of a social structure: a change in the
constraints of the interface with material reality impacts on the ways
in which the world is conceptualised, and the ways in which new concepts
might be shared between individuals and within groups. But what then of
the changes in communicating differences between different concepts?
Smith argues:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“Social structures change when new or newly mobilized systems of
communication decrease the intractability of coordinated
interactions.” [&#64;smith_what_2010 375]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Partly through improved communications, new concepts, like racism,
sexism, or equality surrounding sexual orientation or personal identity
emerge as new codes replace older ways of making distinctions about
social structure (like class or caste). Smith argues that:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“Social structures change in response to changes in moral and
normative beliefs in the practices, procedures, rules and laws those
belies underwrite.” [&#64;smith_what_2010 372]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Smith’s list of categories of things which change society is a list of
changes to distinctions at different levels. From distinctions created
without words which nevertheless become markers of ‘belonging’ to a
group or not (what he calls “reiterated bodily movement” - like bodily
dispositions such as the ‘swagger’ of a gangster) to the linguistic
creation of new concepts, agreed perceptions about the world, jargon and
so forth, each level of transduction can affect each other level.</p>
<p>Technologies are powerful means of changing society partly because the
constraints produced by technology are so varied and can be changed so
easily. On the one hand, the transduction of the ‘user interface’ is
usually not expressed in language, yet the transductive processes can
work to change the behaviour of an individual using the interface. A
simple example of this is the trialing of new interfaces for popular
tools like Google Mail: users are invited to explore a new interface
while data on their behaviour is then used to refine any improvements
that can improve the experience. Change in technological behaviour may
lead to changes in concepts about the world expressed by an individual
through language. These linguistic transformations may then impact on
changes of social organisation and identification with a social group.
It is precisely this multi-layered transformation of transductions from
interface to language to social group which characterises much of the
social dynamic of social media services like Facebook and Twitter.</p>
<p>The problem is that if there is not a meta-language which describes how
these processes take place, then the continual shifts in transduction
produced by technology can render individuals victims of continual
manipulation of their cognitive processes. For this reason, Beer
referred to the mass media as an ‘entropy pump’: a source of disorder
sowed in the population to disrupt any latent desire to organise itself
to challenge authority.</p>
<p>Education can be made better with conscious awareness and control of
transformations and their effects at all levels of education, and with
careful monitoring of the effects of those changes. In order to follow
through the effects of subtle shifts in emphasis - particularly in
shifts from human conversational processes to technology-driven
processes, effective coordination of a coherent research effort in
education can only occur at the level of synthetic research: it requires
a meta-level systems articulation of how distinctions come to be made
and how they change, and what impact those changes may have. In the
final analysis, all interventions in education will either decrease or
increase the uncertainty and complexity in the environment. This may be
true to the point that asking “does this make the business of
coordinating conversations easier or more complicated?” is the most
effective evaluative question to ask.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="constraint-blindness-and-functionalism">
<h2>Constraint-blindness and Functionalism<a class="headerlink" href="#constraint-blindness-and-functionalism" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Educational problems are human problems to which technological solutions
can seem attractive. Research into technology in education tends towards
functionalism in its advocacy of new technology or pedagogy in
addressing the human problem of education. Whether it’s ‘flipped
classrooms’ or ‘learning analytics,’ the tweaking of transductions in
learning processes often has the aim of ‘solving’ a perceived problem or
difficulty in learning. There are a number of problems with this kind of
research:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>The distinctions about the particular problem to be addressed are
unclear;</p></li>
<li><p>The expected effect of the technological transductions are poorly
analysed or understood;</p></li>
<li><p>The actual effect of the technological transductions are measured by
proxy through the examination of indicators of learning, such as
questionnaires or focus groups, or exam results;</p></li>
<li><p>Any claims for success of the intervention are not evaluated as
themselves being transductions in the discourse;</p></li>
<li><p>Any failures in intervention are not clearly identified as
deviations from expectations by an underlying theory;</p></li>
<li><p>There is rarely any underlying theory.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In order to ‘solve’ educational problems, functionalism has to ignore
many distinctions which are the result of constraints throughout the
education system. Functionalism is principally characterised by this
blindness to uncertainty of an environment of many complex factors which
could render an intervention a success, a failure, or a waste of time.
Because of the nature of its blindness, the label ‘functionalist’ tends
to be an insult hurled by those whose thinking about educational
research is different, and who can see what is ignored.</p>
<p>Among those who can see what is ignored are those individuals who risk
losing out in a world transformed by the functionalist’s intervention.
In institutions today, for example, functionalism tends to get lumped
together with managerialism. It is functionalism which is responsible
for targets, performance metrics, learning analytics, and weaponised
data. Functionalism defends a pragmatic approach which privileges
rational description which is easily codified and communicated, and
which by necessity, tends to wash over rich details of particulars in
favour of broad abstract descriptions of universals. Educational
technology has been framed by the regulative and pragmatic mindset of
the functionalist perspective. In essence, what makes an approach
functionalist is its ascribed <em>purpose</em>.</p>
<p>It is notable that one of the biggest critics of the concept of
‘purpose’ was Stafford Beer, himself often accused of functionalism. In
an acronym, he summarise the illusion of purposes: POSIWID - “the
Purpose Of a System is What It Does”[&#64;beer_heart_1995]. Purpose is
ascribed to a technical system. More interesting then are technical
developments whose purpose is less clear. Complex technological
developments can be seen in the design and production of artefacts like
sculptures or musical instruments or paintings, whose purpose lies
beyond the performance of a ‘function.’ Therefore a technological
approach should not be confused with a functionalist approach.</p>
<p>Functionalism dominates thinking about education as ‘instrumental’ for
economic gain: it can be seen as largely responsible for the current
trend towards the STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics)
agenda which seeks to make the products of education (students) fit for
the technological world. The distinction between functionalism and its
alternatives reproduce themselves across different cultures throughout
history.</p>
<p>Functionalism’s appeal rests in its capacity to coordinate human action
with teleological assertions. The power of scientific advance rests on
the creation of explanations around which society can be ordered.
Functionalism displays a particular relation between logic and reality
whereby individuals with sufficient mastery of analytical skill and
social judgement can coordinate armies, institutions and nations. Human
coordination and goal-directedness may be clearly articulated, and even
when there are differences of opinion as to whether they are good goals
or not, the power of the arguments may still carry along a coalition of
interested parties, not all of whom may agree to the fine detail of what
is the latent rationale. The functionalist ambition to impose categories
on the way that education is coordinated typify many attempts to
intervene with technology in education. Examples in the application of
technology to education have ranged from talk of the e-learning service
frameworks, interoperability, learning analytics to artificial
intelligence and the semantic web: each has adopted a techno-rational
approach. At the same time mantras of openness adopted in the context of
‘open-source’ software development have led to adoption of similar
rhetoric and techno-rational approaches to the development of reusable
resources (e.g. learning objects), and increasingly, the licensing of
‘open content.’</p>
<p>It is clear that certain types of people are attracted to these
initiatives. One of the basic characteristics of functionalism is a lack
of critique of ontological foundations for a proposal: practical and
operational challenges take precedence over the articulation of deeper
rationale for technical interventions. The intellectual endeavour is
targeted toward the production of a ‘functional specification’ within
which processes of functional decomposition amount to processes of
social atomisation which are in turn determinations of particular kinds
of transduction within a system.</p>
<p>Functionalism sits behind methodological approaches too. Research
approaches which characterise themselves as being ‘systemic’ such as
‘Action Research’ often result in technocratic interventions in response
to perceived ‘problems.’ The functionalist rationale seeks to maximise
the organisation of resources, and to fund efforts to design and build
solutions to technical problems, whether they be problems of
interoperability, or problems of resource management at scale. They
deploy methods of investigation and data analysis which themselves have
been designed to solve the ‘problems’ of research. What is lost in all
this the deeper thoughtfulness that humans are capable of when faced
with complexity. Horkheimer accuses this pragmatic technocratic attitude
as contributing</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“a great deal toward the fashionable disrepute of that ‘stationary
contemplation’ which was once the highest aspiration of man. Any idea
of truth, even a dialectical whole of thought, as it occurs in a
living mind, might be called ‘stationary contemplation,’ in so far as
it is pursued for its own sake instead of as a means to ‘consistency,
stability, and flowing intercourse.’’[&#64;horkheimer_eclipse_2013 30]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Having said this, functionalism replaces stationary contemplation with
active collaborative engagement and in this it presents a paradox:
whilst it exhibits a privileging of the ‘active life’ as opposed to the
‘contemplative life’ [&#64;arendt_human_1998], its active engagement with
the apparent problems of society means that it inevitably results in
actual change to transductions, even if those changes are not predicted
in the calculations that led to them. In education, the technocratic
desire to systematise, technologise, automate, to remove redundancies
and inefficiencies and to connect cognate processes are all powerful
interventions in education’s transduction network. But functionalist
approaches have no language to study the effects of their interventions,
no means by which it can detect the difference between the expectations
behind its interventions and the actual consequences of its effects. The
ways of thinking which are tuned-in to detecting these differences
communicate at a different level.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="critique-and-conceptual-transduction">
<h2>Critique and Conceptual Transduction<a class="headerlink" href="#critique-and-conceptual-transduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The functionalist transduction exists as an entity largely because it is
created and identified by the <em>critics</em> of functionalism, such as
Horkheimer, Adorno, Fromm or Marcuse. Each of these in their own way
point to the boundary that separates those who benefit from
functionalism’s approach to technology and those who are subject to
technology and who can find themselves the losers in processes of
technical change, and in each case, where the boundary determines a
power relation with the beneficiaries coordinating a technocratic system
which leaves the individual having no choice but to conform:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“Just as all life today tends increasingly to be subjected to
rationalization and planning, so the life of each individual,
including his most hidden impulses, which formerly constituted his
private domain, must now take the demands of rationalization and
planning into account: the individual’s self-preservation presupposes
his adjustment to the requirements for the preservation of the system.
He no longer has room to evade the system. And just as the process of
rationalization is no longer the result of the anonymous forces of the
market, but is decided in the consciousness of a planning minority, so
the mass of subjects must deliberately adjust themselves: the subject
must, so to speak, devote all his energies to being ‘in and of the
movement of things’ in the terms of the pragmatistic definition”
[&#64;horkheimer_eclipse_2013 67]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The essence of Horkheimer’s critique here is the total domination of
functionalism over both the public and the private domain. However,
education’s functionalism can lead even this kind of critique to acquire
similarities to functionalism: not least among the leaders of their
respective battle-cries: managerialist and technocratic gurus have their
match in the gurus of critical thought (like Horkheimer). That the
leaders of critical approaches to society have found themselves subject
to their own kind of celebrity status as ‘thought leaders’ is largely
due to the structures and processes of the educational institution which
itself has been commandeered by the very functionalist forces which its
critics oppose.</p>
<p>Within the tradition of critical education studies there are many
important insights raised by thinkers such as Paulo Freire
[&#64;freire_pedagogy_1996], Ivan Illich[&#64;illich_deschooling_1995], Augusto
Boal [&#64;boal_theatre_2008], Henry Giroux [&#64;giroux_critical_2011] and Ira
Shor [&#64;shor_critical_1987] who in each case exemplify a carefully
articulated critique about the ‘nature of education’ and an argument
about how education should change. Yet in each case, the critique is
absorbed within the academy, often celebrated, but ultimately rendered
powerless to change anything. Illich, for example, argued that education
is a pathological enterprise whose relation to society as a ‘component’
should be overturned, and yet fascination with Illich’s work remains
strongest within the academy which he sought to overturn. Friere remains
a touchstone of educational theory for aspiring teachers in
institutional schools of education as they wrestle with the the
practical need to fit the system of oppression to which Freire opposed
himself directly. Equally, Bourdieu [&#64;bourdieu_reproduction_1990] or
Basil Bernstein in highlighting the role of social class or language
[&#64;bernstein_pedagogy_2000] in the emergence of educational structures in
society are now taught in the context of cultivating PhD students who
can hold their own in the ‘critical education’ discourse, itself a
manifestation of the bibliometric game that is now played in all
universities. Even those approaches which directly appeal to deeper
ontological inquiry such as Critical Realism [&#64;bhaskar_realist_2008] or
Speculative Realism [&#64;harman_speculative_2018] have emerged as new
streams of discourse within the publishing system, presenting new
opportunities for status acquisition and new ways to feed the pathology
of the academy in its corporatised form.</p>
<p>The ease with which critical theorists have been absorbed within the
corporate structures of the academy reveals something of the deeper
challenges in the relationship between functionalism and critical
theory. Where functionalism is idealist in its blindness to the context
within which it operates, critical discourse can be blind to the
practical steps necessary to transform a system from its current state
into its desired state. In attacking functionalism, or managerialism, or
the marketisation of education, critical theory may serve to reinforce
what it seeks to attack. Like all transductions, the boundary between
functionalism and critique has two sides where the very existence of the
boundary is the result of those two sides pushing against each other. An
awareness of the deeper levels of transduction would be helpful in
coordinating a critical strategy for more fundamental change in
education which disturbs the foundations of the distinctions used to
create boundaries between different value positions.</p>

<p>Communication involves conversation where multiple levels of description
work together to produce what Smith calls ‘normative beliefs in
practices, procedures, rules and laws.’ The world of daily experience,
feelings, reactions, and intentions is subject to multiple descriptions
and simple transformations in an aspect of any single description can
have knock-on effects on the configuration of normative definitions. It
is through this complex mechanism of relations between perceptual
transductions that various forms of social discrimination have been
tackled and eventually new social norms established. Communications
media plays a powerful role in this. Photographs and movies play with
transductions of perception leading to new conversations within society
which in turn lead to the reconfiguring of prevailing attitudes.
Moreover, technology provides the means to democratise the public
expression of experience. For example, the videoing of the high-handed
treatment of survivors of the Grenfell fire disaster by the local
council in London showed the world the reality of an authority which was
out-of-touch with the people who, without the technology, would not have
had the capacity to express their experience so powerfully.</p>
<p>As discussed in chapters 2 and 3, video provides a means of
intersubjective communication. Phenomenology’s boundary with
functionalism, and its boundary with critical theory, is located at the
level at which language is competent to communicate experience.
Phenomenology concerns itself with the relations between perception and
discourse - it is in the relationship between what Luhmann calls the
‘psychic system’ and the ‘social system’ [&#64;luhmann_social_1996] which he
derived from Parsons’s concept of ‘double contingency’ (see chapter 3)
which in turn was influenced by Husserl and Schutz. Transformation of
these intersubjective relations results in transformation of higher
level concepts too, and technology produced new kinds of experience
where this transformation is made possible.</p>
<p>Phenomenology however, like critical theory, also has an awkward
relationship with the academy. Techniques labelled as ‘phenomenological’
have been used to codify ‘experience’ and defend experiential ‘evidence’
for the success or failure of particular interventions. Phenomenology
has been invoked in defending interpretative approaches as being
‘grounded’ because they depend on data from accounts of experience which
feed researcher-defined categories through processes of ‘thematic
analysis.’ Phenomenological approaches such as ‘bracketing-out’ easily
become excuses to ignore fundamental constraints which would render
particular research questions too complex to deal with in the scope of a
PhD or government report. Clearly, the process of identifying questions
to ask in a questionnaire and processes of identifying themes from data
derived from questionnaires are processes of transduction performed by
the researcher, where processes of interpretation and response to
questions in questionnaires are the result of transductions performed by
research subjects. Whilst methodologies like Grounded theory
[&#64;glaser_discovery_1999] have become popular in presenting a way
forwards for social research, it - and approaches like it - really
operates to manage ontological complexity which would otherwise be
overwhelming for students attempting to grapple with intractable
questions within the space of an institutionally-delimited PhD - a
practice which has in turn informed a large percentage of published
papers in the education journals.</p>
<p>Having said this, as discussed in chapters 3 and 5, the essential
question of perception remains fundamental both to education and
science. Bohm, for example, described knowledge as an ‘epiphenomenon of
perception’ and claimed that science is engaged in an ‘essentially
perceptual enterprise’ [&#64;bohm_wholeness_2002], which places perception
at the nexus of the interaction between consciousness, dialogue and the
material world. Meanwhile, Simondon’s connecting of transduction and
individuation similarly places the focus on thought as process in the
context of engagement with a technological world [&#64;simondon_mode_2017].
Inspiring Simondon, the ideas behind McCulloch’s model of perception
contains not only a model of an alternative logic, but also provides a
guide for situating the dynamics between alternative values and
positions adopted by researchers whether functionalist, critical or
phenomenological. This is not to say that phenomenology is a superior
perspective, but it is to acknowledge that phenomenology - in
conjunction with cybernetics - may provide the necessary meta-language
for situating different research positions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-uncertainty-opportunity">
<h2>The Uncertainty Opportunity<a class="headerlink" href="#the-uncertainty-opportunity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The published discourse reveals incommensurability between
functionalist, critical and phenomenological positions: not only are
philosophical positions incompatible, but the language of the different
journals looking at education varies enormously, and educational
researchers often remain estranged from one another. Yet, behind it all,
nobody is sure about the knowledge claims they make. If anyone has made
the advances in research that are occasionally claimed, then the human
problem of education would have been solved!</p>
<p>Uncertainty and technology provides an opportunity. While researchers in
education maintain their positions in journals, in conversation - should
such an opportunity arise for conversation between researchers from
different perspectives - produces different results. Such conversations
occur within institutions when they set about upgrading their technology
provision, or refreshing their curriculum, or engaging in collaborative
projects. While the shared practical tasks of institutional life can
provide a platform for some to state their positions in a strident way,
others can be encouraged to express their uncertainty about education,
and to challenge the professed certainty of others.</p>
<p>These processes can be valuable, although published research in
educational journals can get in the way: the surest way to close down a
conversation is to claim that ‘research shows that…’ and cite some
journal article. Ironically, educational research can attenuate
conversation. Yet at the same time, those who either take a strong stand
about education being about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y\)</span>, or those who seek to close
debate by citing research, reveal more about themselves that potentially
exposes them to deeper questioning, and a more honest sharing of
uncertainty. As discussed in chapter 3, the intersubjective revealing of
uncertainty can take many forms.</p>
<p>What is revealed in conversation are the different ‘tribes’ of
education. A meta-level understanding of how different tribes relate to
one another, for example, through the relation between functionalist
approaches (which often typify the educational manager who argues “all
you’ve got to do is…”) and the critical theorist, can be an aid to
conversational interventions with powerful questions that destabilise
entrenched positions sufficiently that a deeper collective understanding
may be gained.</p>
<p>However, this doesn’t address the problem of a broader public discourse
about education. If the education journals risk getting in the way of an
open expression of uncertainty, what should we do instead? In the next
chapter, I discuss the work of Marion Milner whose psychoanalytical
approach to educational organisations and to learning formed the basis
of a meta-description. Milner’s work is little-known in educational
research: it ill-fits the expectations of research journals that seek
conventional social science methods. While some of her language feels
dated today, the overall approach exemplifies the construction of a
meta-language which can be useful in coordinating research efforts to
address the human problems of education.</p>

<div class="section" id="dialogue-on-human-problems">
<h2>Dialogue on Human Problems<a class="headerlink" href="#dialogue-on-human-problems" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the late 1970s and early 1980s, spiritual leader Jiddhu Krishnamurti
and physicist David Bohm participated in a lengthy series of dialogues
about the philosophy, the nature of reality and world’s problems
[&#64;bohm_ending_1997]. In the final dialogue, Krishnamurti begins by
asking whether human problems are soluble:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“I am asking in this dialogue whether it is possible to have no human
problems at all - only technological problems, which can be solved.
But human problems seem insoluble. Is it because of our education, our
deep-rooted traditions, that we accept things as they are?”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>After some considerable soul-searching Bohm responds</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“I wonder if we should even call these things problems, you see. A
problem would be something that is reasonably solvable. If you put the
problem of how to achieve a certain result, then that presupposes that
you can reasonably find a way to do it technologically. But
psychologically, the problem cannot be looked at in that way; to
propose a result you have to achieve, and then find a way to do it.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Bohm’s insight highlights the fundamental dichotomy of educational
technology. Technology in education is approached - by institutions,
teachers, and sometimes learners - as a solution to a human problem. Yet
the human problem of education is not one for which the result one wants
to achieve can be specified in a simple way such that technology can be
proposed as a solution. Most commonly, attempts to solve human problems
in this way simply creates a deeper problem, and it is this to which
Krishnamurti is drawing attention. Krishnamurti’s suspicion that
education might be a cause of human problems: that education attempts to
solve human problems through technological intervention would suggest
that some blame for the state of the world must sit at education’s feet.</p>
<p>Education is a human problem to which institutions attempt to find
solutions. In this book, I have outlined the multiple dimensions in
which that problem manifests itself: the problem of making distinctions,
the problem of conversation, the problem of institutional organisation,
the problem of science and knowledge, the problem of openness, the
problem of collective decision and judgement, the problem of economics,
and so on. The human problem of education is part of all these problems.
The extent to which education seems to be an exacerbating factor in the
production of these problems may partly be due to the fact that we do
not possess a meta-language for human problems: a way of talking about
the connectedness of human problems. Drawing-out the interconnectedness
of human problems has been an underlying aim throughout this book.</p>
<p>Human problems arise at the interfaces between distinction-making
processes. They are the result of transductions in the same way that
there are transductions between the different ‘tribes’ that think about
education (functionalists, critical theorists, and phenomenologists)
detailed in chapter 11. Small changes to transduction processes between
individuals can have large-scale effects at all levels of the system,
especially if the dynamics of small-scale interventions are understood.
It is the difference between the positioning between a learner and a
teacher being such that the learner feels subjugated or belittled, and
where the learner feels listened to. These most fundamental aspects of
human relations sit on what manifests as the tiniest nuances of
expression: it can be so much as a glint in the eye, or a stiffened body
posture. Yet these are distinctions, and they can change everything.</p>
<p>This chapter concerns a psychotherapeutic approach to the human problem
of the university. In introducing this, it is first important to make
the connection between the <em>technical</em> problems of the university and
the human problem and how the idea of transduction holds the key to
connect the two. Human problems result from conflicts in human
distinction-making, but these distinction-making processes are not
separable from our technological and institutional contexts. Simondon
has articulated a powerful argument for the connection between
human-technical relations and the deepest processes of human
individuation. He accuses those who would draw a distinction between
‘culture and technics’ of a ‘facile humanism’ which:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“masks a reality rich in human efforts and natural forces, and which
constitutes a world of technical objects as mediators between man and
nature.” [&#64;simondon_mode_2017]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Jungian psychotherapy sees individuation as a goal whereby humans become
whole, uniting the psyche and lived experience. Simondon’s individuation
is similar, but points to the distinction-making processes made by the
individual in a world of technical objects. Many of these
distinction-making processes lie at the interfaces between humans,
machines and institutions. In considering psychotherapeutic approach to
the human problem of university, we draw on the example of a Jungian
analysis of the “Human Problem in Schools” [&#64;milner_human_2018].</p>
<p>Marion Milner was a Jungian analyst who in the 1930s studied a number of
schools in England. She attempted to identify the constraints
determining the behaviour, motivation and feelings of students,
teachers, parents and managers. Milner is interested in the distinctions
that her research participants make; she is interested in ways in which
those distinctions might be changed, and in the ways that a change at
one level leads to a change at other levels. Through a methodical
process of interviews and playing games (including an innovative
‘postcard sorting’ game she devised to identify the interests of the
children) Milner attempts to identify the dimensions of uncertainty with
which each of her participants is trying to negotiate.</p>
<p>Whilst this research is about schools and not universities, the method
is applicable at all levels of the education system. Moreover, Milner’s
prescription for addressing some of the underlying problems -
particularly that of ‘anxiety’ - have technological and social
counterparts in today’s society, and in drawing comparisons between her
methods and insights and today’s universities, ways of thinking about
technology and human problems in universities can be brought more
clearly into focus. Milner regards tools and techniques of research as
instruments of perception, which both focus the perceptions of those
using them, and reveal perceptual processes to others. It is this focus
on the relationship between technology and perception which I draw
attention to in the latter part of the chapter.</p>

<div class="section" id="transductions-in-milner-s-the-human-problem-in-schools">
<h2>Transductions in Milner’s ‘The Human Problem in Schools’<a class="headerlink" href="#transductions-in-milner-s-the-human-problem-in-schools" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Like many psychoanalysts, Milner is first and foremost interested in
accounts of experience. She applied many of the techniques she used in
her school studies to her own self-analysis, both from diaries she kept
[&#64;milner_life_2011] and in documenting her practice of art
[&#64;milner_not_2010]. The common feature that unites her self-analytical
studies and her work on schools is that she uses psychoanalytic
vocabulary (mostly drawn from Jung) which identify broader psychodynamic
processes which are used to explain the phenomena she observes.</p>
<p>Using simple techniques to stimulate reflection among the children and
adults in the schools, Milner draws out accounts of perception as
indications of the processes by which children make distinctions about
their feelings about school, subjects, their future and the world.
Essentially, she is trying to identify where and how the transduction
processes are working in whole system, and where and how they might
conflict. Since these accounts of perception are epiphenomena of a
deeper psychodynamic process, her work seeks to speculate and codify the
generative mechanism responsible for them, and to identify their
connection to the structural relations and constraints in the school.
‘The Human Problem in Schools’ maps accounts of perceptions against a
variety of general categories including:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The physical conditions</p></li>
<li><p>Arrangement of the Timetable</p></li>
<li><p>Teaching Methods</p></li>
<li><p>Mental Health of Teachers</p></li>
<li><p>Intelligence of students and Vocational training</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Milner captured in note-form the perception of the difficulties faced by
various members of staff and by the children. Her notes indicate the
ways that each individual in the school perceived and managed
uncertainty and anxiety. It is striking how much of her account would
ring true to teachers both in school and university today including
things like the “difficulty of the form mistress in getting to know her
form when very often she does not teach them all,” to concerns that “the
children are not putting in their share of work [and] they don’t
really work in class” or a belief that the children are ‘spoonfed.’</p>
<p>Milner’s principal objective in doing this work was, as she put it, to</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“find out what kind of contribution the psychologist could make to
educational problems, and in order to do so it was necessary first to
concentrate upon trying to obtain a clear idea of what kinds of
problems existed, rather than to attempt any exact statement of the
number of times each problem occurred.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>It is this attempt to identify existent problems which leads to an
analytical process that draws out the manifest transductions. These
transductions, if identified accurately, can then be manipulated with
various kinds of educational intervention which might aleviate some of
the problems of the children or the staff.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="milner-s-categorisation-of-perception-and-beer-s-uncertainty-diagram">
<h2>Milner’s Categorisation of Perception and Beer’s Uncertainty Diagram<a class="headerlink" href="#milner-s-categorisation-of-perception-and-beer-s-uncertainty-diagram" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There is a similarity between Milner noting the perceptions and
anxieties of the children and the teachers and the kind of uncertainty
management processes which have been discussed throughout this book.
Given the categories of experience which Milner identifies, it is
possible to map some of her findings onto the cybernetic diagrams which
illustrate the transductions of uncertainty management introduced in
earlier chapters. The value of drawing uncertainty and transduction in
this way is to identify the balances that are struck between inner
(psychodynamic) uncertainty management and outer (environmental)
uncertainty management. This is instructive since Milner’s prescription
for addressing some of the human problems of school are environmental
interventions which she considers to have an effect on the inner
psychodynamic balance: she seeks inner transformation through making
changes to the lifeworld of the students.</p>
<p>At the simplest level, Milner’s identification of some the difficulties
of the staff and the principles by which those staff seek to manage
these difficulties map onto a basic template comprising a) an area of
difficulty which produces uncertainty; b) a higher level principle which
is used to operate on the problem domain; c) a set of inter-relations
between different problem domains where the approaches to dealing with
one problem domain affect approaches to dealing with the others.</p>
<p>These categories can be seen as representing a ‘system to be managed’
(a), a metasystem which seeks to mop-up uncertainties produced by the
system to be managed (b), and a set of interconnections between the
different metasystems (c). The metasystem communications might be
thought of as conversations which occur within the institution, and
these communications cross boundaries of experience (for example, the
affect on behaviour of home issues, or the disruption caused by a change
of teacher) involve their own transduction processes. At the simplest
level, the point is to draw out the interconnectedness of processes
which are attempting to manage different areas of operations and
uncertainty.</p>
<p>Drawing attention to three of the issues which Milner identifies from
interviewing staff, this approach is illustrated in Figure
<a class="reference external" href="#ref:milner1">[ref:milner1]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”ref:milner1”}. Her teachers identify three principal domains
of uncertainty concerning the their environment and the maintenance of
professional identity.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The practical problem of classroom management and the relationship
with the children;</p></li>
<li><p>The problem of the perceived function of teaching and the
professional identity of the teacher;</p></li>
<li><p>The organisational problem of coordinating progression of the
children through the school.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these school-based concerns have a counterpart in education at
all levels, including university. Milner’s teachers reveal their (often
simple) techniques and mantras for managing each uncertainty. Each of
these techniques reference in some way a metasystem relating to either
the professional purpose and function of teaching, the operational
environment of the school to support progression of students, or the
basic operation and management of the classroom. In Figure
<a class="reference external" href="#ref:milner1">[ref:milner1]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”ref:milner1”} these are the three areas which are indicated,
each of which produces uncertainty in its operations, and each of which
has a metasystem to mop-up this uncertainty.</p>
<p>For each function, the metasystem has to maintain some coherent model of
what the system it is responsible for is meant to do. The coherent
picture of the metasystem however, is never fully presented, but exists
in relation to the different techniques that the teachers articulate.
For example, the basic technique of ensuring that teachers ‘know the
names’ of their students is a category which references a broader model
of what it is to manage the class (the bottom element in Figure
<a class="reference external" href="#ref:milner1">[ref:milner1]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”ref:milner1”}). The metasystem model also contains a model of
the system itself, so when Milner’s teachers talk about the importance
of ‘not being tired,’ there is obviously awareness of the conditions
within which things might fall apart.</p>
<p>When considering the system of expectations about the overall purpose
and function of teaching (Figure
<a class="reference external" href="#ref:milner1">[ref:milner1]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”ref:milner1”}, top), the priority for teachers in ‘instilling
a desire to learn’ or ‘not spoon-feeding’ references a metasystemic
model that sees teaching as a function to facilitate some degree of
self-organisation, although from Milner’s account, the loftier goals
articulated here did not sit easily with the practical realities of the
classroom.</p>
<p>A similar theme comes out of the metasystem concerning the ‘operations
to coordinate student progression.’ In terms of managing the progression
of learners, teachers’ insistence on ‘consistency’ and ‘clear
expectations’ is used to uphold a principle of keeping order in the
school (what is indicated in the diagram as ‘behaviour conditioning
models’).</p>
<p>The approach to drawing some of Milner’s results like this results in
the identification of three metasystemic functions. The approach could
be extended to included her studies of the children or parents. But as
it is extended, we have to ask about how the communications from one
metasystem might affect the others. For example, might the desire for
clear and consistent expectations to facilitate smooth coordination
through school interfere with broader goals of ‘instilling the desire to
learn,’ or will the stress of trying to keep it all together simply
result in exhausted teachers, and the ensuing problems of classroom
management? It is this where Milner identifies her ‘human problem.’</p>
<p>In analysing the problems of the children, Milner focuses particularly
on anxiety, using a questionnaire which asked what might be improved in
the childrens’ experience. She captured a list of ‘miscellaneous
worries’: the children worried about ‘people being cross,’ ‘not being
clever,’ ‘telling lies,’ ‘quarrels,’ ‘losing things,’ ‘being late,’
‘forgetting to do something they had promised to do,’ and ‘being
depressed.’ In codifying the miscellaneous anxieties and preferences of
the children, Milner used a grid derived from Jung’s basic distinction
between extroversion and introversion. By asking children about their
preferences, wishes and daydreams, she speculated on the different kinds
of psychodynamic forces at work in each case.</p>
<p>Whatever experiences the children articulated, Milner argued that these
were necessarily related to various dimensions of the context they were
in. These included:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The nature of the parents’ interests</p></li>
<li><p>Amount of change in the environment</p></li>
<li><p>Opportunities available for the multi-level solution of conflict</p></li>
<li><p>Companionship of equals</p></li>
<li><p>Amount of emotional stress in relationship with adults</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these factors indicate some aspect of environmental uncertainty
with which whatever internal uncertainties the child was managing had to
be balanced. With regard to the relationship with parents’ interests,
what would be later seen by Bowlby as issues of attachment (see chapter
10) is particularly interesting as Milner comments on the “emotional
stress that determines the identification with or repudiation of the
parent’s interests.” Related to this, the amount of “change in the
environment” reflects more general changes to the lifeworld of the child
within which appropriate “habits of response” might develop (Milner
highlights the case of a child whose father’s change of work meant that
she changed school every year, and consequently despite being highly
capable, often “displayed problems in concentration and coordination”)
Milner also highlights the importance of conversation, citing Piaget’s
experiments as evidence for this influence on ‘psychic growth’ - a
concept which she would have also associated with Freud and Jung.</p>
<p>Throughout her analysis, her focus remains practical: she is interested
in ‘dispersing anxiety,’ using Jungian concepts of sensation, intellect,
intuition and emotion to situate different kinds of environmental
intervention which might rebalance the relationship between internal and
external uncertainties.</p>
<p>Given these complexities, the particular needs of the children, and the
constraints in the organisation of school, its activities and its
problems, she noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“much of the time now spent in exhortation is fruitless; […] very
often it is not necessary to do anything; the implicit change in
relationship that results when the adult is sympathetically aware of
the child’s difficulties is in itself sufficient.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In other words, what mattered was the intersubjective engagement of a
‘sympathetic person’ who was able to tune-in to the world of the child
and allow them to express some of their inner uncertainties as they
dealt with the particular environment (home and school) that they found
themselves in.</p>
<p>Part of Milner’s work focuses on the use of art and creativity, and her
approach to addressing some of the issues raised by the children place
particular emphasis on personal expression. Here she was influential on
art education in both schools and universities. Her work shares with
other psychotherapeutic approaches to art education (notably those of
Herbert Read [&#64;read_education_1958] and later Anton Ehrenzweig
[&#64;ehrenzweig_hidden_1968]) an emphasis on the role of making as an
expressive engagement with the environment which assists in the
rebalancing of inner psychic forces. Ehrenzweig developed her insights
further in his contribution to higher educational thinking in art, as
well as making deeper connections to gestalt psychology and mental
health, leading Ehrenzweig to argue that “mental illness is creativity
gone wrong” [&#64;ehrenzweig_hidden_1968].</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="technological-manipulation-as-research-into-human-problems">
<h2>Technological Manipulation as Research into Human Problems<a class="headerlink" href="#technological-manipulation-as-research-into-human-problems" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The world of Milner’s schools, whilst being bureaucratic and formal, was
free of the kind of technological constraints which now form part of
today’s human problem of education. Nobody implements new educational
technologies with a view to making the human problem more complicated,
and yet, when faced with the complexities of unfamiliar interfaces,
passwords and problems of connectivity, often technologies do become
part of the problem. Technological interventions in education rarely
work as they are intended, and if they are seen to be of benefit, new
risks arise in technical ‘solutions’ becoming codified and even mandated
by management, constraining alternative non-technological approaches.</p>
<p>Milner’s approach to education takes a different stance to the manifest
phenomena which result from technological interventions: rather than ask
ourselves what worked or went wrong, or why it is that education did or
didn’t improve, she would argue that the added constraints of the
technology reveal new insights into the psychodynamic processes which
were always in operation within human learning. In other words,
technology is a torch for illuminating deeper truths about human
relations and human problems. In this sense, the implementation of
technology is itself a bit like introducing a simple game into a
learning conversation: through the constraints of the game, one learns
something about the constraints of each other.</p>
<p>In the sense of placing a new constraint in the environment through
which one learns something new about those interacting with it,
technological interventions can have a similar effect to artistic and
creative interventions. Technology interferes with accepted ways of
perceiving the world. A more technical way of describing this is to say
that the “accepted ways of perceiving the world” arise as the results of
the kinds of transduction processes that Warren McCulloch described (see
chapter 11), and that technologies are an interference to these
transduction processes. Since any category is a transduction involving
other categories, and each categorisation process is part of a response
to survival in an environment, what is learnt through technical
intervention is how different individuals construct their categories.
Technologies illuminate the processes by which categories come into
being in relation to other categories, the environment, objects and
other people.</p>
<p>How might knowledge of the ways in which categories are made shed light
on the human problem of university? The deeper psychodynamic knowledge
allows for more penetrating communications and transformative
conversations. It is those conversations which, ultimately, can result
in the transformation of the institution of education. Revisiting
Christian Smith’s work from chapter 11, interventions can be seen as
meta-processes of transduction realignment which bring to consciousness
inner dynamics whereby incremental advances might be made. From the
transductions of the individual from where their enthusiasms, passions,
identity and fears emerge, to the transductions in the relations between
people and their obligations, commitments and rights, through to the
communication of uncertainty and understanding in different media, and
the transductions of academic discourse, and barriers of entry into the
academy, a meta-conversation remains a possibility whereby a deeper
connection between society, individuals and institutions can be
coordinated.</p>
<p>Technological intervention is rather like changing some fundamental
aspect of the background of familiar practice, in the way that an artist
might change the background of a picture, or a composer might present a
familiar tune with a different harmony: things appear in a ‘new light.’
It invites the question, what is the difference between doing things
with this technology as opposed to doing things as they were done
before? How can we be more specific about the differences between what
might initially appear to be ‘functionally-equivalent’ solutions to
problems?</p>
<p>Reflection on what technology reveals about practice is different from
the functionalist approach that sees technology as an alternative way of
performing an already-established task. To the functionalist,
technologies are seen as ‘improvements’ to practice, and indeed,
improvements to institutional organisation, efficiency, and so on. But
instead, we can see technology as a light on current practice whereby
the human problem of existing practice, existing organisation and
existing mindsets might be explored and discussed. This is not to
discard the functionalist motivation for making an improvement, but by
putting the focus on human problems, it avoids the pitfall that
technical interventions end up solving technical, and not human,
problems.</p>

<h2>Technology and the Human problems of Science and Learning<a class="headerlink" href="#technology-and-the-human-problems-of-science-and-learning" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It has been one of the core arguments of this book that transduction
realignment is what happens in teaching and learning, and that
conversation is the principal transduction process whereby categories
are formed, maintained and changed. This is perhaps to restate what
Simondon articulated about transduction, and to highlight the connection
which he too made between individuation processes and technology:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“By transduction we mean an operation - physical, biological, mental,
social - by which an activity propagates itself from one element to
the next, within a given domain, and founds this propagation on a
structuration of the domain that is realized from place to place: each
area of the constituted structure serves as the principle and the

extent that the modification expands progressively at the same time as
the structuring operation” [&#64;simondon_position_2009]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>However if this philosophical definition of transduction is to have
practical value then the implications of understanding transduction have
to be carried forwards in our institutional structures, our scientific
research practices, and the processes of human decision. Shifts in
transductions are learning processes, and therefore the role of
technology in these transduction manipulation processes is not only
relevant to the human problem of institutional organisation, but also to
the human problems of science and education.</p>
<p>But there is a more subtle point that is made by Milner’s work. The
psychotherapeutic approach details the fine-tuning in the relations
between teachers and learners within the school. It is these fine
details of behaviour and attitude which can make the difference between
a relationship that works and one that doesn’t. What does the teacher do
to shift understanding from one category to another, or even to raise
awareness about the mechanisms that bring categories into being in the
first place? What does the researcher do to change the way that
categories are thought about? We have said that teaching involves the
making of multiple descriptions of the same thing, or that no concept or
idea is a ‘single’ thing - every concept brings multiplicity and
uncertainty which necessitates conversation between people. This
uncertainty necessitates transduction. But in the same way that a
musician learning to play a piece of Bach will understand that the
finest points of articulation in the music have a fundamental bearing on
the coherence of the piece, so teachers understand that the deepest
control of the transductions of the relationship are the things that
really make things work or not. The key is always in the listening.</p>
<p>This also means that knowledge itself only exists so long as people
actively and artfully listen to one another and negotiate their
different descriptions of things. David Bohm explains it by arguing
that:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“the purpose of science isn’t knowledge. Knowledge is an epiphenomenon
of perception. Science is primarily engaged in a perceptual
enterprise” [&#64;bohm_david_2007]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Teachers articulate multiple descriptions in many ways, including the
innovative use of technology. Researchers who think deeply about their
research domain will change their own personal constructs, and these in
turn will affect the conversations they have. The efficacy of research
in transforming education is the same as the efficacy of great teaching.
It requires the generation of multiple descriptions and the facilitation
of conversation. The resulting conversation creates new intersubjective
transductions which gradually shift pre-existing transductions. In the
end, it is always the conversation which does the work.</p>
<p>Having said this, the critics of educational research will argue that it
remains pointless and ineffective in delivering better education. Both
the managerialist’s confidence in engineering solutions to the ‘wicked’
human problems of education, and the functionalist’s euphoria over the
functionally equivalent affordances of new technologies will prevail in
creating an education system which becomes more technocratic rather than
more thoughtful and conversational. The reasons why this has happened,
and may for the time being continue to happen, are rooted in a systems
dynamic between the hierarchical organisation of institutions and an
environment of increasing uncertainty. This book has articulated the
reasons why this dynamic is unsustainable and will eventually become
unviable. The ‘lack of effectiveness’ problem in educational research
lies in not being conscious of the relation between research activities
and the environment within which those activities take place.</p>

<h2>Milner’s Prescription<a class="headerlink" href="#milner-s-prescription" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The human problem of school as Milner sees it is a self-reinforcing
network of conflicting distinctions. Cybernetically, this results from
transduction processes at different levels, from the individual psyches
of teachers, learners and managers to distinctions about expectations of
the management and organisation of the school. She sees this network as
the cause of anxiety in the children, and seeks to recommend
interventions to alleviate anxiety by rebalancing the psychodynamic
processes.</p>
<p>Milner focuses on what she sees as the particular educational needs of
the children, and recommends five different kinds of intervention, each
of which involve some kind of change to the environment of the child.
These environmental changes are connected to the inner psychic processes
of the child, and Milner argues that such interventions can provide a
corrective to psychodynamic imbalances, changing perception of
themselves and others. Her six areas of intervention are:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Physical experience</p></li>
<li><p>Emotional experience</p></li>
<li><p>Intuitive experience</p></li>
<li><p>Intellectual experience</p></li>
<li><p>Finding a social function</p></li>
<li><p>Creative work</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Within ‘physical experience’ Milner considers physiological
interventions such as games, a ‘brisk walk’ or a ‘good meal.’ In other
words, a temporary transformation of the physiological environment which
may lead to some release of inner tension. A different kind of
environmental distraction is suggested in what Milner calls ‘emotional
experience,’ which can mean anything from musical expression to
emotional relationships. Within ‘intuitive experience’ she considers
that travel or involvement in social entertainment may be sufficiently
disruptive to rebalance psychic forces. She speculates (no doubt guided
by Jung’s categories) that another kind of escape may be found through
intellectual pursuits, although she notes that this depends on
capability and inclination of the individual. At a broader level, she
argues that realising a particular social function and identifying with
a group is often effective, although she notes that with those children
who are ‘over-anxious’ can find group contexts intimidating. With regard
to creative work, Milner considers that “there is no doubt about the
existence of the impulse to make something, or about the stabilising
effect of having given it expression.”</p>
<p>What would Milner’s list of interventions look like today? Perhaps for
example, an ‘intuitive’ intervention might now include a virtual reality
tour of space or deep sea diving, or an intellectual intervention might
be pausing to watch videos on Khan Academy, or an emotional experience
might be watching episodes of a favourite TV show, or a physical
experience may be playing ‘Pokemon Go,’ while a creative experience may
be writing a blog post or sending an update to social media. Milner’s
interventions amount to transformations of perception; today’s
technology appears to do the same.</p>
<p>In considering these modern versions of Milner’s prescriptions, however,
there is an important difference between school in the 1930s and the
life of students today: technology has increased the possibilities for
action to such an extent that all possibilities, from virtual reality to
watching the favourite TV show, are available most of the time. The only
thing that stops them being available are the restrictions of the
institutional context that students find themselves in. Milner
prescribes changes to the environment as a corrective to the anxieties
arising from the human problem of education. Today, it is much more
difficult to make distinctions between the problems of education and the
problems relating to everyday life, when the deep problem of choice of
activity and its ensuing uncertainty suffuses everything.</p>
<p>Milner doesn’t discuss the conversations which occur when a ‘physical’
or ‘emotional’ intervention is made, but implicit in her description is
the fact that there are new things to talk about, potentially with new
people. The same is true today. Technology provides objects which can be
a focus for discussion in ways which are more flexible and dynamic than
the foci of discussion that were provided in in the 1930’s schoolroom,
or indeed through today’s curricula. Computer games, websites, music and
film all provide objects around which conversations are coordinated
among peers. While the uncertainties and complexities of life today may
be greater than they were in the 1930s, the capacity to coordinate rich
conversations in dynamic and flexible ways is vastly increased.</p>

<h2>Philosophical Reflection: Technology as a Tool of Perception<a class="headerlink" href="#philosophical-reflection-technology-as-a-tool-of-perception" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The capabilities of modern technology to create transformations in the
human environment of education, which is itself the result of
technology’s capacity to ‘amplify’ descriptions of the world, raises a
deeper question about the nature of technology in the context of human
relations. We tend to think of tools as providing a facility to perform
a particular action: psychologists talk of ‘affordances,’ philosophers
(notably Heidegger), speak of the ‘to-handedness’ of tools and
artefacts; others, including Merleau-Ponty and Marhsall McLuhan point
towards the way that the material world and its artefacts appear to be
extensions of the flesh: “the flesh of the world,” as Merleau-Ponty
calls it.</p>
<p>Within this book, I have been painting a picture of technology which
puts human intersubjective relations at the centre, not the individual
human relationship with tools in the world. What matters is not the
performance of a particular task, or the reaching of a particular
objective, but instead the intersubjective coordination of
understanding. This seems counter-intuitive to a practical mindset that
would see practical problems that need to be solved with technology.
Yet, the very identification of a ‘problem’ is an aspect of
intersubjective engagement in the first place.</p>
<p>A ‘practical problem’ is an aspect of the lifeworld which frames the
intersubjective engagement of many people. That it can be said “we have
a problem - we need a solution” is the first step in this: what Bohm
calls a ‘technological problem.’ Clever people, each of whom will have
their own complex motivation, will seek solutions - probably involving
technologies of some sort. That each tool or solution is ‘evaluated’ is
an intersubjective process of revealing some of the underlying
perceptions of the people proposing any solution. All technologies
reveal perception, and through the process of revealing perception,
conversational coordination is changed as the transductions within each
person embrace new categories or discards old ones.</p>
<p>We may think that a shovel ‘affords’ digging, but in thinking this we
imagine ourselves as observers of a person digging, understanding what
the digging means. If however, we are observers of another person
behaving in a ‘digging manner’ with a shovel, our inquiry is not about
the shovel itself but about the behaviour (why are they digging? What is
going on with them? How can I communicate with them?). The shovel is
merely some aspect of the lifeworld which reveals these questions. It is
in appreciating this that the fundamental split between what is called
‘transcendental’ and ‘existential’ phenomenology (i.e. between Husserl
and Heidegger) is brought into focus: Heidegger, I suggest, was wrong in
imagining ‘being-in-the-world’ (<em>dasein</em> as he called it) as the
principal characteristic of being human; Husserl’s intersubjective
position, that we exist and tune-in to others, is not only powerful in
accounting for conversation and learning, but also accounts for the
material aspects of being, including technologies as ‘revealers of
understanding.’</p>
<p>Technology, then, is not (and cannot be) in itself a solution to human
problems. Human problems exist between human beings whose
intersubjective processes grapple with uncertainties of distinctions
which can only be resolved through conversation. Tools and artefacts
serve to illumninate perceptual processes which may help transform the
intersubjective engagement, but equally they may be used to suppress the
conversation about the uncertainties which they themselves reveal.</p>
<p>This insight puts education and the conversations, whose job it is for
education to facilitate, at the heart of being human, and at the root of
the processes which can address human problems. At the heart of this is
that all distinction-making involves transduction. This process is
central to understanding the way each of us perceives the world and
arrives at categories to describe and discuss our experiences. The way
to make education and society better is to manipulate transduction
processes and interpret the effects they have. These exist at multiple
levels: they concern the concepts used to describe theories, practices,
types of organisation, and methods of teaching. They also concern
experiences of learning, social structures around family life, the
progress from early childhood to adulthood and attachments. They concern
transductions around subject disciplines and the artificial boundaries
placed between disciplinary areas. The future of a society and education
is entirely tied up with the future of technology.</p>

<div class="section" id="our-childrens-children-and-the-university-s-problem">
<h2>Our Childrens’ Children and the University’s Problem<a class="headerlink" href="#our-childrens-children-and-the-university-s-problem" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In a society that mandates that children should go to school, the human
problem of school remains a problem for the whole of society: for
parents, children, teachers, school leaders, professors of education and
government ministers. The human problem of school co-exists with the
other human problems of life.</p>
<p>Nobody is forced to go to university. The human problem of university is
one that learners inflict upon themselves - partly in response to the
human problems of life, the need for certificates, uncertainty as to
what to do with one’s life, the need for friendship and community or the
burning desire to pursue truth and knowledge.</p>
<p>Will we reach a point where young people understand the human problems
of life to such an extent that they regard university as an unnecessary
or even a deleterious burden? There are (as yet) no signs that this will
happen: university remains popular, with admissions having experienced a
dramatic rise in the last two decades. However, today’s students are
tomorrow’s parents, and tomorrow’s parents face a world of ever
increasing complexity and uncertainty on the one hand, and technological
possibility on the other. They face a world of economic inequality in an
increasingly chaotic and threatening natural environment which will
produce mass migration and social instability. Their standard of living
(in most developed countries) is unlikely to exceed that of their
parents, and in many cases, they will not be able to afford to own their
own houses, will face increasing taxation to deal with the burden of
social care, and may well be continuing to repay their student loans
when their own children reach the age of going to university. What
narrative will pass between the generations about the human problem of
university? Will the world outside the university, together with
whatever technological advances occur in the dissemination of knowledge,
be seen to be a better teacher than the world of the academy?</p>
<p>This may be the future in about 30 years’ time. Will today’s
universities understand their own human problems in a way where they
might act to off-set a narrative that steers tomorrow’s generation away
from the academy? The answer to this depends on how the university sees
its current problems, and how it perceives its environment. Most
universities today consider themselves to have ‘operational’ problems
which relate to various measures, many of them instigated by government,
to compete in an educational marketplace. Most universities today see
their job as ‘selling’ education, or at least attempting to
differentiate their own particular brand of education from offerings
made by other institutions. Differentiation between competing
institutions in an artificial market inevitably means that there is very
little difference between different institutions beyond the mere fact of
the declared scarcity of their offerings: Oxford and Cambridge are
unlikely to offer apprenticeships or open the doors of their most
illustrious colleges to all-comers.</p>
<p>Competition within an artificial market also means that promises are
made to future ‘customers’ about the benefits of study and
qualification. Universities are in a poor position to defend promises
about salary expectations in a world that becomes more uncertain, where
employment becomes more precarious, housing is increasingly out-of-reach
of the young, and the world moves at a faster pace than any university
curriculum can keep pace with. The parents of tomorrow not only shoulder
the burdens of an uncertain world, but may well carry the injury of
broken promises by their own universities.</p>
<p>But if our childrens’ children shun the academy, what happens to
science? What happens to the centuries of accumulated knowledge stored
in the honeycombs of university libraries? Does it all go online behind
paywalls? What happens to civilisation? Do we all become slaves to some
AI-empowered regime or corporation?</p>
<p>I do not believe this is our future, but I do believe that the hierarchy
of the ancient academy is unviable in the long term. It will be replaced
with new ways of coordinating intellectual inquiry, and the recognition
and codification of individual ability and status. Reductionist
divisions between subjects will give way to new developments in science
where quantum mechanics, biology, psychology and consciousness, together
with art and the humanities become integrated. AI will play an important
role in the future, but the very essence of its heterarchical algorithms
will necessitate a new kind of human work which coordinates the
universal human perception of uncertainty with technology’s generated
multiplicity of descriptions of the world. In a better world, the
business of science is not confined to a few scientists; it engages the
intellect and insight of every brain, where no account of uncertainty is
invalid: the democratisation of science, begun in the enlightenment,
finds a new level of inclusion, where the fundamental objective of
“science as a perceptual enterprise” is fully realised. Into this world,
quantum computing will present to us a world of science which works much
more like the world of human emotion and consciousness, connecting at a
deeper level to the viability of the planet on which we all live. This
is not to say that this is a future where Shakespeare’s insights into
the darker sides of human behaviour are no longer true. But it is to say
that whatever misfortunes befall individuals, society is able to keep a
covenant of care with its citizens.</p>
<p>This is a future which does not look like the present, the most telling
characteristic of which is the insecurity that has arisen from the
breaking of the covenant of social welfare that was established after
the second world war. Things may get worse before they get better,
although - as has been a theme in this book - if they do, it will feed
the political drive for transformation. Unfortunately, rarely in history
do those with an interest in maintaining inequalities cede power easily.</p>

<p>I hope to have shown the value of a cybernetic approach for the study of
education and technology. Cybernetics has given me a way of explaining
how and why education looks the way it does today. It is also generative
of a rich array of new directions for the research and development of
education. It would only be right for some of these new directions to
challenge some of the basic ideas of cybernetics, while building on its
achievements. Simondon’s work is closest in spirit to this, but there
remains much to do.</p>
<p>The fundamental issue is this: cybernetics proposes a stochastic process
at the root of life. While this process can produce remarkably life-like
results, the coherence of phenomena created by nature is of a different
order to that created by machines. Music, which is my original
discipline, provides a particularly telling example of this. So after
everything’s been said in this book, I want to add:</p>

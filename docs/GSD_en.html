<h1>Global Scientific Dialogue: Introduction For Students<a class="headerlink" href="#global-scientific-dialogue-introduction-for-students" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>University is about more than getting a degree certificate. Over the
three or four years that you are at university, there are many things
that happen which will profoundly affect the way in which your life will
develop. Very few of these things will concern knowledge of economics,
business, environmental management, or whatever it is you happen to be
studying. All of these things will involve conversations: with friends,
fellow students, teachers, girlfriends and boyfriends, flatmates,
employers, people you meet by chance, family members, bank managers,
university administrators, and so on.</p>
<p>This book guides you through a series topics for conversation about the
world today: about your future work, your hopes for career. And about
technology, science, art, creativity and interpersonal engagement. It
has been assembled in collaboration between academics from the
University of Liverpool, University of Hamburg and teachers at the Far
Eastern Federal University. Some of the perspectives come from different
disciplines: tourism, management, environment, and so on.</p>
<p>In all of these conversations, individuals come from different
backgrounds, they have different problems, they have different skills,
they have different political views, but somehow, they all have
something to offer which anyone can unlock if they really know how to
talk to each other. One of the most important skills in life is knowing
how to engage with people from many different backgrounds, skills, and
knowledge. This is a skill which cannot be taught as a single topic. It
has to be introduced as a challenge to interface with many different
ways of thinking and many disciplines. This is what Global Scientific
Dialogue will do.</p>
<p>Global Scientific Dialogue is unlike any course you will study at
University. Indeed, we think it is a unique course worldwide. To start
with, it is not a course which runs for 14 weeks, with assessments at
the end. It is a course which runs intensively for two weeks. In those
two weeks, you are going to be introduced to a rich array of different
ideas, ways of thinking, technologies and students from many different
courses in the Management School.</p>
<p>We want you to talk to each other about the things which you see and
engage with. Your teachers are not experts in any of the ideas and
fields that will be presented to you. Indeed, we don’t yet know how many
of the topics which are going to be presented to you are going to change
the world, or disappear into obscurity. Your teachers are, however,
going to encourage you to ask questions like:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What do you mean by that?</p></li>
<li><p>Can you think of an example where that isn’t true?</p></li>
<li><p>What does it mean to be ‘right’?</p></li>
<li><p>Can you think of another way of describing that?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These are questions which we should ask each other all the time. In an
uncertain world, we need to understand each others’ uncertainty. But
there is a skill to asking powerful questions, and cutting to the heart
of the issues in organisations, businesses and society that really
matter. Global Scientific Dialogue is about helping you to develop these
skills to ask powerful questions of each other.</p>

<h2>Wicked Problems<a class="headerlink" href="#wicked-problems" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In all fields of work today, individuals are dealing with complexity.
There are many problems in the modern workplace which do not appear to
have easy solutions. Sometimes these are called “wicked
problems”[&#64;rittel_dilemmas_1973]. Rittel describes Wicked Problems as:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“problems that are difficult or impossible to solve because of
incomplete, contradictory, and changing requirements that are often
difficult to recognize.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Examples of wicked problems include the management of risks in
healthcare, or the management of the environment, or in the stimulation
of innovation in an economy, or in attempts to encourage students and
staff to learn new things in a university. In none of these situations
is there a clear ‘right answer’: in all of them, there are degrees of
uncertainty with which workers have to negotiate.</p>
<p>In each of these examples, <em>wicked problems</em> present many different
dimensions: some scientific, some technological, some communicative,
some cultural, some creative, and so on. No single perspective provides
a way to dealing with the problem. The best good teams can do is to talk
and listen to each other in order to act informed by a wide range of
perspectives and disciplinary knowledge.</p>
<p>Technology is increasing the complex demands of work, and it is
ever-more important that students understand the nature of highly
complex ‘wicked problems’.</p>
<p>Creativity, flexibility, understanding of technology, communication and
the ability to communicate across many different disciplines is
extremely important in helping to ensure that wicked problems do not
become major disasters in the workplace. That means that students need
to learn new kinds of skills: it is not enough to have knowledge of a
single subject. You need to be creative, flexible, to understand
technology and to be able to communicate with many different kinds of
people.</p>
<p>Global Scientific Dialogue is a course which teaches approaches to
dealing with ‘wicked problems’. On Global Scientific Dialogue you will
encounter many ideas which lie outside your specialised subject area.
These include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Current scientific thinking in physics and biology</p></li>
<li><p>Trans-disciplinarity</p></li>
<li><p>Teamwork</p></li>
<li><p>Conversation</p></li>
<li><p>Innovative uses of technology</p></li>
<li><p>Understanding data</p></li>
<li><p>Listening</p></li>
<li><p>Creativity</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Although you have gained much disciplinary knowledge in the various
fields of management and economics, this course complements your
disciplinary knowledge by providing a way of connecting different
aspects of knowledge with your understanding and curiosity about the
real world.</p>
<p>There is no ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to this. Each of you will have
to find your own way, by tuning-in to the things that interest you.</p>
<p>This book has been prepared to help you. Although it is organised into
chapters, it is not designed to be read from cover-to-cover. Instead,
open it at a random page, and study what you see. Then open it at a
different page and study that, comparing it to what you saw before.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Each page contains a different topic.</p></li>
<li><p>Each topic has a series of questions for you to ask yourself</p></li>
<li><p>Each topic has a body of text which explains why the topic is
important</p></li>
<li><p>Each topic has links to literature and other resources to help you
think about the topic.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When you open this book, open your mind. Your brain is the most powerful
computer in the world. Let it make the connections as you let your
imagination and curiosity wander. We hope you enjoy the experience!</p>

<p><img alt="image" src="_images/techgreek.jpg" /></p>
</li>
<li><p>Technology is transforming the world of employment. Many traditional
jobs have been automated, and many of the traditional careers like
law, teaching, business and management have been fundamentally and
unrecognisably transformed by technology. Whatever career you choose
for yourself - whether teaching, medicine, stock trading, even being
an artist - it is highly likely that much of it will involve staring
at screens and working with software.</p></li>

<h2>The Computer<a class="headerlink" href="#the-computer" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>KEY QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What does the computer do to humans?</p></li>
<li><p>What has the computer done to society?</p></li>
<li><p>How can we live in harmony with computers in the future?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Technology and computers allow new forms of control over humans.</p></li>
<li><p>Computers have created a new kind of human-machine system in
society, where constraints can be very easily manipulated. We don’t
fully understand how our new human-machine system is different from
the social system of our parents.</p></li>
<li><p>Computers facilitate the manipulation of constraints. The way a
computer screen presents changing possibilities for action as we
type a phrase into a search engine, click on the hyperlinks which
are presented to us, and then negotiate whatever new possibilities
for action have been programmed into particular webpages,
illustrates the way that constraints can be changed.
<img alt="image" src="_images/alzheimers.jpg" /></p></li>
<li><p>The human experience of this process reminds us of the human-machine
system we are in: very real emotions arise in response to mechanical
processes, not dissimilar to the fundamental emotional impact of
physical constraints such as prison walls, one-way traffic systems,
central heating or alarm clocks.</p></li>
<li><p>The word ‘com-puter’ comes from latin “<em>com-putare</em>”. ‘Putare’ means
to <em>comtemplate</em> - so the computer is means of contemplating-with.
With what kind of science might we investigate this, and with what
kind of tools might we now organise ourselves?</p></li>

<h2>The Internet as a ‘Lifeworld’<a class="headerlink" href="#the-internet-as-a-lifeworld" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>KEY QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How has the computer affected what we think of as ‘real’?</p></li>
<li><p>How has the computer affected what we think of as ‘true’ or ‘false’?</p></li>
<li><p>How has the computer affected the way we feel?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The concept of ‘Lifeworld’ is a way of talking about your everyday
environment: everything that you think of as being the ‘real world’.</p></li>
<li><p>Each of us has different views of reality, and while some things
like rocks and trees appear to be universal, we only think this
because we observe others behaving in predictable ways with rocks
and trees.</p></li>
<li><p>Something happens <em>between</em> us in the ‘real world’. The word
‘intersubjective’ describes what happens between us. Husserl and
Schutz both referred to the concept of the ‘lifeworld’ as the
<em>context</em> within which intersubjective engagement occurs.
<img alt="image" src="_images/lifeworld.jpg" /></p></li>
<li><p>The computer has transformed the Lifeworld of everyone. Have our
lifeworlds become unstable? The one shared environment within which
our expectations could be coordinated has changed into multiple
lifeworlds within which individuals move in and out.</p></li>
<li><p>Even in face-to-face settings like lectures, students will often
inhabit different lifeworlds as they explore social media or other
online distractions.</p></li>

<h2>Social Media<a class="headerlink" href="#social-media" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>KEY QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What is the difference between talking on a social media forum and
talking to someone face-to-face?</p></li>
<li><p>Who do you talk to when you post on a social media forum?</p></li>
<li><p>How do you know that you have really communicated with someone on
social media?</p></li>
<li><p>How do you know you have really communicated with someone
face-to-face?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Imagine a private conversation between you and a friend: the words
one of you says are only heard by the other person, and their words
are only heard by you. Of course, they might tell others what you
said, but that would be <em>another</em> private conversation.</p></li>
<li><p>Social media expands the audience of any potential communication, so
you’re no longer talking to <em>one</em> person, but to potentially
millions.</p></li>
<li><p>When you talk face-to-face, in order to communicate, you must convey
the <em>meaning</em> of what you want to say. Sometimes you have to choose
your words carefully. You can judge whether the other person
understands by how they react to what you say. If they don’t react
as you expected, do you try and say the same thing in a different
way?</p></li>
<li><p>Is your communication successful if the way the person you are
talking to talks and behaves in a way you expect them to? This
process was theorised by a sociologist called Talcott Parsons, who
called it ‘Double
Contingency’[&#64;parsons_social_2012; &#64;luhmann_social_1996]</p></li>
<li><p>Because social media communicates with thousands of people, your
communication could be successful with <em>somebody</em> among those
thousands of people even if you don’t adjust how you say it.</p></li>
<li><p>That means that any social media communication may potentially be
successful with somebody within a networked set of possible
respondents.</p></li>

<p><strong>KEY QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">

which contains ‘noise’ of different kinds (for example, different
understandings, different cultures, etc)</p></li>

<h2>Confirmation Bias and Trolling<a class="headerlink" href="#confirmation-bias-and-trolling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>KEY QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Why has social media seen an explosion in online abuse, misogyny,
racism, trolling, stalking and fake news?</p></li>
<li><p>What is it about online communication that means that people feel
free to say things which they wouldn’t say face-to-face?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>‘Confirmation bias’ is the name given to how communications are
shaped by the communications of others.</p></li>
<li><p>Social media provides ways in which a very large audience can be
manipulated with messages which many might disagree with, but which
get passed around the internet.</p></li>
<li><p>‘Trolling’ is a form of abuse which relies on confirmation bias.
Abusive or thoughtless messages are made because a community exists
that will approve of them, but also such communities will also
approve of the disrupting effects of those messages.</p></li>
<li><p>The selection of audience over utterance or multiple description can
exacerbate political uncertainty to which institutional structures
have to react.</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes, the reaction of institutions like governments makes the
uncertainty worse.</p></li>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>When somebody invents a new tool, how often does it provide a new
way of doing something we could have done before?</p></li>
<li><p>How often does it provide a way of doing something which there was
no way of doing before?</p></li>
<li><p>Why does one technology replace another? Why do some technologies
fail to find users?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Any new technology creates a new option for doing something. A long
time ago, the only way of moving around would have been to walk, or
to ride a horse. New options were created by railways, cars, planes
and so on.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s the same with communicating: once upon a time, we would have to
have been with the person we are talking to. New options were
created by writing, printing, the telephone and the internet?
<img alt="image" src="_images/techreal.jpg" /></p></li>
<li><p>Today we have bewildering choice: whether to write a letter, an
email, a tweet, a text, a phone call?</p></li>
<li><p>Every new option for doing something creates more uncertainty in the
decision to do something: <strong>Technology creates uncertainty</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Technology can also limit our options for acting in certain ways: a
locked gate or fence can constrain where humans can move in the
world.</p></li>
<li><p>Computer systems today present users with ‘forms’ for them to fill
in information like your name, address, phone number, password, etc.
They constrain: <strong>Technology limits options</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Technology like computers do use algorithms to generate new ways of
looking at the world which without of them we would not have access
to.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Technology <em>amplifies</em> descriptions of the world.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>The computer does all of these three things at once.</strong></p></li>

<h2>Technology and Feedback<a class="headerlink" href="#technology-and-feedback" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>KEY QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In what ways are you like a robot?</p></li>
<li><p>In what ways are you like a plant?</p></li>
<li><p>How do you adapt to your environment?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The modern computer was developed in the 1940s as a consequence of
technological innovations which arose from the Second World War.</p></li>
<li><p>One of the principles of the modern computer was the concept of
<em>feedback</em>: where a system’s outputs are connected to its inputs. It
was noted that systems with feedback exhibited ‘lifelike’ behaviour,
and many scientists were fascinated by this lifelike behaviour right
at the beginning of the computer’s evolution.</p></li>
<li><p>Today’s technologies of AI and Big Data rely on feedback. More
importantly, most of the techniques and technologies of AI are not
new, but were invented at the same time as the digital computer - in
the late 1940s by some of the leading figures of cybernetics: Warren
McCulloch, Norbert Wiener, John Von Neumann</p></li>
<li><p>What is new today is that we have wired every human being on the
planet into an information network, so that the principles of
intelligence and feedback imagined in the 1940s are now operating on
human beings within this network.</p></li>
<li><p>Russian cybernetics and computing started after the death of Stalin,
who had banned cybernetics because he thought it was anti-communist.
People like Victor Glushkov were pioneers of computing in Russia.</p></li>

<h2>Decentralisation<a class="headerlink" href="#decentralisation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>KEY QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Does the internet have to be made of servers which store files
accessed by users who type web addresses?</p></li>
<li><p>What happens when one of those servers (e.g. google) stops working?</p></li>
<li><p>Is there an alternative way of organising files where they exist
everywhere, rather than a single place? What are the implications of
organising things differently?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>When the internet was developed, the idea was that every machine
should be connected to every other machine, with no central point of
control.</p></li>
<li><p>The protocol through which the web works, <em>Hyper-text Transport
Protocol</em> (http), relies on having servers which deliver documents.</p></li>
<li><p>As the web has evolved, it has reproduced the centralised structure
of society where corporations and governments have high-profile
websites. So instead of a free and open web where everyone is equal,
we have a web dominated by a few corporations.</p></li>
<li><p>Web decentalisation focuses on how to reduce the burden on single
servers by spreading files over many servers. It also looks at
distributing internet access to parts of the world where building
infrastructure isn’t viable like rural areas. It also seeks to
address citizen worries about surveillance.</p></li>
<li><p>Blockchain is one form of decentralisation, but there also emerging
technologies like the Inter-planetary file system
(<a class="reference external" href="http://ipfs.io">http://ipfs.io</a>), and a few similar decentralising protocols like
DAT (<a class="reference external" href="https://datproject.org/">https://datproject.org/</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>The hardware to support decentralisation is also developing. The
Gotenna device (see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gotenna.com/pages/mesh">https://www.gotenna.com/pages/mesh</a>) is a small
radio repeater which carries a signal for 4 miles, and can easily
form a mesh network with other Gotenna recievers in the
neighbourhood.</p></li>

<h2>Blockchain and Bitcoin<a class="headerlink" href="#blockchain-and-bitcoin" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>KEY QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is a currency possible without a central bank?</p></li>
<li><p>If an institution like a bank can be replaced with technology, what
about other institutions like universities?</p></li>
<li><p>If institutions provide trust in a currency, how does technology
establish an equal degree of trust?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>One of the functions of institutions like banks, universities or
hospitals is to provide trust in their services. People use the
institutions because they have trust in the honesty of what the
institution does.</p></li>
<li><p>A banknote, for example, usually contains a ‘promise’ by the bank to
pay the sum which is written on the paper BitCoin provides a way in
which trust can be established simply with an algorithm, rather than
requiring an institution.
<img alt="image" src="_images/blockchain.png" /></p></li>
<li><p>Equally important is that the BitCoin algorithm is a distributed
technology called a <em>Blockchain</em> which doesn’t store details of
transactions on any single server.</p></li>
<li><p>Instead, the Blockchain algorithm is a “chain of digital signatures”
which act as an open and transparent ledger of transactions in the
Bitcoin currency [&#64;nakamoto_bitcoin:_nodate]</p></li>
<li><p>The blockchain has two principal innovations which have ensured that
the ledger is trusted. Firstly, the entire blockchain - the list of
all transactions - is distributed and duplicated throughout the
internet. Secondly, the veracity of the blockchain ledger is assured
by a process called ‘mining’. This is a data-intensive process which
aims to identify any anomalies in the ledger. Mining serves a dual
purpose: whilst it ensures the ledger is accurate, it also rewards
those who find inconsistencies with the creation of new Bitcoins,
thus tying the mechanism of verification with the control of the
money supply (a function normally carried out by a central bank)

<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Simple machines with feedback can produce life-like phenomena. For a
long time, people have asked ‘Can we build an artificial brain?’</p></li>
<li><p>In the 1950s and 60s, cybernetics was the emerging discipline within
which these developments could be considered together.</p></li>
<li><p>What we now call ‘machine learning’ also belongs to this period.
Machine learning has its roots in the work of one of the pioneers of
early cybernetics, Warren McCulloch. McCulloch saw that the neural
structures of the brain were multiple interconnections. In
describing the logic of this structure, McCulloch coined the term
‘heterarchy’.</p></li>
<li><p>Neural networks have many interconnected nodes and these can be
trained to identify the different characteristics of “a thing to be
recognised”. For example, if we want a neural network to recognise a
picture of a rabbit, the network is exposed to many pictures of
rabbits (a training set). With enough pictures, it learns the
characteristics of ‘rabbit-ness’ from these so that new images of
rabbits can be successfully identified.</p></li>
<li><p>Google Translate works in a similar way: it has millions of examples
of text in different languages which it feeds into its neural
network. That learns how to convert one to the other. It also learns
from the preferences of users when they use it.</p></li>
<li><p>Machine learning depends on having thousands of items to train it.
If thousands of items are not available, machine learning is
unlikely to be very good.</p></li>

<li><p>Is it a problem that technology companies know so much about you?</p></li>
<li><p>Is it a problem that governments might know so much about you?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Everything we do online records data which is sent back to the
providers of online services we use.</p></li>
<li><p>Providers of online services adapt the service they provide to us
based on what they know about us: so if you shop on amazon for
something, you will receive adverts for that thing in other web
pages. <img alt="image" src="_images/cambridgeanalytica.jpg" /></p></li>
<li><p>This recording of personal data is unprecedented in human history:
it is not the ‘connectedness’ of people that is new with the
internet (we have always been interconnected as human beings); it is
the capacity for the strategic organisation, recall and manipulation
of data about humans to then change the behaviour of humans.</p></li>
<li><p>The collection of personal data is related to the centralisation of
the internet. If the internet was decentralised, then personal data
could be stored under the control of the individual who creates it.</p></li>
<li><p>Individuals could then sell their own data to corporations if they
wished.</p></li>

<p><strong>KEY QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What would you rather share: your Facebook/VK password or your
toothbrush?</p></li>
<li><p>In what ways do computers present you with barriers to doing things?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Technology forces us to behave in certain ways, demanding use of
electronic forms, passwords, user permissions, firewalls and so on.</p></li>
<li><p>The earliest example of the <em>form</em> was developed during the first
world war. <em>Form A2042</em> was the name given to the ‘Field Service
Post Card’, upon which soldiers could send brief messages home by
crossing-out the options which did not apply. Paul Fussell claims it
was</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>‘the progenitor of of all modern forms on which you fill in things
or cross out things or check off things, from police traffic
summonses to “questionnaires” and income-tax blanks.’
[&#64;fussell_great_2013]</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>The Field Service Post-Card is an attenuator which reinforces
control by a central authority or hierarchy (in this case, the
British army). The form’s restricted structure prevented soldiers
saying too much.</p></li>
<li><p>Hierarchies maintain themselves by attenuating the flow of
information between themselves and their environment.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="_images/a2042.jpg" /></p>
</li>
<li><p>Today’s computer forms do more than attenuate the communication of
individuals. Computer tools also <em>amplify</em> the patterns of behaviour
gained by capturing many people engaging with the form. Modern
computer technology can dynamically adapt the constraints within
which users engage with the system.</p></li>

much in common.</p></li>
<li><p>Scientists create abstractions which describe the world with
equations and models. Artists create abstractions which describe the
world in paint, light, sound, movement.</p></li>

<li><p>If you want to learn to fix a leaking tap or a fault in your car, do

<li><p>At a key moment of surprise in a video, what are the elements which

<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Video presents multiple descriptions of the world over time.</p></li>
<li><p>The multiple descriptions presented by video have many dimensions
and change over time.</p></li>
<li><p>Edgar Morin, in his book “Cinema and the imaginary man”
[&#64;morin_cinema_2005], details the different descriptions that the
cinema presents. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the way that light and shadow changes</p></li>
<li><p>the way that the size of objects change</p></li>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How is poetry like video?</p></li>
<li><p>How is poetry like science?</p></li>
<li><p>How does a poet describe something which has no name - like a
feeling?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Text appears to be a much less rich medium than video. However, in
poetry, text can be used to convey deep things which lie beyond any
individual word.</p></li>
<li><p>The way text is able to do this is by layering different
descriptions of something on top of one another.</p></li>
<li><p>In poetry, descriptions are not just in the words themselves, but in
their rhythm and in the way that they rhyme.</p></li>
<li><p>With the kind of overlaying of descriptions Ezra Pound describes how
it is that words are assembled from other words. To define ‘red’,
for example, Pound asks</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“How can the poet to do it in a picture that isn’t painted in red
paint? He puts (or his ancestor put) together the abbreviated
pictures of</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>ROSE        CHERRY
IRON RUST   FLAMINGO</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<hr class="docutils" />
<li><p>Pound argues that this</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>is very much the kind of thing a biologist does (in a very much
more complicated way) when he gets together a few hundred or
thousand slides, and picks out what is necessary for his general
statement. Something that fits the case, that applies in all of

<li><p>Much modern art now uses computers - what do the computers
contribute to artistic expression?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the difference between a computer-generated object and a
natural object?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The computer generates lights on a screen to create virtual
‘objects’. These virtual objects can be easily manipulated, and
algorithms can generate infinite variations of an object</p></li>
<li><p>Human beings point at computer-generated objects and in the process
reveal something about themselves in relation to them. Since there
are many different computer-generated objects, there are many
possible ways in which individuals might reveal something about
themselves.</p></li>
<li><p>With 3D printing, computers are able to create an increasing array
of physical objects, including paper documents, 3D printed models
and even buildings.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="_images/google-machine-learning-art.jpg" /></p>
</li>
<li><p>Practical uses of computer-generated objects include the use of
adaptive algorithms to maximise the performance of a vehicle (for
example, ‘genetic algorithms’), or the use of shared 3D
architectural plans in the design of a building (a technology known
as ‘Building Information Modelling’)</p></li>
<li><p>Virtual reality is another example of computer-generated objects

present information over time. The structure of single moment is
what is called <em>synchronic</em> and the unfolding over time is called
<em>diachronic</em> <img alt="image" src="_images/wechat.jpg" /></p></li>
<li><p>Conversations work in a similar way: they comprise diachronic and

<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>‘Individuation’ is Jung’s term for the process whereby the self
emerges from undifferentiated unconciousness.</p></li>
<li><p>The essential concept of a dynamic relation between the components
of consciousness is similar to Freud’s relation between Ego, Id and
Superego.</p></li>

is a process of drawing-out things from the subconscious into
consciousness, through turning subconscious phenomena into
communications with the therapist. Психический процесс,

<li><p>Rebalancing is essential to individuation: it is what happens when
the uncertainty of the psyche is balanced with the management of
uncertainty of social relations to the point where the individual
can see themselves as ‘whole’ and distinct from other individuals
and other things.</p></li>

<li><p>Why in conversation important for the management of uncertainty?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Uncertainty is present in the individual mind - nobody is entirely
sure of everything</p></li>
<li><p>Uncertainty is also present in the social environment: because
nobody is sure of anything, there is much argument about the meaning
of things, political issues, scientific knowledge, and so on.</p></li>
<li><p>Systems modelling techniques can help in exploring the relationship
between the management of uncertainty in the psyche and the
management of uncertainty in the environment.</p></li>
<li><p>Drawing the uncertainty management process in this way helps to
connect both the psychodynamic mechanism of Freud with the
relational mechanism of Bowlby in a coherent way. It further
suggests that the damage to attachment relations will inevitably
have psychodynamic effects.</p></li>
<li><p>The struggle to manage uncertainty with regard to proximity to a
caregiver must be related to some deeper uncertainty concerning the
undifferentiated experience of a baby (and indeed, the mother), and
the more concrete ‘categories’ of experience which arise whereby
‘proximity’ becomes a thing over which the child attempts to
exercise control. In this way, the undifferentiated subconscious of
the baby and the mother, and the mechanism by which the uncertainty
of the subconscious is managed form a coherent part of the
attachment process.</p></li>

however, is an object which functions by revealing something of the

</li>
<li><p>A gift is an invitation to reveal individual uncertainty to one
another, bringing it into the social domain where conversation can

</ul>
<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Life is cellular. But what is a cell? In school we learn that
biology is a very different subject from physics. Biology concerns
living processes, feedback, homeostasis, and so on. Physics concerns
eternal mechanical laws. We accept that biological systems are made
of atoms and molecules, but the connection between the processes of
the mechanisms of atoms and molecules and the living processes of a
growing embryo are shrouded in mystery.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="quantum_biology.jpg" /></p>
</li>
<li><p>What would science look like if we saw biology and physics as one?
The impact of Quantum mechanics on biological systems is exciting a
lot of interest at the moment, as biological phenomena such as
sensation are being successfully explained by Quantum phenomena.</p></li>
<li><p>DNA is a molecule which, biology tells us, is <em>about</em> other
molecules. That means the molecules in DNA <em>refer to</em> the molecules
in proteins which are expressed by it. How can a molecule be about
another molecule? Where did that begin?</p></li>
<li><p>In both biology and physics there are a large number of basic things
which we do not know. What happens at the quantum level? What is
mass, time or space? Everyone talks about ‘energy’ - but what’s
that? Why is it that everything in nature appears to be meshed
together - planets, plants, stars, man, consciousness?</p></li>

<li><p>Why are humans so short-sighted in their development of new
technologies?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In the early 1970s, Cohen and March developed a model of
organisational decision-making called the ‘Garbage can model of
organisational choice’ [&#64;cohen_garbage_1972]. This model described
how humans rarely solve complex problems, but instead try to turn
complex problems into easy problems by deciding to implement some
technology which was already in existence. Cohen and March
highlighted that this was often a cause of greater complexity and
unmanageability.</p></li>
<li><p>When humans make decisions, either at an individual level, or at the
level of corporations, governing bodies, ministerial agencies,
political conferences, international agreements or pressure groups,
brains come together to coordinate a collective course of action
suitable for the group.</p></li>
<li><p>Damage persists upheld by webs of institutions, including
universities, each seeking to uphold their identity and mission,
including students who qualify from universities.</p></li>
<li><p>Decisions are made within constraints. There are the immediate
constraints which include the available information about the
situation, the skills and capabilities of individuals, psychology,
technological resources, and communication channels for coordinating
action.</p></li>
<li><p>More subtle constraints include power relations within the
decision-making group and the broader political background of
decision-making.</p></li>
<li><p>Decisions are made in an inter-subjective context, even when they
are the decisions by an individual for their own needs. For example,
students faced with choosing a subject or an institution must deal
with multiple constraints, amongst which include information about
judgements by others as to their suitability to a particular course,
information about career prospects, information about alternatives,
information about costs, as well as self-evaluation of desires,
uncertainties, commitment and motivation.</p></li>

more efficient, safer and cheaper.</p></li>

and the prevention of conflict have not been so spectacular.</p></li>
<li><p>The technological gain of increased efficiency produce systematic
problems elsewhere: cars turns the ground to tarmac, pollutes the
air with fumes and noise, causes congestion, results in the
travelling of increasing distances and creates a pathological
obsession with speed.</p></li>
<li><p>A previous generation of fast cars creates new uncertainty which

</ul>
<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>After the advances in physics in the 20^th^ century, computers have
become essential tools for calculating probabilities rather than
definite objective observations.</p></li>
<li><p>By the 1940s, computers were being used to calculate the solutions
to the statistical equations of Boltzmann and Gibbs: theoretical
development could be accelerated with mechanical aids to
computation.</p></li>
<li><p>In the years to the present day, the computer has transformed
science to the point of dominating it. The sophistication of
statistical analysis has been exploited in crunching ever-vaster
amounts of data (such as the human genome) producing new patterns
and descriptions which reveal new insights.</p></li>
<li><p>Computer-generated models appear to imitate nature displaying
predictive power in their behaviour without any underlying
hypothesis, and results of search routines upon the vast database of
resources on the web can easily create the impression that the world
<em>is</em> the internet.</p></li>
<li><p>This has led to an instrumentalisation of scientific inquiry.
Advances in machine learning, off-the-shelf software for crunching
social science data, modelling tools from engineering to biology
create a scientific environment where inability to control the
available software is a greater hindrance to professional success
than the inability to think critically about what is being
experienced.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Nobody knows what information is: there is no coherent definition
which unites information in DNA with information in the computer, or
information in physics.</p></li>
<li><p>Yet the sequencing of information in DNA and genetics is now a huge
industry. Most of this work is dominated by large-scale
computer-driven research. There are worries that this focus on
computer-driven research will drive out the space for thinking or
rethinking the way in which life works. In a recent article, Amos
argues that the computer-dominated ‘big science’ is something we
should all worry about because:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“genome sequencing offers little science training because most of
the work is done by machines and technicians … it is the
antithesis of good science, being largely hypothesis-free and
involving little experimental design. Why are we placing our few
remaining publicly funded eggs into proportionately fewer and
fewer baskets?”[&#64;noauthor_big_2013]</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Utopian visions for the future of science envisage the
ever-increasing power of machine learning and Big data producing
answers to fundamental scientific and social problems. On closer
inspection, the results of such massive computation, such as the
analysis of genetic samples, or the analysis of human behaviour on
social media, does little more than amplify the work of thousands of
humans were they to endure the boredom of sitting around counting
things.</p></li>

<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In the theory of information, the symbol grounding problem refers to
the inability to account for the emergence of signs and tokens
(words) with referents from basic principles without recourse to
apriori distinctions.</p></li>
<li><p>The description of abstract mechanisms which show how structures of
data can emerge and form the basis of very simple languages has been
elusive, although there have been some interesting attempts by
Holland (see his ‘echo’ model) and Floridi.
<img alt="image" src="_images/symbolgrounding.jpg" /></p></li>
<li><p>The symbol grounding problem is fundamentally a problem within the

discrete symbols from basic principles is not dissimilar from the
emergence of discrete forms from basic principles. They might well
be one and the same!</p></li>

</ul>
<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>

<li><p>Emotions do not appear to be merely in the brain.</p></li>
<li><p>There appear to be connections between the waves of emotion that
moves through a person on hearing a music, grieving for the death of
a loved one, gazing into a lover’s eyes, cheering at a football
match, and so on.</p></li>
<li><p>Each effect, as a change to the state of a person, will have a
consequent experience associated with it, and each state will
therefore tend to move to another state. In moments of intense
emotional experience, like bursting into tears, the physical effects
of this rushing through us have real physical side-effects.</p></li>

<li><p>Bateson argues that Lamarck’s basic idea of the ‘inheritance of
acquired characteristics’, whilst being on the surface wrong, was
the first to consider the question of ‘mind’ from first principles,
using ‘habit’ as one of his axioms. Mind was emergent from habit

<li><p>Should we think about the details of particular phenomena, or should
we think about how the whole universe gives rise to particular
phenomena?</p></li>
<li><p>How can a cosmology be verified?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The result of analytical thinking is a deeper cosmology about why
the universe is the way it is</p></li>
<li><p>Such cosmologies characterise the work of scientific revolutionaries
like Newton, Galileo, Einstein. In each case, they radically rethink
the story of the universe.</p></li>
<li><p>In order to comprehend what underlying mechanisms are, one has to
see <em>beyond</em> what is immediately perceived.</p></li>
<li><p>Synthetic approaches to science, rather than analytical approaches,
dominate most of what goes by the name of ‘research’ in
universities: in physics, a unified theory has been the goal for
many generations of physicists who have attempted to unify quantum
mechanics with relativity and Newtonian mechanics: so far the
approach has failed. In biology, synthesis leads to the variety of
specialised theories of epigenesis and genetics.</p></li>
<li><p>As with physics, nothing coherent has yet emerged, and indeed there
is no explanation for the ways in which cells organise to produce
hearts, brains and fingers. In medicine, synthetic methods gather
evidence of ‘markers’ for disease from genetics, neurology,
endocrinology, and so on, and then seeks to explain disease through
the presence of markers.</p></li>
<li><p>It should not therefore surprise us to know that research efforts
into learning and education (of which biological, physical and
physiological theories are a subset) lack coherence and explanatory
power.</p></li>

</ul>
<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The founder of phenomenology, Edmund Husserl, realised that in order
to study consciousness it was impossible to escape the problem that
whatever an <em>individual</em> consciousness was (and the very idea of
<em>individual</em> is problematic) the consciousness of one mind was
<em>relative</em> to another.</p></li>
<li><p>Husserl considered the idea of consciousness <em>between</em> people, or
what he called <em>intersubjectivity</em>. He argued that consciousness
emerged between minds in a shared environment, or ‘lifeworld’.</p></li>
<li><p>Husserl was primarily focused on the structure of consciousness and
his idea of intersubjectivity was framed around the face-to-face
interaction between two people. Broader relations to society,
contemporaries and ancestors were not considered.</p></li>
<li><p>However, consciousness is between people face-to-face, and between
people who are not with us immediately, with material objects in the
world (like computers), and maybe even between the minds of the
living and the minds of dead (how could we know?)</p></li>
<li><p>Often neuroscience identifies the mind inside the head: in doing so,
it presupposes an objective world of ‘mind’ beyond the mind that
makes the observation through MRI scanners!</p></li>

<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Alfred Schutz made a connection between Husserl’s intersubjectivity
and Weber’s sociology. Weber, in defining sociology as “a science
concerning itself with the interpretive understanding of social
action and thereby with a causal explanation of its course and
consequences” [&#64;weber_economy_1978] lacked a theory of human
understanding, and didn’t go into much detail about the ways in
which human communication occurs.</p></li>
<li><p>Schutz saw Husserl’s attempt to describe intersubjectivity as a
corrective to this: a comprehensive theory of mind that could be
united with a theory of social life. However, Schutz felt that
Husserl’s account of intersubjectivity was deficient since Husserl’s
main focus in considering intersubjectivity is one-to-one close
relations, and ignores the broader dimension of what Schutz called
the “world of others”.</p></li>
<li><p>world of others, according to Schutz, involves a range of different
kinds of intersubjective relations, from intimate face-to-face
relations, to distance relations with ‘contemporaries’.</p></li>
<li><p>The online world presents a clear distinction between face-to-face
engagement and more distant relations. Schutz himself distinguished
between between face-to-face engagement, or what he called a “pure
we-relation”, and engagement at a distance. He identified what he
called a ‘spectrum of vividness’, arguing that the difference
between the face-to-face world and what he calls the “world of
contemporaries” can be illustrated by the experience of ending a
face-to-face encounter:</p></li>

<h2>Communication and Expectation<a class="headerlink" href="#communication-and-expectation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>KEY QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can you communicate with someone if you have no idea of what they
think?</p></li>
<li><p>When you email somebody, who are you talking to?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The sociologist Talcott Parsons sought to develop Schutz’s ideas
about expectation into a more systematic theory of human
communication, arguing that what happens in communication was a
process of what he calls ‘<em>double
contingency</em>’[&#64;parsons_social_2012]. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span>’s expectations of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span>’s
behaviour in response to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span>’s utterances are mirrored by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span>’s
expectations of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> behaviour to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span>’s utterances. In an extended
correspondence between them, Parsons and Schutz wrestle between a
systematic and systems-theoretical characterisation of communication
(which was what Parsons sought) and a phenomenological and more
subtle characterisation of the development of consciousness in
communication (which Schutz was aiming for) [&#64;grathoff_theory_1978].</p></li>
<li><p>What Schutz refers to as a “decreasing number of perceptions”
suggests that each of the sensory ‘channels’ which carry alternative
descriptions of the encounter are degraded with distance. What is
constructed from these multiple descriptions is, Schutz suggests (in
line with Husserl), a set of expectations about the communication
situation without which the making of utterances would be
impossible. In other words, I can only write these words now because
I have some expectation of the experience of you as a reader.</p></li>
<li><p>The meaning of my words is therefore dependent on the coordination
of expectations between people who communicate: Husserl called these
sets of expectations ‘horizons of meaning’, and so it can be said
that what is communicated are not words but expectations or
meanings.</p></li>
<li><p>Schutz does not suggest that the process of ‘coordinating
expectations’ does <em>not</em> happen at a distance, but he does suggest
that the mechanisms by which meanings are established and
coordinated between people are different in the situation where
there is face-to-face contact, and where there is no physical
co-presence.</p></li>
<li><p>Schutz’s analysis presents some fascinating questions: might he say
that a ‘pure we-relation’ is still possible at a distance using a
medium of communication (say Skype) which does not decrease the
number of perceptions?</p>

<li><p>What happens when we listen somebody carefully?</p></li>
<li><p>After listening, how do we formulate a response?</p></li>
<li><p>Can we teach people to listen better?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Dialogue involves listening to a greater extent than it does talking</p></li>
<li><p>In dialogue there is not necessarily a free choice of talking: what
is said is said in the context of what is understood by what is
heard by others.</p></li>
<li><p>Dialogue articulates a structure which has many levels: a
conversations about an object produces a conversation about the
conversation about the object, or a conversation about the
conversation about the conversation about an object. These different
levels of discourse shift over time. What emerges are different
discrete strata of construction.</p></li>
<li><p>David Bohm believed that at its best, dialogue reflected deeper
structures in the universe. The multiple strata of patterns of
engagement in dialogue help us to perceive something deeper.</p></li>
<li><p>Objects can help with the process of dialogue. When an object is
presented (for example a photograph), it invites many different
descriptions from different people. When these descriptions are
brought together, it produces a richer picture not just of the
object, but of the different people who makes descriptions about it.</p></li>
<li><p>Teachers are particularly skilled in generating multiple
descriptions of the same thing. The process of teaching is a process
of generating redundancy: the teacher may say “think about it like
this”, or “here’s an example”, or “let me tell you a story about
this”, or “What do you think?” (which is an invitation to multiple
descriptions produced by others.</p></li>
<li><p>Encouraging people to listen requires encouraging people to see the
importance of multiple descriptions of things rather than being
focused on a single ‘correct’ description. Science is partly to
blame for presenting the world in a single description. Modern
physics actually tells us that this isn’t how things are.</p></li>

<li><p>What are the factors which help alleviate unhappiness?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Unhappiness may have a systemic explanation. In the study of animal
behaviour, it became clear that the relationship between mothers and
babies was a systemic relation. If mothers were separated from
babies, then the result was distress.</p></li>
<li><p>Konrad Lorenz, who was the pioneer of this work, projected his
findings on to the human world:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The competition between human beings destroys with cold and
diabolic brutality… Under the pressure of this competitive fury
we have not only forgotten what is useful to humanity as a whole,
but even that which is good and advantageous to the individual.
[…] One asks, which is more damaging to modern humanity: the
thirst for money or consuming haste… in either case, fear plays
a very important role: the fear of being overtaken by one’s
competitors, the fear of becoming poor, the fear of making wrong
decisions or the fear of not being up to snuff…
[&#64;lorenz_aggression_2002]</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>In Lorenz’s work with geese, he noticed how the movement of chicks
maintained proximity to the mother. He called this mechanism of
maintaining proximity ‘imprinting’ and explored its parameters by
replacing real mothers with a wire-frame model which was presented
to the chicks within hours of hatching: as a consequence, the baby
chicks maintained proximity to this object as if it was the mother.
It was a cybernetic experiment where theoretical models and
empirical evidence combined convincingly.</p></li>
<li><p>Does this suggest that emotions such as unhappiness, grief, anger
have their roots in the systemic relation between the child and the
parent? More broadly, it may suggest that the relationship between
the organism and the environment is the critical determiner of
emotion.</p></li>
<li><p>If this is the case, then it suggests that issues of experience of
emotion have a connection to political issues in the social
environment: what R.D. Laing calls the ‘Politics of Experience’

</ul>
<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>John Bowlby stated that ” the child’s tie to his mother is a product
of the activity of a number of behavioural systems that have
proximity to mother as a predictable outcome.”</p></li>
<li><p>He suggested that “young children, who for whatever reason are
deprived of the continuous care and attention of a mother or a
substitute-mother, are not only temporarily disturbed by such
deprivation, but may in some cases suffer long-term effects which
persist” [&#64;bowlby_effects_1956]</p></li>
<li><p>Bowlby called his mechanism ‘attachment’ and expressed it in
cybernetic terms: “What principles of organisation are necessary if
behaviour is to attain these ends?”. In stating his organisational
principle, Bowlby sets the stage for an analysis of personality
arising from mechanisms of early life relations and the
organisational dynamics of development. He focused particularly on
the relationship between the child and the mother - although the
issue is really about the principal caregiver of whichever sex.</p></li>
<li><p>The demonstration of the thesis demanded attention on what happened
if the proximity to the mother is <em>not</em> a predictable outcome. What
happened where the mother or father rejected the child’s affection,
or attachments were affected by death or drastic changes in
circumstance? In exploring this, Bowlby turns to some of the
fundamental problems of psychoanalysis.</p></li>
<li><p>The consequence of this view was that human behaviour had to be
studied <em>relationally</em>. Humans were not individuals, but
inter-connected systems: recent research work of addiction supports
his findings. [&#64;flores_addiction_2011].</p></li>

<li><p>The content of communication is information that the teacher offers

<li><p>German Sociologist Ulrich Beck argued that we now live in a ‘risk
society’, where risks are manufactured both in the creation of new
technologies, and in the creation of new risks in the law, the
economy, and education.</p></li>
<li><p>Beck argues that the distribution of risks is not even: those at the
bottom of society are subject to far more risks, with far fewer
means of addressing them, than those at the top.</p></li>
<li><p>He argues that there is a connection between risk and education:
that new technologies create new requirements to learn to use new
tools, which increases the risk of not being qualified.</p></li>
<li><p>Furthermore, Beck argues that education itself becomes a risk:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“Everywhere educational reform is accompanied by a dependence on
education. More and more groups get caught up in the race for
educational credentials. As a result there emerge new internal
differentiations. Whilst these may still respond to traditional
differences between groups, the impact of education makes them
fundamentally different from traditional ones. […] In
conjunction with novel patterns of upward and downward mobility
and increasing local labour mobility as well, new hierarchies and
differentiations develop which are internal to social classes.
They presuppose the expansion of the service sector and the
creation of new occupations.”[&#64;beck_risk_1992]</p>

<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>There is much confusion about what education is and there is no
coherent theory of it.</p></li>
<li><p>Education may be often boring because we have a bad theory of
education. If we had a better theory, then learning would perhaps be
more in tune with the way that human consciousness works.</p></li>
<li><p>Boredom itself is a reaction to a kind of oppression.</p></li>
<li><p>The topic of education itself is not of the same kind as the topics
of physics, maths or chemistry. Sociologist Everett Hughes argued
that education was not a discipline but rather “a major complex of
arts”. He explains that it is not a discipline:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“in the sense of offering a single order of phenomena which, when
observed and/or manipulated in a systematic way, yield a body of
consistent theory. In this respect, education is like the other
great practical arts - looking after the sick, keeping order, and
distributing justice. All of them, however, give rise to a variety
of disciplines and, in turn, use many of their results. These arts
are the very springs of human curiosity; they are also great
consumers of man’s best intellectual and scientific efforts. None
of these arts, moreover, is ever completely under the control of
the human will, the will of one man or of some small group of men,
or even of society at large through its instruments. Yet control
over these arts is sought in all societies. The manner of
practicing them is the very stuff of the clash of wills and
interests; thus, the stuff of
politics.”[&#64;hughes_sociological_1985]</p>

</li>
<li><p>Hughes’s distinction between a ‘discipline’ and a ‘complex of arts’
is helpful in the sense that it causes us to ask whether there is a
‘body of consistent theory’ about education</p></li>

<li><p>How is one distinction related to another?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Drawing a distinction between one thing and another is always the
first (and essential) step in being able to study something.
Distinctions are made about biological species, artistic forms,
philosophical positions, times of day, colours, or sounds and
movements. Education feeds on distinctions. To study education is to
study the way distinctions are made and the dynamics of their
interaction.</p></li>
<li><p>A distinction is a boundary. It constrains one set of things as
belonging to one group, and another set of things as belonging to a
different group. In making a distinction about red butterflies, a
line is drawn and criteria established to identify whether a
particular object belongs on the side of the line which says ‘red
butterflies’ and everything else not a red butterfly. The red
butterfly distinction is marked by constraining what does not meet
the criteria (other distinctions) for a red butterfly. A distinction
is a <em>choice</em> of a constraint. The choosing, however, is itself
constrained by other things: for example, norms, values,
institutions, education and individual expectations.</p></li>
<li><p>Every distinction exists within distinctions at a different level.
We might make the distinction about butterflies, but where are the
distinctions made about the scientific or aesthetic norms, values
and expectations within which the butterfly distinction is made? To
explore distinction-making as a process, we have to become aware of
both sides of the distinction in order to see the complex structures
of hierarchies which might be at work in establishing even the
simplest judgements about reality.</p></li>
<li><p>In education we draw a distinction much like the distinction which
Hughes tries to draw. If we want to say education is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y\)</span> or
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z\)</span>, then a distinction is drawn with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z\)</span> in a box, and
everything that isn’t <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> outside the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> box Then we can say that
everything outside <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> constrains the definition of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>.
Distinctions become <em>drawable</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>In a simple way, Hughes distinction between Education as a complex
of arts and what he calls ‘disciplines’ can be drawn as in Figure
<a class="reference external" href="#fig:educationconstraint">[fig:educationconstraint]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:educationconstraint”}.</p>
<p><img alt="Hughes's defininition of education within uncertainconstraints[]{label=&quot;fig:educationconstraint&quot;}" src="noteducation" />{#fig:educationconstraint

</li>
<li><p>Drawing it like this immediately raises questions. The arrows
between the disciplines in the diagram show a relationship which is
not clear in Hughes’s description. <em>Maths</em> and <em>Physics</em> have a
relation to <em>education</em>. Education shapes what they are: so
shouldn’t they be <em>within</em> the education box? But also Maths and
physics have a relationship to each other: mathematical techniques
like calculus derived from new theories in physics and astronomical
observations. So this diagram isn’t very satisfactory - but the lack
of clarity in Hughes’s description becomes apparent through trying
to draw it as a diagram.</p></li>

<li><p>How does society change over time?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If there are many possible distinctions about ‘maths’, ‘education’,
‘hospitals’ or ‘chairs’ how it is that we maintain relatively stable
distinctions in society? There must be a process which is
responsible for maintaining a coherent and agreed set of
distinctions around which we coordinate our social lives, our
education system, our scientific practice, and so on. Cybernetics
gives a name name to the process of maintaining a distinction: it is
<em>transduction</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>In engineering, transduction is the process of taking one form of
energy and turning it into another - like an electric transformer or
a heat exchanger. In those examples, and in every other example of
transduction, what results is a boundary - or a distinction.</p></li>
<li><p>The transduction process works on both sides of a distinction. By
recognising that distinctions are maintained by a process is to
recognise that the process may change - and a change to the
distinction-making process at one level can lead to changes in the
distinction-making process at many other levels too. To change a
social system - or indeed any system - we have to ‘tweak the
transducers’!</p></li>
<li><p>All distinctions are the result of transduction processes.</p></li>
<li><p>Societies change when their distinctions about themselves change,
and this changes when the structure of their transductions change.</p></li>

<li><p>The role of the target quantitative criterion in this case can be
performed by an indicator of investment activity (the result of cash

negative cash flows, analyze the relationship between the cash flow
balance of current operations and net profit (loss).</p></li>
<li><p>The dynamics of changes in profit should correspond to the change in
the balanced cash flows from the current activity. To maximize
profits, it is necessary to minimize material costs and ensure the

<li><p>The financial strategy of the company should be developed taking
into account the risk of non-payments, inflation spikes and other

<li><p>Financial control is necessary for the timely identification of
internal reserves, improving the profitability of the economy,
increasing cash savings in the enterprise. Many of these require a
consideration of external factors.</p></li>
<li><p>The use of an integrated automated management system for the

<li><p>In the era of globalization, tourism acts as a link in the
intercultural development and mutual understanding between peoples.</p></li>
<li><p>Tourism as a sphere of recreation is in interrelation with the
environment. Recreational areas are very fragile, vulnerable,
resources are exhausted.</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes spontaneous, uncontrolled development of tourism creates a

professionals, the understanding of related scientific branches
necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>As a sphere of the economy, tourism is an active source of
replenishment of the revenue side of budgets of different levels,
has a multiplying effect on related industries.</p></li>
<li><p>In the tourist professional activity the leading role is occupied by
management. Management in the field of tourism has a specific
nature, because a tourist product is, first of all, a service
product that requires a system approach to management, which is
oriented to the development of the human resource of the enterprise
and is “sharpened” for the interests of the client.</p></li>

<li><p>The distinction between an organism and its environment is
maintained through a process of attenuation of the environment by
the organism, and the amplification of organism’s attenuations
through the production of multiple descriptions of it. Any organism
must somehow coordinate which parts of its operations to attenuate
the environment. This means that as part of the organism there must
be a higher-level function which examines the function of the
organism’s operations and attempts to coordinate them.</p></li>

<p><strong>KEY QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Why are hierarchies a bad idea in an uncertain environment?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>All hierarchies work on the principle of attenuation: attenuation
from the environment to the system, and attenuation from bottom to
top.</p></li>
<li><p>The boss cannot absorb information about the detail about what is
happening in the environment or on the ground: they have to work
with an abstract representation of reality.</p></li>
<li><p>In a highly uncertain and complex environment, this means that a
hierarchy is not able to absorb the complexity of its environment or
its operation, and so its self-adaptation does not work effectively.
Instead, the instinct of hierarchies is to defend themselves by
becoming more authoritarian.</p>
<p><img alt="Two dimensions of attenuation in the organisation: From bottom totop (vertical), and from the environment to the individual(horizontal)" src="Slide2" />{width=”columnwidth”}</p>
</li>
<li><p>There exist approaches to organisation which avoid the problems of
hierarchy. Whilst attenuation is necessary for any system to manage
any other system of greater complexity than itself, recursive
distinction-making can create a dynamically adaptive system whose
operations in its environment are continually adapted according to
the difference between the attenuations and the actual behaviour of
the environment.</p></li>
<li><p>Whilst recursion is the key to effective adaptive behaviour and each
level of transduction has the same structure as every other, each
level of recursion attenuates and amplifies different differences.
Because of this, recursive transduction structures lead to what can
be identified as differences in <em>function</em> at different levels of
recursion.</p></li>
<li><p>This second point is important when considering educational
institutions. The environment of teachers is different from the
environment of learners, or the environment of the institution’s
accountants, or its managers. Each functional unit makes different
attenuations and amplifications based on the information presented
to it by lower levels, and presents different information to high
levels of transduction.</p></li>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Living systems anticipate changes in their environment. If they did
not do this, they would be unable to react to threats.</p></li>
<li><p>Biologists including Robert Rosen [&#64;rosen_anticipatory_2012] and
mathematicians including Daniel Dubois [&#64;dubois_computing_1998] have
studied the phenomena which described a complex dynamic system
whereby what is anticipated depends on a simultaneous processing of:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>what has happened in the past</p></li>
<li><p>a model of what is happening</p></li>
<li><p>speculation on possible models of what might be happening, and
what might be possible.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Dubois has elaborated this process using three simple equations
equations showing how the dynamic interaction between what he calls
a ‘recursive’ equation <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((1)\)</span>, an ‘incursive’ equation <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((2)\)</span> and a

[&#64;dubois_computing_1998]. <img alt="image" src="_images/dubois2.jpg" /></p></li>
<li><p>Consciousness may operate according to these principles making us
‘reflexive systems’. Such a system as a ‘conscious’ system would
continually and simultaneously be processing what is happening
around us (1), thinking about why what is happening is happening
(2), and considering and evaluating alternative explanations for why
things are happening, and what might happen next (3).</p></li>

<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>At this point we must be clear about how a ‘system’ is to be
defined. Our first impulse is to point at the pendulum and to say,
the system is that thing there. This method, however, has a
fundamental disadvantage: every material object contains no less
than an infinity of variables and therefore of possible systems. The
real pendulum, for instance, has not only length and position; it
has also mass, temperature, electric conductivity, crystalline
structure, chemical impurities, some radioactivity, velocity,
reflecting power, tensile strength, a surface film of moisture,
bacterial contamination, an optical absorption, elasticity, shape,
specific gravity and so on and on. Any suggestion that we should
study ‘all’ the facts is unrealistic, and actually the attempt is
never made. What is necessary is that we should pick out and study
the facts that are relevant to some main interest that is already
given … The system now means, not a thing, but a list of
variables. [&#64;ashby_introduction_1956]</p></li>
<li><p>The word ‘complex’, as it may be applied to systems, has many
possible meanings, and I must first make my use of it clear. There
is no obvious or preeminent meaning, for although all would agree
that the brain is complex and a bicycle simple, one has also to
remember that to a butcher the brain of a sheep is simple while a
bicycle, if studied exhaustively (as the only clue to a crime) may
present a very great quantity of significant detail. Without further
justification, I shall follow, in this paper, an interpretation of
‘complexity’ that I have used and found suitable for about ten
years. I shall measure the degree of ‘complexity’ by the quantity of
information required to describe the vital system. To the
neurophysiologist the brain, as a feltwork of fibers and a soup of
enzymes, is certainly complex; and equally the transmission of a
detailed description of it would require much time. To a butcher the
brain is simple, for he has to distinguish it from only about thirty
other ‘meats’, so not more than log2 30, i.e., about five bits, are
involved. This method admittedly makes a system’s complexity purely
relative to a given observer; it rejects the attempt to measure an
absolute, or intrinsic, complexity; but this acceptance of
complexity as something in the eye of the beholder is, in my
opinion, the only workable way of measuring complexity. (Ashby,
1973 - “Some peculiarities of Complex Systems”, Cybernetic
Medicine, Vol 9, no. 1)</p></li>

<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Cybernetics was originally defined as ‘<em>the art and science of
control in man and machine</em>’[&#64;wiener_cybernetics:_2013]. We have
however, spoken of conversation being a dance, and that the dance
can either flow, or it can break down - sometimes necessitating the
teacher to recalibrate their approach. This issue of <em>dancing</em> and
conversation is precisely the same as the issue of <em>control</em>.
Unfortunately however, the word ‘control’ has some unpleasant
associations with coercion, a loss of free will, authoritarianism,
and so on. Yet all of those cases are characterised by a <em>lack</em> of
control. So we require a more precise definition of control.</p></li>
<li><p>Stafford Beer explains the cybernetic sense of control like this:
“Control is an attribute of a system. This word is not used in the
way in which either an office manager or a gambler might use it; it
is used as a name for <em>connectiveness</em>.”[&#64;beer_cybernetics_1965]</p></li>
<li><p>Control can be thought of in the context of two people dancing.
Control simply refers to the manifest <em>connection</em> between dancers
whose moves complement each other, and who participate in a whole
system which exhibits coherence in its behaviour. Control is evident
in two people having a conversation in which they are both deeply
committed and involved. It is also evident in a game of football
between two teams, or between two people playing a game of chess.</p></li>
<li><p>Cybernetics was originally developed in the 1940s as an approach to
studying the dynamics of mechanical control systems. Norbert
Wiener’s mechanical control problem was how to shoot incoming
aircraft. The mechanical problem involved feedback: the incoming
object’s position and trajectory would change, and as it did, so the
calibration of the counter-measures had to be adjusted. The incoming
aircraft and the missile targetting system engaged in a dance.</p></li>

<li><p>Biological processes work against the second law of thermodynamics,
creating order in plants and animals, where metabolism produces
order through consuming food, and thought produces increase order in
our brains. Schroedinger argued that this was a fundamental
principle of life processes: they work against increasing disorder
(or <em>entropy</em>). Life is about *neg-*entropy:</p>

<h2>Communicating Uncertainty<a class="headerlink" href="#communicating-uncertainty" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>KEY QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If modern science is driven by calculations of probability, how sure
can we be that anything is right?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the difference between the status of scientific knowledge in
the enlightenment and science today?</p></li>
<li><p>How should we communicate our uncertainties?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In 1763 the journal system of blind peer review was designed as a
democratic mechanisms to establish truth through discursive
engagement with reports of the empirical regularities of Newtonian
science.</p></li>
<li><p>The journal article was well-suited to amplifying the detailed
description of apparatus, method and results from which speculation
about causes could follow.</p></li>
<li><p>Communication of the probabilistic and contingent nature of modern
science is poorly achieved through the academic journal article.
When the probabilistic modelling of economics or patterns in DNA,
the analysis of big data, or the investigation of quantum fields or
the study of ecologies is represented in the journal literature, the
reported statistically significant results (reported through
p-values and statistical hypothesis) often mask the more significant
uncertainties surrounding the work.</p></li>
<li><p>There have been attempts to address this. New models of peer-review
have been introduced alongside new models of open access publishing
[&#64;anderson_open_2004].</p></li>
<li><p>More interesting is the demand to make publishing much more
flexible, embracing things like blogs, and (particularly) the
publishing of data.</p></li>
<li><p>Equally, the engagement of a wider community with scientific
research in initiatives like ‘Citizen Science’ are more powerful
ways of coordinating the uncertainties of a much wider section group
of people, not all of whom will be professional scientists.</p></li>
<li><p>Such democratisation in the communication of uncertainty is closer
in spirit to the original ideals that led to the establishment of
the academic journal in the first place.</p></li>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is science possible in an unfree society?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the relation between science and freedom?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the most effective relation between government and science?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The academic journal system was a method of democratising science:
it was important in the establishing of knowledge that experiments
could be done by many people, and results discussed openly.</p></li>
<li><p>Before the Royal Society published its transactions in 1667
(considered to be the first academic journal), publication was not
considered something that scientists ought to do.</p></li>
<li><p>Publishing facilitated the formation of large-scale scientific
communities within which reproducible empirical results could be
reported and discussed. Publication practice gradually took on the
form that we now know it.</p></li>
<li><p>The Royal Society’s practices of peer review was a change not only
in scientific practice and epistemology, but also in the
democratisation of intellectual status acquisition. Publication and
admittance to the academy was technically available to all.</p></li>
<li><p>One of the principles behind this democratising process was that all
evidence of scientific phenomena should be considered, whether it
conformed with existing theories or not. This openness to challenge
was an essential ingredient in the advancement of science.</p></li>
<li><p>Today, science is often presented in school as being in a late stage
of advancement where some things are now beyond doubt. Alongside
this, governments promote science as an essential ingredient to
economic development.</p></li>
<li><p>Yet, history tells us that scientific advance usually occurs by
overturning things which were once thought to be obviously true, and
that this is sometimes seen as a political challenge to those
institutions which have built their reputation on the old way of
doing things (e.g. Galileo)</p></li>
<li><p>Government promotion of openness in science, and acceptance of the
possibility that a different way of looking at things is possible,
also requires government to be open to the potential political
challenge that science presents.</p></li>
<li><p>Many current debates, about climate change, genetic engineering,
artificial intelligence, etc, all have a political side, and all
tend to adopt accepted positions which may be open to challenge.</p></li>

<h2>Publishing<a class="headerlink" href="#publishing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>KEY QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Why, when there are so many technologies for communicating, do
scientists continue to publish in academic journals (in the same way
since 1663?)</p></li>
<li><p>How can uncertainties been communicated in print?</p></li>
<li><p>Are we saying more and more about less and less?</p></li>
<li><p>Whose uncertainty about science isn’t relevant to inquiry?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For academics, publication in high ranking research journals brings
the prospect of promotion and potential job security in what is
increasingly an insecure profession (maybe to ‘tenured professor’ or
its equivalent - another status declaration within the institution),
or it brings increased funding within the institution. Institutions
with many academics producing high-ranking research papers perform
more highly in international rankings of institutions, which in turn
increase their chances of winning research funding and recruiting
high calibre students.</p></li>
<li><p>Each declaration of status is also a declaration of scarcity, and
the principal mode of operation of the institution is the declaring
of knowledge and accreditation for knowing to be scarce. This sits
at odds with the growth of technologies which provide access to
knowledge everywhere. Journal publication is a license to make a
small change to the world. Alongside the license comes other
prestige indicators which carry value for individuals: in today’s
academia, publications help to secure the position of academics in
universities (without them, they can lose their jobs). Beyond
publication itself, citations serve as ‘evidence’ of approval of a
community. Fame and status as a “thought leader”
[&#64;sismondo_key_2013] comes from many citations, which in turn brings
invitations to keynotes at conferences, editorial roles, expert
advisory positions, through to secondary studies of an author’s
work. Fundamentally, there is a demarcation between ‘academic
celebrity’ and everyone else: academic publication counts because it
is (or is perceived to be) scarce. This state of affairs raises
ontological questions about how the social world of science and
education works.</p></li>

listening to one another as the most important thing to do in

</ul>
<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Bohm argues that “Dialogue is really aimed at going into the whole
thought process and changing the way the thought process occurs
collectively. We haven’t really paid much attention to thought as a
process. We have engaged in thoughts, but we have only paid
attention to the content, not to the process. Why does thought
require attention? Everything requires attention, really. If we ran
machines without paying attention to them, they would break down. Or
thought, too, is a process, and it requires attention otherwise it’s
going to go wrong. “[&#64;bohm_dialogue_2013]</p></li>
<li><p>Among the symptoms of thought going wrong, Bohm cites
<em>fragmentation</em>, or what others have criticised as <em>reductionism</em>:
the breaking down of knowledge into boxes. Bohm goes on to say:
“Almost everything around us has been determined by thought – all
the buildings, factories, farms, roads, schools nations, science,
technology, religion – whatever you care to mention. The whole
ecological problem is due to thought, because we have thought that
the world is there for us to exploit, that it is infinite, and so no
matter what we did, the pollution would all get dissolved away.”</p></li>
<li><p>He points out that “we may clear up the pollution, but may then
create some other difficulty, such as economic chaos if we don’t do
it right.”</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, he argues: “The point is thought produces results, but
thought says it didn’t do it. And that is a problem.”</p></li>

<li><p>What is the role of love and friendship in managing uncertainty?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A conversation is a kind of dance. The word <em>conversation</em> comes
from the Latin, <em>con-versare</em>. It means, “to turn together”. Two
people can dance and intuitively understand the moves of the other.</p></li>
<li><p>Learning conversations are coordinations between a teacher and
learner. There are always processes of recalibration as the teacher
recognises the need to simply their own complexity so as to maintain
an effective dialogue with the learner.</p></li>
<li><p>Conversations are very powerful: they can change peoples’ lives in a
very short time. The way this happens is poorly understood, and as a
result, the importance of conversation often gets overlooked in the
way we organise institutions.</p></li>
<li><p>One of the drivers for conversation is the fact that everybody sees
the world differently and everybody feels the need to address their
uncertainties by understanding better the uncertainties of others.</p></li>
<li><p>People who have deep conversations together are often friends. This
is not to say that important conversations only happen between
friends, but that friendship is the name we give to a particular
kind of conversational relationship.</p></li>
<li><p>The root of friendship is the ability to freely express uncertainty.
Through friendship, things that would be hard to say to others, can
be said, and deep uncertainties - often about very personal
matters - can be explored.</p></li>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How do our bodies change the way we interact with others?</p></li>
<li><p>Is a thought in the brain or in the body or in a community?</p></li>
<li><p>Why does physical activity and physical contact have such a powerful
effect on the way we feel?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Most people assume that “knowing”, “learning”, “remembering”, etc
happens in brains. By implication, they mean that consciousness is a
property of the brain. There is considerable evidence to support
this: damaged brains usually produce impairment in cognitive
function. However, although sometimes radical changes in behaviour
are observed in those with damaged brains, the humanness of the
individual remains, and sometime with even severe damage to the
brain, people seem to retain cognitive function.</p></li>
<li><p>The more profound changes occur in individuals around a person with
brain damage: their behaviours change too, as accommodation is made
for cognitive impairment, extraordinary efforts are made to support
an individual in the expression of their identity in new ways which
fit their new condition. Being human, it seems, involves rather more
than an individual brain. It is not even in the “whole” person. It
is in the whole community.</p></li>
<li><p>Processes of empathy and emotional connection are not separate from
individual high level cognitive function. The separation between
cognition and emotion has partly been driven by assumptions in
neuroscience that the brain is a computer. Neurons, axons and
synapses seem like wires and connections, and the logical firing of
one neuron seems to trigger knock-on firings of connected neurons,
much in the same way that an electric signal triggers knock-on
effects in a circuit.</p></li>
<li><p>Some physicists [&#64;bohm_wholeness_2002] and neuroscientists
[&#64;damasio_descartes_2006], however, taken a different view. David
Bohm was highly aware of the importance of emotion in communication.
In fact, he believed that direct emotional engagements provided a
deeper scientific insight into the nature of the world than
rationalistic talk. His theory of Quantum Mechanics but made a
connection between the structure and process of matter, and
consciousness.</p></li>
<li><p>More recent work on the way music communicates, and particularly on

<h2>Consciousness and Biology<a class="headerlink" href="#consciousness-and-biology" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>KEY QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If brains are the result of physical processes, which ultimately
give rise to consciousness, what happens when consciousness
conceives of the physical processes which underpin it?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHY THIS MATTERS</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The connection between matter and consciousness must work through
physiology. Some like Terrence Deacon have made the connection by
examining how information works from the material world
[&#64;deacon_incomplete_2012], psychology and through evolution.</p></li>
<li><p>By focusing on those aspects of biology about which our knowledge is
rather vague - like epigenesis - Deacon has developed a theory of
mind based on the study of semiotic communication. However, if there
is a weakness to this, as with all theories of mind, it lies in the
theory’s ability to account for the way in which it thinks about
itself.</p></li>
<li><p>John Torday goes much deeper than this in a theory which draws on
Bohm’s basic idea of what he called the “holographic universe”
[&#64;bohm_wholeness_2002].</p></li>
<li><p>Consciousness, Torday argues, arises from the evolution of the cell
as the basic unit of physiology, and that cellular evolutionary
process has been driven by the cell’s adaptation to ambiguity in its
environment. Moreover, the cellular adaptive processes reflects
fundamental structural adaptations in pre-history.</p></li>
<li><p>Torday suggests that there is a pattern written throughout our flesh
which connects us to one another and to a single point of origin.</p></li>
<li><p>This might mean, for example, that when we have deep conversations,
or experience music together, that the sense of togetherness we
experience may be a recognition of the common pattern that we share
in our physiology.</p></li>
<li><p>In other words, deep thinking about our origins has the same form as
our origins themselves.</p></li>

<h2>Uncertainty and Dialogue<a class="headerlink" href="#uncertainty-and-dialogue" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>KEY QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Why does uncertainty give rise to conversation?</p></li>
<li><p>Is cellular communication similarly a response to the uncertainty in
a cell’s environment?</p></li>
<li><p>Why might mental illness result from a lack of conversation or
understanding?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The environment of all organisms is uncertain or ambiguous. It is
probably no different for humans than it is for amoebas or cells.</p></li>
<li><p>When you are unsure or uncertain about something, you talk to
people. Conversation is one of the principle means of managing
uncertainty.</p></li>
<li><p>In the biological theory of Torday
[&#64;john_s._torday_evolutionary_2012], cellular communication is
considered to be a response to the ambiguity of the cellular
environment.</p></li>
<li><p>Ambiguities and uncertainties are the result of other processes of
adaptation to uncertainty. There are patterns to the ways in which
different adaptive processes operate at different levels. In
physics, these patterns are considered to be ‘symmetries’ or ‘broken
symmetries’.</p></li>
<li><p>Broken symmetry is the process whereby quantum mechanics believes
the structure of matter - atoms, molecules, etc - emerges. Whatever
originating broken symmetry there was is written in new molecular
adaptations later on, which in turn are performed in environmental
contexts which twist the path of evolution in one way or another.
Torday’s biology emphasises the importance of stress from the
environment, which causes cellular mechanisms to stretch and acquire
new functions (swim bladders change into lungs, for example). And
consciousness could be part of the same process.</p></li>
<li><p>Understanding something deeply means becoming aware of a fundamental
pattern of broken symmetry which connects us to a common point of
origin. At its root, “understanding” and what we consider to be
“spirituality” are the same thing.</p></li>
<li><p>Because of this, dialogue and conversation become essential tools
for negotiating understanding and dealing with uncertainty. To
isolate people from understanding and dialogue is to produce the
conditions for mental illness.</p></li>
<li><p>As R.D.Laing noted, mental illness is not the sickness of the
individual. It is the sickness of their environment
[&#64;laing_divided_2010]. Being “mentally ill” is the only truly
authentic reaction to that environment, only exacerbated by the
naive attempts of others to “cure” the individual.</p></li>

<li><p>Is ecology the same as mind?</p></li>
<li><p>Is our ecological crisis the result of faulty reasoning: an error of
mind?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Gregory Bateson argued that the evolution was not about the
development of individual organisms in a process of ‘survival of the
fittest’, but about the development of ‘organism plus environment’.</p></li>
<li><p>He argued that if we see evolution as simply organisms competing
against one another, this results in a destroyed environment,
which - although it is what often happens in human system - is not
what happens in natural systems.</p></li>
<li><p>In considering the unit of evolution as ‘organism plus environment’,
he argued that this meant that the organism’s <em>idea</em> of the
environment had to be taken into consideration. In effect, this
meant that in order to understand evolution, we have to understand
‘mind’.</p></li>
<li><p>Bateson talked of an ‘ecology of mind’ as the realisation of the
‘pattern which connects’. This is rather difficult to understand -
and certainly open to interpretation of a kind of loose ecological
thinking that sees ‘interconnectedness’ without necessarily
inquiring into exactly what is connected, or even what a
‘connection’ or ‘pattern’ means.</p></li>
<li><p>Our ecological crisis does provide an indication that Bateson was
right. Since our systems of economics, politics, education, media
and so on all see the world as ‘competing organisms’, we seem
incapable of preventing the destruction of our environment.</p></li>

<li><p>Why is talking so powerful in psychotherapy?</p></li>
<li><p>What is so special about talking about profound things?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>All approaches to psychotherapy, whether those of Freud, Jung, Adler
or the family therapy of Laing, involve conversation.</p></li>
<li><p>Whilst we tend to think of conversation as merely the exchange of
words, in psychotherpeutic contexts, words have very powerful
effects (as they can also have in education).</p></li>
<li><p>In many branches of psychotherapy, for example, patients are
encouraged to talk about their dreams. Freud’s theory for this was
that dreams were an aspect of the subconscious, and that in order to
help the patient, a re-wiring had to be made between the
subconscious world in the patient and the conscious real world
outside.</p></li>
<li><p>The difficulty that many have with Freud’s theories is that it is
very hard to scientifically identify the subconscious, or the
distinction between it and the conscious mind. In the end, all we
have to go on is the communication between people.</p></li>
<li><p>In the social systems theory of Niklas Luhmann
[&#64;luhmann_social_1996], Luhmann speculated that in talking, we make
a series of ‘selections’: we select a meaning - the thing we want to
say, and we select an utterance - the way we choose to say it.</p></li>
<li><p>Luhmann further speculated that our selections are dependent on the
selections of others, and that in making these selections we
contribute to our social environment.</p></li>
<li><p>If the cause of mental illness is in the mismatch between the
subconscious world and the social environment, then the
transformation of the social world by drawing things up from the
subconscious can make an important difference to mental state.</p></li>

<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>We communicate with each other as whole persons, not just brains or
mouths.</p></li>
<li><p>Our bodies are capable of a range of emotions and attitudes
including love, anger, empathy, fear and pride together with
intellectual abilities including problem solving, creating and
remembering.</p></li>
<li><p>We recognise the difference between these activities partly by the
way they make us feel.</p></li>
<li><p>The way different emotions and behaviours make us feel changes the
way we use our bodies to express ourselves.</p></li>
<li><p>In Neuro-linguistic programming, for example, studies have been done
on the ways that individuals move their eyes if they are remembering
things, or creating things.</p></li>
<li><p>It many academic disciplines, there are different approaches to a
topic. Each approach has its own traditions, journals and
communities. Three major approaches are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Functionalism - an approach which attempts to identify problems
and seek solutions. Often functional approaches seek to use
technology to solve complex human problems, and often these
approaches fail. ‘Giant Mirrors in Space’ is a functionalist
approach to global warming, for example.</p></li>
<li><p>Critical theory - this is an approach which criticises
functionalist approaches. It is politically driven, deriving
from Marxism, and often considers the down-sided of
functionalism, particularly who loses, whose rights are
violated, and so on.</p></li>
<li><p>Phenomenology and Existentialism - this is an approach which
focuses on human experience and consciousness. It opposes
functionalism because it sees functionalist approaches as cold
and blind to real people. It is sometimes critical of critical
theory because Marxist approaches tend to be focused on the
collective rather than the individual.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>To be critical, or to be functionalist or to be focused on
individual human experience are attitudes which seem to feel
different in the body.</p></li>
<li><p>In discussion, it is sometimes possible to tell from what position
an individual is coming by looking at how they use their body. For
example, functionalists are always inventing and creating things in
their head. Phenomenologists are often thinking about emotions,
feelings and experience, which is more concerned with the heart. To
be critical, by contrast, is something that is often felt in the
gut!</p></li>

action of transacting is constitutive of the institutions through
which transactions are exchanged, patterns of communicative
transactions across different industries can lead to dynamics
whereby management functions within institutions become coordinated

<h2>Viable Systems<a class="headerlink" href="#viable-systems" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>KEY QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What is the difference between a living system like a bee-hive and a
business?</p></li>
<li><p>Are there common organising principles which unite all living
things?</p></li>
<li><p>Are there common organisational dangers which can lead to the death
of any living thing?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Beer’s Viable System Model (VSM) describes multiple levels of
organisation in an organism in an environment. Each level is a kind
of conversion of one form of information into another: what is
called a ‘transduction’</p></li>
<li><p>In the VSM, five ‘regulating mechanisms’ are specified whose job is
to maintain the viability of the whole entity. The purpose of the
system is to manage complexity, which is measured by how much
‘variety’ the system possesses. Beer explains that “the regulator
has to be capable of generating a variety equivalent to the variety
that has to be regulated – or the regulator will fail”.
[&#64;beer_heart_1995].</p></li>
<li><p>An organism’s variety is managed in relation to the variety of its
environment. Typically, the environment is more complex (has higher
variety) than the organism.</p></li>
<li><p>If the variety of the environment overwhelms the system, then the
system is at risk of collapse through unmanageable oscillation
(competing for resources) amongst the system’s components. The
viable system must attenuate the variety of the environment and
amplify its own operations in order to ensure viable operation.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="_images/VSM.jpg" /></p>
</li>
<li><p>The different regulating systems are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>System 1: the components which actually ‘do the work’ on the
ground: the meaningful different activities that a business has
to do.</p></li>
<li><p>System 2: is responsible for ensuring that the different
activities of system 1 do not conflict with each other.</p></li>
<li><p>System 3: is responsible for ensuring adequate resources are
provided to the different components in system 1. It is
responsible for ‘operational management’</p></li>
<li><p>System 4: is responsible for ‘strategic management’. It’s role
is to inspect the environment of the system and look for threats
and opportunities, instructing system 3 about what might need to
change</p></li>
<li><p>System 5: is responsible for maintaining the balance between
system 3 and system 4. In doing so, it maintains the identity of
the whole system.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Beer’s VSM is a recursive model. Each element in system 1 has
exactly the same form (systems 1 - 5) as the higher level system
that contains it.</p></li>
<li><p>You can imagine the VSM mapped on to a person:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>System 1 represents all the daily things that you do.. talking
to people, using technology, reading this, and so on.</p></li>
<li><p>System 2 represents the rules that you use to ensure that all
the things that you do do not conflict with one another. This is
a bit like a schedule or a to-do list.</p></li>
<li><p>System 3 represents planning for the tasks ahead: making sure
you have the equipment you need, enough time, and so on.</p></li>
<li><p>System 4 represents your thinking about possible threats and
opportunities in the future. System 4 is about imagination and
dreams for the future. It has to talk to System 3 to tell it how
System 3 might need to reprioritise things.</p></li>
<li><p>System 5 is your identity, it maintains a balance of the other
systems in the environment so that you present a coherent
statement of who you are to others.</p></li>

<h2>Cool tools: Keep Clicking!<a class="headerlink" href="#cool-tools-keep-clicking" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>KEY QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Why are there more and more cool things on the internet?</p></li>
<li><p>Why does Facebook, Twitter, VK, etc want you to keep clicking on
cool tools?</p></li>
<li><p>Is fake news driven by politics or is it driven by the commercial
requirements of platform companies to maintain user transactions?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>‘Cool’ tools increase the transaction count in ways which users are
not aware. This is particularly true of online gaming platforms,
fitness trackers, AI Bots and new technological experiences like
Virtual Reality. In these cases, tiny transactions of data feeds
give information about aspects of behaviour which users themselves
are unaware: the movement of the head and eyes in virtual reality, a
person’s heart rate, location information, particular phrases used
by people talking to a Bot, or learning processes as a game player
solves a puzzle. In each case, the data can be harvested. Since
users are increasingly operating within the defined constraints of
online platforms, the data can help adjust those constraints in
particular ways so as to steer behaviour. Machine learning can
record patterns of interaction and make inferences about behaviour
to steer users towards serving the needs of the corporations who
provide the communications services.</p></li>
<li><p>The economics behind the ‘fun’ of new ‘cool’ technology drives
continual innovation online. Every week, we see news of some new
technology that facilitates new forms of interaction: it might be a
new computer game, or some new service for translation (like Google
translate’s magical ability to automatically identify text in images
and translate it), or a new feature in SnapChat, or voice-activated
devices like Amazon’s echo, or Virtual reality, or a new phone app.
One of the exciting things about technology is that we struggle to
imagine what will become possible next year.</p></li>
<li><p>Every innovation is the same in the sense that every innovation
seeks to engage users in interaction. Without interaction, without
increased transactions, the innovation dies alongside its corporate
infrastructure.</p></li>
<li><p>It is only through the transactions with a company’s services that
the company exists. And it is only by harvesting the data from those
transactions that the company can make profits. The online service
company has to create the conditions for the exchange of many
transactions and use the intelligence it gathers from those
transactions to:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>provide targeted advertising services;</p></li>
<li><p>provide analytic services to other corporate clients;</p></li>
<li><p>steer user behaviour by constraining the information environment
in the platform in directions which favour corporate clients;</p></li>
<li><p>steer the userbase of the platform into new practices and
services which increase their engagement and broaden the
network.</p></li>

<h2>Hierarchies<a class="headerlink" href="#hierarchies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>KEY QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Do we need kings, presidents, bosses and institutions?</p></li>
<li><p>How might the world look if there was no hierarchy?</p></li>
<li><p>Does technology want to do what an institution does?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Universities, churches, schools, armies, governments, corporations
and scout groups, are organised hierarchically. That means there is
a boss at the top (a high-priest, king, vice-chancellor, president,
rector) and there are departments below them, each with a head, and
under each division there are divisional-heads, with umpteen
sub-divisions under them, when finally there are individual workers
whose function is to ensure that their divisional head can’t be
blamed for anything.</p></li>
<li><p>Human hierarchies serve multiple functions. They codify the division
of labour within an organisation, they provide a structure for
managing complexity of an organisation, and - perhaps most
importantly - they provide ‘lines of responsibility’ which
apportions credit and blame to different members of an organisation
when their sections either succeed or fail.</p></li>
<li><p>Because of this, they also serve to maintain a degree of conformity
with the standards and expectation of the person at the top of the
hierarchy. In a University, hierarchy also reinforces the
structuring of knowledge as it has emerged through the curriculum.</p></li>
<li><p>Those at the top of hierarchies can make declarations about what
becomes real for others in the organisation: the president can
declare new laws, the head of a university can declare new rules for
examinations, and so on.</p></li>
<li><p>Hierarchies also declare that some things are scarce: for example, a
bank declares that money is scarce, and in so doing, it upholds its
value.</p></li>

<h2>Attenuation in Hierarchies<a class="headerlink" href="#attenuation-in-hierarchies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>KEY QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How much information about an organisation can the boss absorb?</p></li>
<li><p>How much information is lost in the process of reporting what is
actually happening in a business?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The underlying principle of hierarchy is <em>attenuation</em>. Highly
complex phenomena carries a rich variety of descriptions which has
to be squeezed to single description summaries of ‘what is going on’
that the senior management team can absorb.</p></li>
<li><p>In any institutional hierarchy, this attenuation works both in a
‘vertical’ way, from the bottom of an organisation to the top, and
in a ‘horizontal’ way, whereby each individual has to attenuate the
complexity of the totality of the environment within which they
live. Since each individual is every other individual’s environment,
any organisation features horizontal attenuation at all levels
between all individuals. Figure
<a class="reference external" href="#fig:hierarchyattenuate">[fig:hierarchyattenuate]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:hierarchyattenuate”} shows the patterns of
attenuation and the division of knowledge in the institutional
structure.</p>
<p><img alt="The attenuations ofhierarchy[]{label=&quot;fig:hierarchyattenuate&quot;}" src="Slide5" />{#fig:hierarchyattenuate
width=”columnwidth”}</p>
</li>
<li><p>This diagram is however, simplistic. Humans, like other animals,
shape their environment to suit themselves. From the attenuation of
the environment to simple organisational principles, humans amplify
these organisational principles by making changes to their
environment such that their organising principles provide a reliable
way of coordinating themselves. This action to shape the environment
represents the opposite of attenuation: it is an amplification of an
individual’s understanding of their environment.</p></li>
<li><p>In modern organisations, the attenuation process from bottom to top,
and from the environment to the individual, is driven by
<em>information</em>: data on everything from class attendance, student
surveys, pass rates and student fee income is collected and
processed to assist organisational decision-making. Impressive
though this range of data is, and hypnotic our modern data analytic
software, such information is always constraint - it is always a
tool of attenuation. What gets left out? Unfortunately, what is left
out often reveals itself as a menacing force appearing from nowhere
which produces sudden shocks to hierarchies. Such is the story of
most recent institutional crises from the financial collapse of
banks and corporations, child abuse in the church, illegal behaviour
of journalists, health scandals, abuse of power by Hollywood moguls
and the expenses of politicians.</p></li>

<h2>Are Hierarchies Sustainable in a world of Uncertainty?<a class="headerlink" href="#are-hierarchies-sustainable-in-a-world-of-uncertainty" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>KEY QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Do institutional hierarchies contribute to the conditions that might
threaten them?</p></li>
<li><p>Are there alternative forms of organisation which are not
hierarchical?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Many human hierarchical organisations have experienced shocks and
crises of confidence in recent years (for example, child abuse in
the Catholic church, scandals in the press, government scandals,
corporate failures). In some cases, these institutions appear out of
control.</p></li>
<li><p>These scandals are ‘shocks’ from the environment to which the
institution has to respond. Their effect is to reveal that the
environment within which the institution thought it was operating
with some certainty, suddenly turns out to be <em>uncertain</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Institutions respond to this uncertainty with bureaucratic
processes: there are inquiries, restructures, people responsible are
identified and removed, and so on. The effect and the motivation of
these processes is to preserve the institution’s structure. The
critically important thing is that most institutions have to react
to environmental uncertainties which they themselves create! How
does this happen?</p>
<p>Figure
 <a class="reference external" href="#fig:uncertaininstitution">[fig:uncertaininstitution]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:uncertaininstitution”} shows the dynamic relationship
between environmental uncertainty and the institution’s response to
it as a positive feedback loop.</p>
<p><img alt="The positive feedback between institutional hierarchy and anincreasingly uncertainenvironment[]{label=&quot;fig:uncertaininstitution&quot;}" src="Slide8" />{#fig:uncertaininstitution
width=”columnwidth”}</p>
</li>
<li><p>Hierarchies are uncommon in nature: the natural world is
<em>ecological</em>, where differences between elements which might appear
to be in a hierarchy (say, the levels of the food chain) are
interlinked in ways which mean that domination by one level over
another leads to catastrophe.</p></li>
<li><p>Equally, the brain is not the boss of the body. The body comprises
multiple components which work together coordinated by signals
passed through the central nervous system.</p></li>
<li><p>In the natural world, in place of hierarchy, we see circularity.
This is because natural structures seek viability and adaptability
in response to a changing environment. Circular organisational
structures help achieve this through continual organic adaptation.</p></li>

<h2>Predicting Technology<a class="headerlink" href="#predicting-technology" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>KEY QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How can we predict the ‘next thing’ in technology?</p></li>
<li><p>What do computers do to organisations and society?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>To understand the potential social impact of technology is to
understand the relationship between technology and institutions.
Both technology and institutions mediate transactions between
people. In both cases, this mediation is conducted against a
background of risk.</p></li>
<li><p>Predictions about the impact of technology can be made in two ways.
On the one hand, we can seek to establish trends from a wide variety
of observed phenomena. This approach is called ‘synthetic’.
Alternatively, we can analyse the deeper underlying mechanisms which
produce today’s phenomena, and to draw out from those mechanisms the
phenomena which might present us tomorrow. This approach is called
‘analytic’.</p></li>
<li><p>An example of a successful analytical approach to technology
prediction is contained in Winograd and Flores’s book “Understanding
computers and cognition”, which was published in 1986
[&#64;winograd_understanding_1986] Winograd and Flores sought to
identify the underlying mechanisms which produced the technology of
their time using cybernetic analysis and philosophy. Their
conclusion was strongly critical of the prevailing ‘synthetic’
understanding of technology in the pre-internet age that computers
were about data processing and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Whilst
the superficial appearances of technology suggested that AI and data
indicated the future, Winograd and Flores’s analytical approach
identified human communication as the domain of fundamental
transformation by computers in 1986, and which, they argued, would
continue to be changed in the future (this was before the Worldwide
Web)</p></li>
<li><p>Within a few years it became obvious that they were right. The
‘workflow’ technology which they pioneered on the back of their
philosophical and technological critique became one of the major
components of corporate IT communications infrastructure.</p></li>
<li><p>Their argument was that computers were both constructed <em>in
langauge</em> and were tools <em>of language</em> focused on the ‘speech acts’
which are performed through computers (drawing on the Speech act
theory of Austin and Searle).</p></li>
<li><p>Computers recorded speech acts, and through them the commitments
which human beings make to each other - those exchanges which are
critical to the establishment of trust between human beings - can be
managed and tracked, even to the point that eventually</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>New computer-based communication technology can help anticipate
and avoid breakdowns … we can partially anticipate situations
where breakdowns are likely to occur (by noting their recurrence)
and we can provide people with the tools and procedures they need
to cope with them. Moreover, new conversational networks can be
designed that give the organisation the ability to recognise and
realise new possibilities. [&#64;winograd_understanding_1986]</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>The fact that the computer kept a <em>record</em> of all the speech acts
that everyone made was for Winograd and Flores the critical issue.
Curiously, despite their anti-AI stance, this basic idea of storing
and analysing speech acts lies behind what we now consider to be the
major achievements of modern AI: social media on the internet
provides the ‘big data’ from which data mining techniques identify
precisely what Winograd and Flores were articulating: Ways of
anticipating - and potentially avoiding - breakdown.</p></li>

<h2>Transactions and Institutions<a class="headerlink" href="#transactions-and-institutions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>KEY QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What is the role of institutions in brokering the transactions
between individuals?</p></li>
<li><p>What is technology doing to the management of transactions in
businesses?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The impact of computers on most industries, from retail to finance,
has been an ever-increasing atomisation of transaction processing
alongside ever more sophisticated means of orchestrating different
transaction processing services.</p></li>
<li><p>The relationship between transactions and institutions was first
studied in the 1930s in the economic work of Ronald
Coase[&#64;coase_firm_1990]. In developing his theory, Coase argued that
economics was upside-down. It concentrated on the means for
producing economic outcomes, but ignored the social entities through
which the means and ends of economics were negotiated. Coase
highlighted that there was in economics no questioning about the
existence of markets, banks, firms, governments and so on. His
suggestion was to see that social entities like markets were created
through the transactions which individuals created with them:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>the operation of a market costs something and by forming an
organisation and allowing some authority (an “entrepreneur”) to
direct the resources, certain marketing costs are saved. The
entrepreneur has to carry out his function at less cost, taking
into account the fact that he may get factors of production at a
lower price than the market transactions which he supersedes,
because it is always possible to revert to the open market if he
fails to do this. [&#64;coase_firm_1990]</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>The establishment of an institution like a market arose because the
cost of transactions between a seller and their customers could be
reduced by the entrepreneurial creation of an entity to broker
exchange between individuals. Coase goes on to discuss the role of
technology in facilitating transactions:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Inventions which tend to bring factors of production nearer
together, by lessening spatial distribution, tend to increase the
size of the firm. Changes like the telephone and the telegraph
which tend to reduce the cost of organising spatially will tend to
increase the size of the firm.</p>

<li><p>What does Facebook have to do to keep and increase users?</p></li>

<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The fall in the number of transactions which Twitter experienced has
had a significant effect on Twitter’s share
price[&#64;noauthor_twitter_2016]. Equally, the price demanded by
Snapchat is dependent on the number of transactions which it
produces. This is the essential index of the ‘coolness’ of the
technology [&#64;noauthor_snapchat_2017].</p></li>
<li><p>Each social media corporation seeks to increase the transactions its
customers have. The conventional rationale for maintaining this is
that whilst customers are contributing transactions to the
corporations they are more likely to see advertising.</p></li>

more.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Customer trust is critical to all businesses. If customers lose
trust in a company, it goes out of business.</p></li>
<li><p>The web has been used as a tool for the coordination of contracts
between buyers and sellers since the dot-com boom of the early
2000s. This has relied on the establishment of trust in online
payments.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="_images/rouble.jpg" /></p>
</li>
<li><p>Trust on the internet is managed by algorithms which encode credit
card details and other information in forms which mean that these
details remain private. Imagine if the cryptographic keys which
maintain trust in online payments are hacked, and no online payments
could be secure anymore. What would be the implications?</p></li>
<li><p>Although we think we trust companies like Paypal or Mastercard,
really we are putting our trust in these cryptographic algorithms.</p></li>

uphold trust in other services like selling goods, hotels, taxis,
travel, etc.</p></li>

<h2>Worldwide Web Decentralisation and Institutions<a class="headerlink" href="#worldwide-web-decentralisation-and-institutions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>KEY QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Why is centralisation of the worldwide web a problem?</p></li>
<li><p>What might decentralisation mean for businesses?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>When Tim Berners-Lee invented the worldwide web, he envisaged a
platform which would remove barriers of access to information and
overcome the limitations of hierarchical structures in institutions.</p></li>
<li><p>What’s actually happened to the worldwide web is that it has
reproduced institutional hierarchies, and now the internet is
dominated by a handful of (mostly American) companies: Google,
Facebook, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>This has also produced problems in terms of privacy and data
management, and user worries about surveillance.</p></li>
<li><p>The reasons why this has happened are partly technical and partly to
do with trust. Technically, the internet relies on a protocol called
<em>Hypertext Transport Protocol</em> (http) which identifies individual
servers as the source of files and gives them a name. When we type
“<a class="reference external" href="http://google.com">google.com</a>” we are accessing files on Google’s server’s.</p></li>
<li><p>Because results from Google become trusted, more and more people use
Google, giving them more data, and increasing their market value.</p></li>
<li><p>Web decentralisation works by not storing files on particular
servers, but rather distributing files and servers across many
machines in the internet.</p></li>
<li><p>The location of a file is no longer a particular server, but a code
which reassembles the file from many different machines.</p></li>
<li><p>What this means is that the transactions of users are no longer with
a particular company which acts as a broker, but with specific files
which are distributed. Potentially this can disrupt centralised
businesseses because they no longer control access to files: files
are distributed.</p></li>

<li><p>Is big data just counting?</p></li>
<li><p>Can big data be intelligent?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Data analysis, whether the data is big or small is really all about
counting. Typically, ‘big data’ may involve the counting of words or
clicks on a webpage. But what makes ‘big data’ so countable? What,
in fact are we counting? When is one click the same as another?</p></li>
<li><p>The counting that Facebook and other social media companies do does
seem to be remarkably effective. It is able to make prediction about
the social status and economic value of individual users, it is able
to predict how they might vote, and it is able to target them with
advertising that fits their profile.</p></li>
<li><p>Google translate does a remarkable job in converting one language to
another by simply counting words.</p></li>
<li><p>Text analysis software, which Google translate relies on, works by
counting individual words, and groups of words. For example, a
bigram is group of two adjacent words (“the cat”, “cat sat”,
“sat on”), and equally we can count trigrams, with 3 words.</p></li>
<li><p>However, it may be going too far to say that intelligence results
from counting. The counting removes uncertainties about things, and
presents summaries of a person or a translation which may or may not
be correct. However, such summaries are never <em>complete</em>: in any
process of counting, what is not counted is usually the most
important thing.</p></li>

<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The idea of quantifying anything is problematic, and in order to
quantify, a key distinction has to be made about what is the ‘same’
as something else. All quantities are, at some level, <em>relations</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Bateson argues: “It is impossible, in principle, to explain any
pattern by invoking a single quantity. But note that a ratio between
two quantities is already the beginning of pattern. In others words,
quantity and pattern are of different logical type and do not
readily fit together in the same thinking. “[&#64;bateson_steps_1987]</p></li>
<li><p>Counting is the determination and aggregation of things which are
like one another (analogies), and of surprises - or anomalies.
Analogies are not determinable without the determination of

If scientists didn’t agree what they were counting then coherent
scientific discourse would not be possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Whenever you see a data analytical report, you should always ask
“What is being counted?”, “What is considered to be the same?”,
“What is considered to be different?”</p></li>
<li><p>Agreement of analogies and anomalies is a conversation between
scientists. Without actual embodied participation in the phenomena
which produce the analogies and anomalies, there is no way of
coordinating the conversation. Without any way of coordinating the
conversation, there is an encroaching mysticism in the whole process
of data analysis.</p></li>
<li><p>Data risks becoming a kind of religion divorced from science.
Education driven by data in this way is also divorced from science.
We end up in the worst-case scenario: an educational system
renouncing the humanities and arts because they are unscientific,
whilst embracing a science which is in the thrall of unreliable data
analysis!</p></li>

<h2>Senders and Receivers<a class="headerlink" href="#senders-and-receivers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>KEY QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What must a sender do to a message to ensure that it is correctly
received?</p></li>
<li><p>How might the ‘noise’ of the channel of communication be overcome?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Imagine you are trying to communicate to somebody in a noisy room
where there is a distance between you and the other person. What do
you do? Shout? Wave your arms? Text them? Maybe you try all sorts of
things. What you are doing is trying to say the thing you want to
say in many different ways. This is amplification.</p></li>
<li><p>Shannon drew a diagram indicating the basic hurdle of
communication - some kind of amplification was required.</p></li>
<li><p>For Shannon, amplification requires the adding of ‘redundancy’.
Redundancy might mean adding extra bits to the message to ensure
that the differences in entropy between the different symbols would
still be apparent even if the transmission was degraded. To do this,
Shannon argued that <em>redundancy</em> was a critical element in message
transmission.</p></li>
<li><p>If redundancy was added by adding extra bits to the message then it
meant that the bandwidth between the sender and the receiver should
be increased. If redundancy was added through repetition,
transmission would be slower.</p></li>
<li><p>So by calculating the complexity of the message to be sent, the
degradation of the signal on the medium over a distance, and the
amount of redundancy that was needed to be added in order to counter
the effects of degradation, Shannon was able to calculate the
necessary bandwidth for transmission.</p></li>
<li><p>Although he never considered that his mathematical theory was
applicable outside the domain of electronic communication, Shannon’s
theory and ideas about redundancy have been very useful in
understanding human communication.</p></li>

<li><p>Can the information in something be calculated?</p></li>
<li><p>Can knowledge be calculated?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Shannon’s Information theory calculations are detailed in his book
“A Mathematical Theory of Communication”
[&#64;shannon_mathematical_1949]. In this book, he adapted Boltzmann’s
idea of thermodynamic entropy (which was a measure of heat
dispersion) into a measure of the surprisingness of messages
transmitted through a medium.</p></li>
<li><p>Information theory underpins the principles of digital
communication, compression and encryption. Without it, we would not
have the basic mechanics of the internet, let alone the transmission
of video, audio, pictures or text which is carried over it.</p></li>
<li><p>It has found application beyond technology: in biology, Shannon
entropy has been used as an index of biological growth, of ecosystem
development [&#64;odum_fundamentals_1959] and epigenesis
[&#64;deacon_incomplete_2012]; in physics, it is used to explore quantum
mechanics and quantum computing [&#64;results_programming_2007];</p></li>
<li><p>in the social sciences, it is used to explore scientific discourse
and big data [&#64;leydesdorff_knowledge-based_2006]; in geography, it
is used to understand urban development [&#64;haken_information_2015];</p></li>
<li><p>in neuroscience it is used to explore the working of the brain
[&#64;ashby_design_2013]; in anthropology, it is used to explore
cultural behaviour [&#64;bateson_steps_1987]; in the arts, it is used to
explore aesthetics [&#64;kanach_formalized_1992].</p></li>
<li><p>Information theory measures the complexity of a message by
calculating the probability of each event and producing an index of
the ‘average surprisingness’ of a sequence of messages expressed in
terms of the number of ‘bits’ or on-off switches which would be
required to transmit a message of this complexity.</p></li>
<li><p>Information is not the same a meaning. Shannon never believed that
meaning could be understood through his theory, although other

believe that deeper issues of meaning can be understood in this way.</p></li>

<h2>How Information Theory Works<a class="headerlink" href="#how-information-theory-works" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>KEY QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How does Information Theory provide an index to complexity?</p></li>
<li><p>Why is it useful?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Consider a very simple message:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>A A A A A A A A</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>For each symbol in a message, we can calculate its surprisingness by
multiplying its probability by the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(log_2\)</span> of its probability. The
total surprisingness of the message is the sum of this calculation
for all the different symbols which appear. With 8 A’s, the number
of symbols is 1, and the probability of A appearing is 1. The <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(log\)</span>
of 1 is 0, therefore, the surprisingness of the message is
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1 times 0 = 0\)</span>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now consider this sequence:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>A A B A A A A B</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Here, there are two symbols, so we calculate the probability of each
symbol and multiply it by the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(log\)</span> of the probability of each
symbol. So the probability of A is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(frac{6}{8}\)</span> and the probability
of B is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(frac{2}{8} = frac{1}{4}\)</span>. Information theory calculates
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(log\)</span>s to base 2. This is because in digital signals, something can
be either <em>on</em> or <em>off</em>. Shannon’s central problem which he sought
to address was how many <em>on/off</em> switches would be required to
transmit a particular message with a particular degree of
surprisingness. There had to be enough switches to generate the
<em>variety</em> of different symbols that were required to be sent.</p>
<p>So we can use <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(log_2\)</span> to calculate <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(log_2 frac{6}{8} = -0.415\)</span> and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(log_2 frac{1}{4} = -2\)</span>. Now we multiply these <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(log\)</span> values with
the probability of those values to give
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(frac{6}{8} times -0.415 = -0.311\)</span> and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(frac{1}{4} times -2 = 0.5\)</span>. Adding them together gives <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(-0.811\)</span>.
So the addition of an extra symbol produces quite a jump in entropy.
Note, if there was only one B in a sea of A’s, then the average
surprisingness would be <em>higher</em>: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(log_2frac{1}{8} = -3\)</span> and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(log_2frac{7}{8} = -0.192\)</span>, and multiplying these by the
probabilities gives: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(frac{1}{8} times -3 = -0.375\)</span> and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(frac{7}{8} times -0.192 = -0.168\)</span> giving a total of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0.543\)</span>.</p>

<h2>Shannon Redundancy<a class="headerlink" href="#shannon-redundancy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>KEY QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is saying the same thing many times, in many different ways a waste
or a necessity?</p></li>
<li><p>How much of life is repetition?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Redundancy basically means repeating something. However, things can
be repeated in different ways: you can send a text, make a phone
call, send a letter, make a video, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Redundancy is important because it is the way in which we try to
ensure that a message is sent successfully and its meaning is
understood.</p></li>
<li><p>In Shannon information theory, the challenge was to send a message
over a ‘noisy’ medium (think of a noisy room). In Shannon’s theory,
this might mean repeating the message, adding extra bits to check
the transmission, or to present the same message in a different way.
In fact, whichever technique is used, redundancy amounts to
<em>creating alternative descriptions of the same thing</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>When we talk to each other, very often the same idea gets expressed
in many different ways. The act of teaching is about finding many
ways in which a concept can be explained (‘think about it like
this’, ‘do this exercise’, ‘let me tell you a story…’)</p></li>
<li><p>In Shannon’s theory, redundancy is a way of thinking about the rules
which say that some symbols are used more often than others. In
language, this is called a grammar. Once somebody knows the grammar,
messages are more easily understood.</p></li>
<li><p>Redundancy is the inverse of information. If information is the
‘figure’, redundancy is the ‘background’.</p></li>

<h2>Probability<a class="headerlink" href="#probability" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>KEY QUESTIONS</strong></p>

<li><p>What is the difference between the chance of rolling a 6 with dice,
and the chance of it raining tomorrow?</p></li>
<li><p>If you are told you have a 2% chance of having a heart attack, what
does that mean?</p></li>
<li><p>Is improbability the same as surprisingness?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The mathematical theory of probability focuses on those situations,
such as games, where the number of possible options is clearly
known.</p></li>
<li><p>Many events in daily life do not have this property: the number of
possible factors and options is often unknown.</p></li>
<li><p>Some things which might be described as ‘improbable’ are
‘surprising’. However, what is perceived as surprising might be
subjective ignorance rather than objective probability.</p></li>
<li><p>However in modern statistics and game theory, uncertainties over the
maximum number of possible events is often overlooked: instead real
situations are treated like abstract ‘game’ situations.</p></li>
<li><p>The problem of surprisingness is related to the issue of induction:
that if something has happened before, it becomes more likely to
happen again. Again, this assumption can be unreliable.</p></li>
<li><p>Probability is very important in quantum mechanics because there is
no certainty about the position of a subatomic particle until it is
observed. Therefore, the position of the particle is represented by
a ‘wave function’ which is effectively a map of the probabilities of
the particle at different positions. These probability distributions
are, however, accurate in making predictions - a feature that has
been exploited in quantum computing.</p></li>

<h2>Ergodicity<a class="headerlink" href="#ergodicity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>KEY QUESTION</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is the complexity of something over a period of time the same as the
complexity of that thing over a different period of time?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the difference in complexity from one period of time to
another?</p></li>
<li><p>How does complexity change?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHY DOES THIS MATTER?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ergodicity is a statistical property of system whereby a measure of
its behaviour over a particular time period is seen to be the same
as a measure of its behaviour over a long period. It’s often used in
information theory as a way of describing the Shannon entropy of a
system over one period of time to another. For example, Shannon
measured the entropy of the English language as a distribution of
letters. This measurement is ergodic to the extent that the shorter
sample contains a representative sample of the grammar and syntax of
the language, and that over a larger sample the value of the entropy
of the language is no different.</p></li>
<li><p>The principles of ergodicity rely on some assumptions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>the “alphabet” of what is counted is made explicit at the
beginning and does not change.</p></li>
<li><p>the constraints which determine the distribution of symbols do
not change</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Shannon’s reticence to apply information theory to the study of
meaning, or the more profound features of living systems rested, I
believe, on the fact that he knew that with living systems, neither
of these assumptions about ergodicity are true.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Living systems do not present a complete countable “alphabet” of
things to count at the outset. Countable things are emergent: before
you have fingers, you have cells. Partly this is because the second
assumption is wrong - the constraints within which living things
grow and adapt are continually changing. Indeed, the very process of
life is a process of auto-generating constraint - what the
biologists call “autocatalysis”.</p></li>
<li><p>Learning, for example, is part of a living process. Learning
conversations are rather like dances where nobody quite knows the
rules, and indeed, the rules change as it goes along. But somehow
the whole thing has coherence. This is a mystery which I believe the
analysis of music can help illuminate. Both music and learning
conversations develop by creating new constraints and emerging new
significant (countable) things. The dynamics and effectiveness of a
learning conversation, as a piece of music, rests on how those
constraints interact. It turns out that each new expression is a
redundant expression - it says something that has already been said
before but in a different way.</p></li>
